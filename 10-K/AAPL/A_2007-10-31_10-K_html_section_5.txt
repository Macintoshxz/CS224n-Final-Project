Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol "A". For the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, the high and low sale prices per quarter as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system for the New York Stock Exchange are as: As of October 31, 2007, there were 48,254 stockholders of record of common stock. The closing share price for our common stock on October 31, 2007, as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system for the New York Stock Exchange, was $36.85. 
We have not paid any cash dividends to date, and we currently intend to retain any future income to fund the development and growth of our business and fund stock repurchases from time to time. Our management and Board of Directors continually evaluate our capitalization strategy.

33 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION The following table summarizes information about our equity compensation plans as of October 31, 2007. All outstanding awards relate to our common stock. 
(1) The number of securities remaining available for future issuance in column (c) includes 24,827,099 shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "423(b) Plan"). The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 423(b) Plan are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding common stock of Agilent or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the 423(b) Plan, in no event shall the aggregate number of shares issued under the Plan exceed 75 million shares. The number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights in column (a) does not include shares of common stock issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participant contributions under the 423(b) Plan totaling $31,631,591 million as of October 31, 2007. 
(2) We issue securities under our equity compensation plans in forms other than options, warrants or rights. Under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan, (the "Stock Plan"), we may issue Stock Awards, including but not limited to restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance units, as defined in the Stock Plan. Under the terms of the Stock Plan, no more than 10 percent of the total shares available for issuance under the Stock Plan will constitute restricted stock awards. Under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the "1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan"), we may issue Special Compensation, as that term is defined in Section 7 of the 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. 
(3) We issue securities under our equity compensation plans in forms which do not require a payment by the recipient to us at the time of exercise or vesting, including restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units. Accordingly, the weighted-average exercise price in column (b) does not take these awards into account. 
STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE GRAPH The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return, assuming the investment of $100 (and the reinvestment of any dividends thereafter) for the period beginning on October 31, 2002, and ending on October 31, 2007, on each of: Agilent's common stock; the S&P 500 Index; and two Peer Groups. The first Peer Group is composed of companies that are members of the S&P Information Technology Index and the S&P Healthcare Index that compete in sectors related to Agilent's businesses ("Prior Peer Group"). The sectors are Electronic Equipment Manufacturers, Communications Equipment and Healthcare Equipment. These sectors were selected by Agilent. The individual 34 companies that comprise those three sectors are chosen and maintained by S&P. This is the last year that we will compare ourselves to this peer group. We are changing our peer group, see "New Peer Group", to a peer group that consists of high technology and measurement public companies in the S&P Information Technology Sector, excluding the Software and Services Groups and including the S&P Healthcare Equipment Group. Going forward, this will be the peer group against which we will compare ourselves as this aligns with the group that Agilent uses to benchmark its executives' compensation and set target pay, as well as metrics under its long-term performance program. Agilent's stock price performance shown in the following graph is not indicative of future stock price performance. The data for this performance graph was compiled for us by Standard and Poor's.
