Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 56 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Agilent Technologies, Inc.: We have completed integrated audits of Agilent Technologies, Inc.'s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, and an audit of its 2004 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. 
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" as of November 1, 2005 and changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in fiscal 2006. 
Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the 57 design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

62 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 16 percent of our stock in November 1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). HP distributed the remaining 84 percent of our stock to its stockholders on June 2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend. 
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. The results of our semiconductor products business are presented as a discontinued operation for all periods in the consolidated financial statements included herein. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business." In the third quarter of 2006, we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy Ltd., ("Verigy"). Verigy was a majority-owned subsidiary of Agilent until the distribution of our remaining Verigy shares to Agilent stockholders on October 31, 2006. The results of operations and financial position of Verigy are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent and reported as discontinued operations. See Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business." Basis of presentation. 
The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. 
Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and has full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. 
Reclassifications. 
Amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended October 31, 2005 and October 31, 2004 were reclassified to conform to the presentation used in 2006. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business," Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business" and Note 7, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds" for a discussion relating to these reclassifications. 
Principles of consolidation. 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Partially owned, non-controlled equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method. 
Use of estimates. 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events 63 and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, restructuring and asset impairment charges, share-based compensation, inventory valuation, investment impairments, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes. 
Revenue recognition. 
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. 
We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. We consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable, and accordingly we defer revenue until amounts become due. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. 
Product revenue. 
Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment. Software is embedded in many of our test equipment products, but the software component is generally considered to be incidental. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns, when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. 
Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence. 
Service revenue. 
Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer support, consulting, training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized. 
Multiple element arrangements. 
We use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If the criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until 64 such criteria are met or until the period(s) over which the last undelivered element is delivered. In the absence of objective evidence of fair value of a delivered element, we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. The price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value. 
Deferred revenue. 
Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of advanced billing and customer deposits for service, support and maintenance agreements. 
Accounts receivable, net. 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns. 
Share-based compensation. 
For the year ended 2006, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting in accordance with SFAS, No.123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123 (R)"), which was effective November 1, 2005 for Agilent. Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations for share-based awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for proforma disclosure under SFAS No. 123 were in effect for expense recognition purposes. Additionally, we recorded compensation expense using the fair value method for all share-based awards granted after November 1, 2005. We recorded SFAS No. 123 (R) compensation expense in continuing operations of $94 million in 2006. See Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements", for new accounting pronouncements affecting share-based awards beginning November 1, 2005. 
Through year end 2005, we accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"). Under the intrinsic value method, we recorded compensation expense related to stock options in our consolidated statement of operations when the exercise price of our employee share-based award was less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. Compensation expense was also recorded for the LTPP using the variable accounting method. We recorded APB No. 25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8 million in 2005 and $7 million in 2004. The APB No. 25 compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 primarily related to our LTPP. We issue new shares for award exercises. 
Inventory. 
Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. 
65 Taxes on income. 
Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. 
Warranty. 
Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery, but our current reserve balance includes three year agreements from prior periods. We accrue for standard warranty costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" ("SFAS No. 5"), based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of gross product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 17, "Guarantees". 
Shipping and handling costs. 
Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented. 
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets. 
Our accounting complies with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years. 
Advertising. 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $44 million in 2006, $33 million in 2005 and $46 million in 2004 for Agilent continuing operations. 
Research and development. 
Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred. 
Sales Taxes. 
Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue. 
Net income (loss) per share. 
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. In computing diluted net income (loss) per share under the treasury stock method, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds of stock option exercises. For fiscal year 2006 the number of shares assumed to be purchased also considered the amount of unrecognized compensation cost for future service as required under SFAS No. 123(R). Diluted net income per share for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 excluded the potentially dilutive effect of 8 million, 49 million and 41 million options to purchase common stock, respectively, as their effect was antidilutive. Fiscal year 2004 also excluded shares issuable upon conversion of our then outstanding $1.15 billion senior convertible debenture as the effect was not dilutive for this period, using the if-converted method pursuant to SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share". Our convertible debt was redeemed as of September 9, 2005 and therefore no longer outstanding nor part of the computation in 2006. 
66 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
Approximately 20 percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S., and 60 percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. The remainder is held by other Agilent entities throughout the world. Approximately 8 percent of our overall cash and cash equivalents is maintained in demand deposit accounts with global financial institutions of high credit quality and is available to be used in paying and receiving activities. The remainder is invested in institutional money market funds, short-term bank time deposits and similar short duration instruments with fixed maturities from overnight to three months. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our surplus funds. We have not experienced any credit losses from cash investments. 
We classify investments as short-term investments if their original or remaining maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Our short-term investments consist of bank time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to maturity, and are classified as such because we have the intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. 
Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $1.6 billion in 2006, $22 million in 2005 and zero in 2004. 
Fair value of financial instruments. 
The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities where available. 
Concentration of credit risk. 
We sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the combined accounts receivable balance at October 31, 2006 or 2005. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. 
Derivative instruments. 
Agilent is exposed to global market exchange rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options, to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures, which include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, which has the exposure. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To achieve hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
67 The derivatives entered into by Agilent are designated either as cash flow or fair value hedges. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in income in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. These amounts are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Fair value hedges are recorded in net income and are offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was not significant. 
We may also, from time to time, acquire warrants or other equity types of securities to purchase securities of other companies as part of strategic relationships. 
Property, plant and equipment. 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We are currently using the straight-line method to depreciate assets. 
Leases. 
We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from 1 to 20 years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to 20 years. These operating leases are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." Capitalized software. 
We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years when development is complete. 
Impairment of long-lived assets. 
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. 
Employee compensation and benefits Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $133 million as of October 31, 2006 and $145 million as of October 31, 2005. 
68 Foreign currency translation. 
We follow SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation", for both the translation and remeasurement of balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates; revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. 
For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for nonmonetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income (loss). 
2. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123 (R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair value for all share-based payment awards including stock options, employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans, non-vested share awards (restricted stock) and stock appreciation rights. SFAS No. 123 (R) supersedes our previous accounting under APB No. 25. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107, which provides the Staff's views regarding implementation issues related to SFAS No. 123 (R). 
We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) using the modified prospective transition method beginning November 1, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006. In accordance with that transition method, we have not restated prior periods for the effect of compensation expense calculated under SFAS No. 123 (R). We have selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all our awards, except for the non-vested performance shares under the LTPP. For the LTPP, we are using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate grant date fair value as required by SFAS No. 123 (R). Compensation expense for all share-based equity awards issued after November 1, 2005 is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. For awards issued prior to November 1, 2005, we are recognizing compensation expense based on the accelerated method described in FASB Interpretation No. 28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans" ("FIN No. 28"). The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) also requires additional accounting related to income taxes and earnings per share as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from share-based compensation. The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2006, and is expected to continue to materially impact our financial statements in the foreseeable future. See Note 5, "Share-Based Compensation" for more information on the impact of the new standard. 
In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") SFAS No. 123 (R)-3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards," ("FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3"). FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3 provides a practical exception when a company transitions to the accounting requirements in SFAS No. 123 (R). SFAS No. 123 (R) requires a company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting SFAS No. 123 (R) (termed the APIC Pool), assuming the company had been following the recognition provisions prescribed by SFAS No. 123. We have elected to use the guidance in FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3 69 to calculate our APIC Pool. FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3 was effective immediately. The adoption of the FSP did not have an impact on our overall results of operations or financial position. 
In June 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 06-3, "How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)," ("EITF No. 06-3"). EITF No. 06-3 requires disclosure of accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of point-of-sales taxes such as sales tax and value-added tax. If taxes included in gross revenues are significant, the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented should also be disclosed. EITF No. 06-3 will be effective for the first annual or interim reporting period after December 15, 2006. EITF No. 06-3 requires retrospective application. We will be adopting this pronouncement beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, and we do not expect it to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties" ("FIN No. 48"). FIN No. 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the taxing authority and provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN No. 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN No. 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 48 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards (except for measurements of share-based payments) and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively with some exceptions that will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS No. 158"), which requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets. Except for the measurement date requirement, SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The measurement date requirement will not be effective until fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 158 will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 on our consolidated financial position. 
70 In September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB No. 108"). SAB No. 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year's financial statements are materially misstated. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006 with earlier adoption encouraged and will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of SAB No. 108 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
3. Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business On December 1, 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago Technologies Ltd. ("Avago"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA"), Agilent received approximately $2,559 million in cash proceeds. The following table shows the components of the gain from sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes as of October 31, 2006: Subsequent to the quarter ended January 31, 2006, we adjusted the gain on sale of discontinued operations by $23 million which includes $21 million for working capital and other adjustments and $2 million for the disposal of fixed assets. The $36 million costs of disposition are reported net of a gain of $51 million for pension curtailments and settlements. The tax impact of the sale of our semiconductor products business reflects the utilization of the valuation allowance within the U.S. and a low effective tax rate in other jurisdictions. 
Our consolidated financial statements reflect our semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." 71 The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business for the periods ended October 31 included in the consolidated statement of operations: The following table presents Agilent's semiconductor products business assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations: 72 The following table presents Agilent's semiconductor products business's book value of net assets disposed of as of November 30, 2005: In accordance with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and other Intangibles" ("SFAS No. 142"), approximately $98 million of goodwill associated with the semiconductor products business was eliminated and recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale of discontinued operations. 
Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago are generally limited to 10 percent of the purchase price and survive until March 31, 2007. 
4. Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business On August 15, 2005, Agilent announced its intention to separate its semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy, into a stand-alone publicly traded company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7 million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds of $121 million. As part of the offering, Agilent made a payment to 73 Verigy of $19 million, the amount by which the net IPO proceeds were insufficient to complete the agreed-upon Verigy initial capitalization of $140 million. Following the offering, Agilent owned approximately 50 million shares or 85 percent of Verigy's ordinary shares. As a result of the IPO, Agilent recorded additional paid-in capital of $74 million related to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares sold. Underwriter fees related to the IPO were approximately $9 million which were netted against the proceeds. Agilent recorded direct IPO costs of $2 million within operating expenses related to third-party legal fees, filing fees and other services. 
On October 31, 2006, Agilent completed the spin-off of Verigy by distributing its remaining 85 percent equity interest in Verigy to Agilent stockholders. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend to Agilent stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by $310 million. In the distribution, Agilent distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of close of market on October 16, 2006. In the aggregate, Agilent distributed 50 million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent stockholders. Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 31, 2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value of the shares distributed in the distribution was approximately $840 million. The historical results of Verigy have been reflected as discontinued operations in the underlying financial statements and related disclosures for all periods presented. 
The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business for the presented periods ended October 31 included in the consolidated statement of operations: 74 The following table presents Agilent's semiconductor test solutions business assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations as of October 31, 2005: 75 The following table presents Agilent's book value of net assets eliminated due to the distribution as of October 31, 2006: Prior to the distribution of Verigy shares, Verigy and Agilent, and, in some cases, their respective subsidiaries, entered into agreements providing for the June 1, 2006 separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent, including a master separation and distribution agreement. These agreements cover a variety of matters, including the transfer, ownership and licensing of intellectual property and other assets and liabilities relating to Verigy's businesses, the use of shared facilities, employee and tax-related matters and the transitional services Agilent will provide to Verigy. In addition, an ancillary agreement provided for a $25 million revolving credit facility from Agilent to Verigy on the separation date with interest at one-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points. All amounts were repaid back and the credit facility has expired. The agreements relating to the separation from Agilent have been negotiated in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship. Per the transitional services agreement, the majority of the services Agilent provided to Verigy upon separation terminated prior to the distribution date. 
Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might 76 arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June 1, 2006. 
5. Share-Based Compensation Effective November 1, 2005, Agilent adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. Agilent previously applied the provisions of APB No. 25 and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No. 123"). 
Description of Share-Based Plans Employee stock purchase plans. 
Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. Under the provisions of the ESPP, eligible employees may contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the entry date or the purchase date as defined by the ESPP. The ESPP has a maximum contractual term of two years. As of October 31, 2006, securities authorized and available for issuance in connection with our ESPP were 23,341,919. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding common stock of Agilent or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP exceed 75 million shares. 
Incentive compensation plans. 
On September 17, 1999, we adopted the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan (the "Stock Plan") and subsequently reserved 67,800,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the Stock Plan. In addition, on May 31, 2000, 19,000,000 shares of our common stock were registered pursuant to converted stock options previously granted by HP. In February 2001, our stockholders approved an additional 45,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the Stock Plan. These shares were subsequently registered in May 2002. At October 31, 2006, shares registered and available for option and restricted stock grants were 36,639,572. 
Stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash awards may be granted under the Stock Plan. Options granted under the Stock Plan may be either "incentive stock options", as defined in section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant and generally have a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. 
On March 4, 2003, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock Plan. The amendment permitted the company to offer a one-time exchange of options issued under the Stock Plan having an exercise price greater than $25 for a lesser number of options to be granted at least six months and one day from the cancellation of surrendered options (the "Option Exchange Program"). On May 20, 2003, we implemented the Option Exchange Program by filing a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC, which 77 allowed eligible employees a one-time opportunity to exchange options to purchase shares of the company's common stock, whether vested or unvested, which were granted under our Stock Plan, with exercise prices greater than $25 per share. The Option Exchange Program was offered from May 20, 2003 to June 18, 2003 and options to purchase approximately 26 million shares were exchanged, with an average exercise price of $51. As a result, the company issued options to purchase approximately 13.8 million shares at a weighted-average exercise price of $28 per share during the first quarter of 2004. Under the provisions of APB No. 25 no compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for issuance of the replacement options for fiscal years ended 2005 and 2004. As a result of the SFAS No. 123 (R) adoption, in fiscal year ended 2006, we recognized approximately $3 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the issuance of these replacement options. 
Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP for the company's executive officers and other key employees beginning in 2006. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP plan is three years. The following table summarizes the shares approved by the Compensation Committee to be issued under the LTPP: In all cases, the final award may vary as it is based on certain performance metrics. We consider the dilutive impact of this program in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are met. 
Pro forma Information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), Agilent provided the disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosures." No employee share-based compensation expense was reflected in our results from continuing operations in 2005 and 2004 for employee stock option awards as all options were granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Our ESPP was deemed non-compensatory under the provisions of APB No. 25. Compensation expense for the non-vested performance shares granted under the LTPP was recognized based on the grant date fair value for the respective grants. Forfeitures of awards were recognized as they occurred. We recorded APB No. 25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8 million in 2005 and $7 million in 2004. The APB No. 25 compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 primarily related to our LTPP. In August 2005 our Board of Directors approved a modification to the terms of the options held by employees of our semiconductor products business to effect the acceleration of vesting for all unvested options held by employees of that business, effective as of the date of the sale of the semiconductor products business to Avago. In connection with this modification, we recorded $8 million of compensation expense in discontinued operations. 
78 The pro forma information for share-based compensation in 2005 and 2004 was as follows: The pro forma results in 2005 and 2004 include approximately $32 million and $70 million of pro forma compensation expense relating to our Option Exchange Program, respectively. The remainder of the expense for those periods related to awards granted over the previous four years. 
Due to the valuation allowance provided on our net deferred tax assets as described in Note 8, "Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations", we did not record any tax benefits attributable to pro forma share-based compensation expenses for employees in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions in 2005 and 2004. The tax impact presented above was computed for both the APB No. 25 and SFAS No. 123 share-based compensation expense. 
Impact of SFAS No. 123 (R) Agilent adopted SFAS No. 123 (R) using the modified prospective transition method beginning November 1, 2005. Accordingly, in 2006, we recorded share-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123 were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The effect of forfeitures on the unamortized compensation expense of pre-adoption awards was not material. For these awards, we have continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method under FIN No. 28. For share-based awards granted after November 1, 2005 we have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under SFAS No. 123 (R). For these awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As SFAS No. 123 (R) requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation in 2006 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Amounts previously reported prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) have not been restated. 
79 The impact on our results for share-based compensation in 2006 was as follows: At October 31, 2006 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory as it was immaterial. Total income tax benefit recognized in 2006 in the statement of operations for share-based compensation was immaterial. The weighted average grant date fair value of options, as determined under SFAS No. 123 (R), granted in 2006 was $10.46 per share. The total fair value of shares vested in 2006 was $216 million. In 2006 the windfall tax benefit realized from exercised stock options and similar awards was immaterial. As of October 31, 2006, the total unrecorded deferred share-based compensation balance for non-vested shares, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately $88 million which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. 
Included in income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) for the fiscal year ended 2006 is approximately $3 million of share-based compensation expense in connection with the 2005 modification to the terms of the options held by employees of our divested semiconductor products business. 
80 Included in income from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) is $9 million of share-based compensation expense for Agilent options held by Verigy employees and $2 million of new Verigy awards that were issued prior to the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent. As a result of the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent which took place on October 31, 2006, non-vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees were cancelled. Vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees will have a period of up to three months in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. Retirement eligible Verigy employees will have a period of up to three years in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. To the extent that the Agilent options were not vested as of the distribution date, Verigy issued replacement Verigy awards. 
Valuation Assumptions For all periods presented, the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards, restricted stock and employee stock purchases made under our ESPP was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In 2006, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. In 2005 and 2004, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using the variable accounting method under APB No. 25. 
The weighted average assumptions used for options granted, ESPP purchases and the LTPP in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows: 81 Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Beginning November 1, 2005, the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility for our stock. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving our expected volatility assumption. We have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility. We consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe are representative of future behavior. 
Share-Based Payment Award Activity The following table summarizes equity share-based payment award activity in 2006: 82 The plan shares expired per the above table represent cancelled options granted under the HP stock option plan that are not added back to our available for grant options as the plan shares expire after cancellation and are not reissuable. 
Forfeited and expired options in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: The options outstanding exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October 31, 2006 were as follows: The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $35.60 at October 31, 2006, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date. The total number of in-the-money awards exercisable at October 31, 2006 was approximately 33 million. 
83 The following table summarizes options exercised and the weighted average fair value of options granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004: The amount of cash received from the exercise of share-based awards granted was $547 million in 2006, $198 million in 2005 and $137 million in 2004. See Note 8, "Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations" for the tax impact on share-based award exercises. 
6. Other Income (Expense), Net The following table presents the components of other income (expense), net in 2006, 2005 and 2004: Interest income is derived principally from short-term commercial paper for our restricted investments and the investment of our surplus cash balances in bank time deposits and other money market instruments. Income from Foreign Sales Corporation Tax Study was earned pursuant to an agreement with Hewlett-Packard to provide assistance with a Foreign Sales Corporation Maximization 84 Study for years prior to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard. For its services, Agilent earned a fee which was contingent on related tax benefits being realized. 
7. Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. ("Lumileds"), was a global joint venture between Agilent and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ("Philips") under a Second Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture Agreement"), dated as of November 29, 2004, between Agilent and Philips. Lumileds manufactures high-power light emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Our ownership interest in Lumileds was approximately 47 percent as of October 31, 2005, after selling 1 percent of our interest to Philips in the second quarter of 2005. Our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in Lumileds was $901 million in 2006, $42 million in 2005 and $29 million in 2004. 
On November 28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, upon closure of the sale transaction, the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated. The purchase price paid by Philips under the Share Purchase Agreement was $949 million. In addition, Lumileds repaid the $51 million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest due to us as of the date of sale under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2001. 
The following table shows the components of the gain from sale of Lumileds, net of income tax (in millions): The tax impact of the sale of our Lumileds joint venture primarily reflects the utilization of valuation allowances within the U.S. 
85 8. Provision (Benefit) For Income Taxes From Continuing Operations The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations is comprised of: The federal and state provisions do not reflect tax savings resulting from deductions associated with our stock option plans. 
The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: 86 The consolidated balance sheet reflects the allocation of the valuation allowance based on the pro-rata portion of gross current and non-current deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction where a valuation allowance is required. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence to require full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. 
At October 31, 2006, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $256 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $145 million. The federal net operating losses expire in years beginning 2007 through 2021, if not utilized. The federal tax credits expire beginning in 2007 through 2026, if not utilized. In addition, the company has state tax credit carryforwards of $133 million. State tax credits of $18 million expire beginning in 2007 through 2018, if not utilized. A portion of the federal and state net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. These annual loss limitations may result in the expiration or reduced utilization of the net operating losses and/or credits. At October 31, 2006, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $390 million. Of this foreign loss, $127 million will expire in years beginning 2011 through 2014, if not utilized. The remaining $263 million has an indefinite life. Some of the foreign losses are subject to annual loss limitation rules. 
Net deferred tax assets of approximately $79 million at October 31, 2006 and approximately $32 million at October 31, 2005 pertain to net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. When recognized, the reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision. 
The differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective tax rate from continuing operations are: 87 The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) earnings from continuing operations before taxes are: The income tax provision for 2006 includes a benefit of $29 million related to the resolution of domestic tax-related issues for years covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The Tax Sharing Agreement is related to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard. 
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and reported an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970 million and a related tax liability of approximately $48 million in our fiscal 2005 federal and state income tax returns. For fiscal 2005, $23 million of the $48 million is provided for in the discontinuing operations' provision for income taxes while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations' provision for income taxes. 
Agilent has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our policy is to continue to invest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the United States, with the exception of the amounts repatriated in the year ended October 31, 2005 under the AJCA. If management decides to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period. 
Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. During the years 2003 through 2006, Agilent enjoyed tax holidays that applied to manufacturing income generated in Malaysia and Singapore. The tax holidays in both Malaysia and Singapore expire in 2013. In 2004, Agilent secured a reduced tax rate in Switzerland for income generated from activity that Agilent began in Switzerland during that year. The tax holiday expires in 2013. Also in 2004, Agilent secured an additional Singapore tax holiday for earnings from investments and related activity that began in 2004. The tax holiday applies to applicable earnings of Agilent until the end of 2013, with the opportunity for a reduced rate thereafter. 
As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $76 million, $54 million and $96 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.17, $0.11 and $0.20 in 2006, 2005 and 2003, respectively. 
88 We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. 
9. Net Income (Loss) Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations for the periods presented below. 
In computing diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method, we elected to use the transition election of FSP SFAS No. 123 (R)-3 to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits as of the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R). For further details see Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements." The total number of awards exercised in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 19 million, 5 million and 3 million, respectively. 
In connection with the October 31, 2006 Verigy distribution, on November 1, 2006 Agilent distributed .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of October 16, 2006 to Agilent's stockholders. In addition, under the anti-dilution provision of the 1999 Stock Plan, on November 1, 2006 Agilent adjusted the exercise price downward and number of option shares upward for each outstanding employee stock option to preserve the value of the options after the Verigy spin-off. For further details on the distribution see Note 5, "Share-Based Compensation." 89 The following table presents options to purchase shares of common stock, which were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because they were anti-dilutive. 
The computation of diluted net income per share for the fiscal year 2004 does not include 36 million shares issuable upon conversion of our then outstanding $1.15 billion senior convertible debenture as the effect was not dilutive for this period, using the if-converted method pursuant to SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share". Our convertible debt was redeemed as of September 9, 2005 and therefore not part of the computation in 2006. 
10. Supplemental Cash Flow Information Cash paid for income taxes was $156 million in 2006, $75 million in 2005 and $149 million in 2004. Cash paid for interest was $55 million in 2006, $44 million in 2005 and $36 million in 2004. In 2006, we spent $25 million as debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt of $1.5 billion and amortized $4 million in interest expense during 2006. 
Non cash transactions in 2005 primarily related to the conversion of approximately $466 million of the principal amount of convertible debt into common stock. In addition, accrued interest of approximately $4 million relating to the convertible debt was recorded in equity as part of the cost of the new shares issued. Non-cash transactions in 2004 related primarily to an acquisition in October 2004 and we issued approximately 772,000 shares with an approximate value of $18 million. 
11. Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents As of October 31, 2006, $1,606 million was reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. Of this amount, $1,582 million was short-term restricted commercial paper maintained in connection with our obligations to a counterparty pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation entered into on January 27, 2006 and reported as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 21, "Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities." 12. Inventory 90 Inventory-related charges of $38 million, $59 million and $16 million were recorded in total cost of products in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record excess and obsolete inventory charges for both inventory on our site as well as inventory at our contract manufacturers and suppliers where we have non-cancelable purchase commitments. 
13. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net We sold our San Jose site for a total consideration of $88 million and recorded a gain of $56 million during the second quarter of 2006. In May 2006, we completed the sale of our Palo Alto site for a total consideration of $98.5 million and recorded a gain of $65 million. Asset impairments other than restructuring were zero in 2006, $4 million in 2005, and zero in 2004. Depreciation expenses for continuing operations were $141 million in 2006, $163 million in 2005 and $189 million in 2004. 
14. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The goodwill balances at October 31, 2006 and 2005 and the movements in 2006 and 2005 for each of our reportable segments are shown in the table below: 91 The component parts of other intangibles assets at October 31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in the table below: We purchased $69 million of other intangibles and recorded $76 million of goodwill during 2006. 
In February 2006, we acquired the remaining 49 percent minority interest in Yokogawa Analytical Systems, a joint venture between Agilent and Yokogawa Electrical Corporation. This acquisition resulted in the recording of $43 million in intangible assets and $60 million of goodwill. In addition, during 2006 we recorded two acquisitions, one earn out payment on an acquisition completed in 2005, and one joint venture buyout payment. Pro forma disclosures are not presented for these transactions as they were not material. 
Amortization of intangible assets was $24 million in 2006, $13 million in 2005 and $17 million in 2004. Future amortization expense related to existing intangible assets is estimated to be $27 million in 2007, $19 million in 2008, $12 million in 2009, $10 million in 2010, $7 million in 2011 and $8 million thereafter. 
15. Investments Investments in cost basis and equity method investments and securities classified as trading securities or available-for-sale and included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet were as follows at October 31, 2006 and 2005 (net book value): 92 Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and are accounted for at historical cost. For investments where we have significant influence over the investee, the equity method of accounting is used. Agilent's proportionate share of income or loss for equity method investments was recorded currently in earnings. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in operating earnings. Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity. 
All of our investments (excluding trading securities) are subject to periodic impairment review. However, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. 
Charges related to other than temporary impairments were $1 million in 2006, $18 million in 2005 and $15 million in 2004. These impairment charges were recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. 
Unrealized gains and losses on our trading securities portfolio were $6 million gain in 2006 and $5 million gain in both 2005 and 2004. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities was $9 million in 2006, $8 million in 2005 and zero in 2004. Realized gains and losses from the sale of held-to-maturity securities was $2 million in 2006, zero in 2005 and zero in 2004. 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we sold our remaining interest in Lumileds to Philips. See Note 7, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds "for further details. 
16. Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans General. 
Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits and a death benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan for our eligible U.S. employees. 
Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the retirement and deferred profit-sharing plans, defined benefits which are generally based on an employee's highest five consecutive years' average pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under our defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. 
As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of plan assets and the total projected benefit obligation of the DPSP for U.S. Agilent Employees were $726 million and $826 million, respectively. 
Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. Our U.S. retirees who retired prior to January 1, 2005, are also covered by a lump sum death benefit that is part of the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan. In July 2004, the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan was revised to eliminate the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit for all U.S. retirees who retire on or after January 1, 2005. 
93 401(k) defined contribution plan. 
Our U.S. eligible employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Enrollment in the 401(k) Plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. Under the 401(k) Plan, we provide matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 4 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation. The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory and plan limitations. The 401(k) Plan expense included in income (loss) from continuing operations was $26 million in 2006, $25 million in 2005 and $25 million in 2004. 
Post-retirement medical benefit plans. 
In addition to receiving pension benefits, our U.S. employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in our Non-Medicare Medical or Medicare Medical Plans (the "Post-retirement Medical Plans") under the Agilent Health Plan. Current U.S. employees may become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. Once participating in a medical plan, retirees may choose from managed-care and indemnity options, with their contributions dependent on the options chosen and length of service. 
Plan amendments. 
In July 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved design changes to Agilent's Post-retirement Medical Plans. One option available to existing post-65 retirees is a new Medicare Supplement Plan in 2005. The Medicare Supplement Plan supplements Medicare coverage by reimbursing Medicare Parts A and B deductibles at 100 percent after Medicare pays its portion of the retiree's expenses. The Post-retirement Medical Plan for a majority of future retirees was revised to establish retiree medical accounts for the benefit of such retirees and will be funded with amounts as determined by Agilent. 
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. 
In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was passed which expands Medicare to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003", which provides guidance on how companies should account for the impact of the Act on its postretirement healthcare plans. Beginning in 2006, the federal government provides a non-taxable subsidy to employers that sponsor prescription drug benefits to retirees that are "actuarially equivalent" to Medicare Part D benefits. We have determined that the prescription drug benefits offered under our plans qualify for this subsidy and assuming that we will continue to offer these benefits, we have reflected the expected subsidy according to the guidance in FSP 106-2 prospectively in our financial statements. The adoption of FSP 106-2 had no material impact on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net plan costs. 
94 Components of net periodic cost. 
For the years ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our net pension and post-retirement benefit costs were comprised of: As of December 1, 2005, due to the divestiture of the semiconductor products business, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," ("SFAS No. 88") and as required under the SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("SFAS No. 106"). The impact to the U.S. Plans and the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan was curtailment gains of $22 million and $21 million, recorded in discontinued operations. The impact on the Non-U.S. Plans was a settlement gain of $8 million recorded in discontinued operations. 
Due to the separation of our semiconductor test solutions business into a separate legal company, Verigy, as of June 1, 2006, and due to significant workforce reductions, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No. 88 and SFAS No. 106 in the third quarter. The impact to the U.S. Plans was a curtailment gain of $12 million consisting of curtailment gain of $3 million for continuing operations and curtailment gain of $9 million for discontinued operations as well as a $4 million settlement gain relating to continuing operations. The impact to the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan was a curtailment gain of $12 million for continuing operations. The impact to the Non-U.S. Plans was a curtailment loss of $1 million and a settlement gain of $4 million, that were recorded in discontinued operations. 
In the U.S., because of additional workforce reductions along with cessation of retiree medical benefits for Verigy employees as of October 31, 2006, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No. 88 and SFAS No. 106 in the fourth quarter. The impact to the U.S. Plans was 95 curtailment gains of $2 million and a settlement gain of $2 million both of which were for continuing operations. For the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan, we recorded a curtailment gain of $5 million which was for discontinued operations. 
Funded status. 
As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: 96 Investment policies and strategies as of October 31, 2005 and 2006. 
Plan assets consist primarily of publicly-traded stocks and bonds. In the U.S., our Agilent Retirement Plan and post-retirement benefit assets are allocated approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP assets are allocated approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 10 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of alternative investments, largely private equity partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. The safety and protection of principal is a primary concern, and we believe that a well-diversified investment portfolio will result in the highest attainable investment return (income plus capital appreciation) with the lowest overall risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our assets are allocated from 50 to 70 percent to equities, from 25 to 50 percent to fixed income investments, and from 0 to 5 percent to real estate investments, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. The actual allocations of plan assets are consistent with the target allocations. 
The table below presents the projected benefit obligation ("PBO"), accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") and fair value of plan assets in the aggregate for all plans, separately showing those that were considered under-funded as of October 31, 2006 or 2005. 
97 Additional Minimum Liability. 
An additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2005 for three pension plans in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated comprehensive loss was $170 million, which was partially offset by $20 million applied to deferred tax assets, net of tax valuation allowance. The large impact on accumulated comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions", for the impacted countries. 
On June 1, 2006, in accordance with the separation agreement between Agilent and Verigy, the liability for certain Verigy employee pension benefits was transferred to separate Verigy pension plans. Agilent funded the pension liability to the extent of the accumulated benefit obligation out of operating cash. The funded status of the Non-U.S. plans required us to reverse $58 million of the additional minimum liability along with the related deferred tax impacts, of approximately $20 million. 
An additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2006 for two pension plans in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated comprehensive gain (loss) was $112 million which was partially offset by $34 million applied to deferred tax assets. The large impact on accumulated comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions", for the impacted countries. 
Contributions and estimated future benefit payments. 
During fiscal year 2007, we expect to contribute zero to the U.S. defined benefit plans, $39 million to plans outside the U.S., and zero to the 98 Post-retirement Medical Plans. The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years: Assumptions. 
The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the table below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based, on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans October 31 for the U.S. plans and September 30 for the non-U.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against the cash flows from a hypothetically constructed portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as a proxy for setting the discount rate. The non-U.S. rates were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries. 
99 Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation and the resulting additional minimum pension liability were as follows: 100 Assumed health care trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Post-retirement Medical Plans. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates for the year ended October 31, 2006 would have the following effects: 17. Guarantees Standard Warranty A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity in 2006 and 2005 is shown in the table below. 
Extended Warranty Revenue from our extended warranty contracts with terms beyond one year is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. Amounts representing warranty contracts for the next twelve months are included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and were $43 million and $26 million at October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively. The long-term amounts are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and were $55 million and $50 million at October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively. Also see Note 20, "Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities." 101 Lease Guarantees During the quarter ended April 30, 2005 we entered into an amended Vendor Finance agreement with CIT Group Inc. (formerly Tyco Capital Corporation) that released Agilent from substantially all credit guarantees. As part of this agreement Agilent was also released of liability relating to the guarantees that could require us to repurchase individual leases if the documentation we provided to support the lease was not materially accurate. The impact of the agreement was not material. 
Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago are generally limited to 10 percent of the purchase price and survive until March 31, 2007. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2006. 
Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against certain damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June 1, 2006. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2006. 
Indemnifications to Hewlett-Packard We have given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP for the businesses that constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. These indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property and environmental matters. The agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on Form S-1 filed on August 16, 1999. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2006. 
Indemnifications to Officers and Directors Our corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the 102 claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these obligations was zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2006. 
Other Indemnifications As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2006. 
18. Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Commitments: We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases related to continuing operations at October 31, 2006 were $79 million for 2007, $62 million for 2008, $44 million for 2009, $25 million for 2010, $16 million for 2011 and $37 million thereafter. Future minimum sublease income under leases at October 31, 2006 was $12 million for 2007, $10 million for 2008, $6 million for 2009, $2 million for 2010 and zero for 2011. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense, including amounts recorded in discontinued operations, was $112 million in 2006, $90 million in 2005 and $116 million in 2004. Rent expense recorded in discontinued operations was $2 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and $25 million in 2004. 
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including patent, commercial and environmental matters. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
19. Restructuring and Asset Impairment We initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods: the 2001 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan ("Prior Plans"). The workforce reduction portion of the Prior Plans was completed during fiscal year 2005. The consolidation of excess facilities portion of Prior Plans is expected to be completed within approximately the next five years. In addition, there may be future changes in estimates for the consolidation of excess facilities related to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the time the charges were recorded. 
103 In the fourth quarter of 2005, as a consequence of the decision to divest the semiconductor products and semiconductor test solutions businesses, we launched a new restructuring program (the "2005 Plan") to align our workforce with our smaller organizational size. The 2005 Plan consists purely of workforce reduction initiatives, and is primarily focused on reducing the costs associated with the shared services functions. 
A summary of total restructuring activity, including that classified as discontinued operations, is shown in the table below: The restructuring accrual for all plans, which totaled $71 million at October 31, 2006 and $93 million at October 31, 2005, is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and represents estimated future cash outlays. Workforce reduction expenses, primarily severance, are expected to be largely completed by the end of fiscal 2007. In 2006, we consolidated several facilities due to changes in our organizational structure and recorded impairment charges of $42 million. These charges were primarily associated with facilities located in Germany and the US. 
104 A summary of the statement of operations impact of the charges resulting from all restructuring plans is shown below: 20. Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities Other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities at October 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: 105 Amounts owed to our employees for accrued vacation totaled $133 million and $145 million at October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is recorded in employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheet. 
21. Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities In January 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc., a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent ("World Trade"), entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with a third party pursuant to which World Trade sold 15,000 Class A preferred shares of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the third party those preferred shares for 100 percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January 2011. The $1.5 billion obligation of our subsidiary to repurchase the preferred shares has been classified as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The related debt issuance costs of $25 million were deferred and recognized in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. These costs will be amortized over the life of the Repurchase Agreement. 
Under the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the third party at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 28 basis points. Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the third party the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade. The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default but no financial covenants. Under the Repurchase Agreement, our subsidiary has the right to accelerate the repurchase of all or any portion of the preferred shares prior to January 2011. 
In connection with the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade's wholly owned subsidiary is required to hold short-term investments. As of October 31, 2006, these investments were approximately $1,582 million and were classified within restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 11, "Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents." In December 2005, we drew down $700 million on a $1 billion senior secured term borrowing facility to help finance our share repurchase program. The term facility allowed us a one-time borrowing at an interest rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points per annum. In January 2006, we applied $700 million of the proceeds from the Repurchase Agreement to repay the full amount borrowed under the secured term borrowing facility. Total interest expense on the senior secured term borrowing facility was $3.6 million. The senior secured term borrowing facility expired in the first quarter of 2006. 
22. Stock Repurchase Program During the fourth quarter of 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $4.466 billion of our common stock. Under the program, we repurchased 8.9 million shares for $290 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
In the first quarter of 2006, under a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer, we agreed to accept for payment 83 million shares at a purchase price of $36 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $3 billion. In June 2006, we completed our stock repurchase program which was announced in fourth quarter of 2005. Under the program, we repurchased a total of approximately 125 million shares of our common stock for $4.466 billion. In addition, we capitalized $3 million of service and legal fees. 
106 During the fourth quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program of up to $2 billion of our common stock. Under the new program, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. 
As of October 31, 2006, we have repurchased approximately 127 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.5 billion. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. 
23. Segment Information Description of segments. 
We are a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. During 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business" and Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business" for further information. Following this reorganization, Agilent has two businesses bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement each of which comprises a reportable segment. The segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Other factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels, were also considered in determining our reportable segments. 
A description of our two remaining reportable segments is as follows: Bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our seven key product categories include microarrays, microfluidics, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, and related consumables, reagents and services; Electronic measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems, monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications networks and services, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle. 
Segment revenue and profit. 
The accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are generally the same as those described in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies". 
A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically managed centrally in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include costs of centralized research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to 107 the segments, and the allocations are determined on a basis that we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. After its separation on June 1, 2006, Agilent started billing our semiconductor test solutions business for their use of shared services under the transition services agreement. Corporate charges previously allocated to our semiconductor products business and semiconductor test systems business, but not classified within discontinued operations, were not reallocated to our other segments. These charges are presented below as a component of the reconciliation between the segments' income from operations and Agilent's income from continuing operations and are classified as unallocated semiconductor products business corporate charges and unallocated semiconductor test systems business corporate charges. 
The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. These results are not in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. For example, share-based compensation, restructuring, and other items are excluded from the segment measure of income (loss) from operations. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including adjusted income (loss) from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments. 
The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, amortization of goodwill, amortization and impairment of other intangibles and other items as noted in the reconciliation below. 
In 2005 and 2004, revenue classified as discontinued operations included an adjustment of $1 million and $2 million respectively that was previously allocated to our semiconductor test solution business. As a result, total reportable segment revenue was higher than Agilent net revenue by $1 million and $2 million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively. 
108 The following table reconciles segment results to Agilent's total enterprise results from continuing operations before taxes: Major customers. 
No customer represented 10 percent or more of our total net revenue in 2006, 2005 or 2004. 
Unallocated assets primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets and other assets. In 2006, we refined the methodology for allocating corporate assets, the largest component of which relates to deferred tax assets before the valuation adjustment. Also, in 2006, we disposed a portion of our equity investments and the remaining balance of $16 million was reclassified to available for sale securities. The following table reflects the updated measure of segment assets, capital expenditures and investments in equity-method investees directly managed by each segment. All historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
