In the fiscal year ended October 31, 1999, Hewlett-Packard accounted for 10% of our total net revenue. 

3 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) INDUSTRY OVERVIEW Many of the markets we serve are undergoing rapid change and experiencing significant growth. We believe that these trends will provide us with major growth opportunities. 

COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY The communications industry is undergoing fundamental change and growth resulting principally from explosive demand for Internet access and data transmission services. Traditional voice telecommunications have been carried as an electrical signal over copper wire. Since this technology was designed for low-capacity voice transmission, it is unable to meet the high-volume transmission requirements of Internet access and other forms of high-speed, digital data communications. Increased bandwidth is critically important to the transmission of high-volume data and is the driving force behind the deployment of the high-speed, high-capacity, digital network infrastructure. 

Fiber optic networks are increasingly replacing copper-based technologies in local area and wide area networks. Fiber optics enable digital information, such as coded data, voice or video, to be transmitted as pulses of light. The light being transmitted along each fiber-optic cable can be divided up into multiple frequencies, and each frequency can be used as a separate transmission path. 

Thus each fiber optic cable can simultaneously carry multiple transmissions. 

Other new communications technologies, such as Gigabit Ethernet, Digital Subscriber Line and Asynchronous Transfer Mode, are being deployed to expand the capabilities of existing networks or build new broadband data networks. Cable service providers are in the early stages of introducing broadband interactive data services and Internet access to their customers by redesigning their networks and deploying cable modem technologies. 

The usage levels of wireless communications around the world are increasing dramatically, as penetration increases in developed countries, and lesser-developed countries deploy wireless networks as a means to quickly address the surging demand for communications. As an alternative to wireline access, some carriers and service providers are utilizing wireless technologies to provide voice, data and Internet services to their customers. While broadband wireless data services are still in the early stages, the development and deployment of next generation cellular technologies and services is likely to lead to their rapid growth. 

We believe that these emerging trends in the communications industry provide us with a number of significant business opportunities. The widespread deployment of fiber optic networks generates increasing demand for high-speed optoelectronic components to connect the electronic systems controlling the network to the transmission fiber. The manufacture, physical installation and maintenance of network switches, routers and other high-speed devices rely on increasingly sophisticated testing, calibration and measurement instruments and systems. Additionally, these systems typically require physical layer integrated circuits to prepare data for transmission across high-speed networks, such as Gigabit Ethernet, Digital Subscriber Line, Asynchronous Transfer Mode and next- generation cable networks. Service providers face increased competition as a result of these emerging technologies and deregulation of the industry. 

Traditional communications service providers and emerging Internet service providers, competing aggressively for subscribers, require advanced test and monitoring solutions to optimize quality of service to their customers. 

Similarly, the manufacturers of cellular handsets, base stations and other wireless network equipment require advanced design software and test and measurement instruments and systems to develop, manufacture and deploy advanced wireless communications products and capture the high growth market opportunity. 

4 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) SEMICONDUCTOR AND ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES The semiconductor and electronics industries are still largely driven by rapid technological advancement, a phenomenon commonly known as Moore's Law, which states that the functionality and performance of a digital integrated circuit doubles roughly every 18-24 months. Decreased size and greater density of the individual electronic components on the integrated circuit drive improvements in the performance and functionality of the device and decrease price to the end user. This continuous cycle of increased performance at lower cost drives the pervasiveness of semiconductor devices in multiple applications, from communications networks to consumer products. At the same time, the cycle places increasing demands on companies that develop and use electronic components, products and systems to keep up with the fast pace of technological advances. 

The effect of Moore's Law creates major business opportunities for us. Each new integrated circuit design presents new challenges for test and measurement systems: smaller, more densely-packed elements; faster operating speeds; and greater complexity. Semiconductor devices and electronic components and assemblies comprise an increasing proportion of the overall value of end-products, increasing the importance of testing within the electronic component and systems design and manufacturing process. The increasing pervasiveness of semiconductor devices creates strong growth opportunities for many of our products, including our electronic and optical components, our high frequency and digital design solutions, as well as our automated test equipment used in high volume manufacturing settings. 

PHARMACEUTICAL, BIOSCIENCE AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES The time and expense required to discover and develop new drugs demand that pharmaceutical companies continually find ways to improve the efficiency of the drug-discovery process, often relying on analytical instruments to improve productivity while remaining compliant with laws and regulations. At the same time, the healthcare industry is seeking ways to reduce costs and improve the quality of health care. We believe this trend will require healthcare solutions that can be deployed in non-hospital settings, such as in smaller clinics and in patients' homes. Healthcare research and development institutions are also focusing increased resources on disease diagnosis and prevention. Greater understanding of the genetic basis of disease is considered critical to learning how to prevent, diagnose and manage diseases and requires advanced instrumentation for DNA and related analysis. 

STRATEGY FOCUS ON HIGH GROWTH MARKET OPPORTUNITIES Our strategy is to use our strengths as a diversified technology company to enter new markets through internal development, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. To achieve this objective, we work closely with our customers' research and development teams to understand emerging markets, technologies and standards and we invest accordingly in our own development of enabling solutions in those areas. We intend to use strategic partnerships and make tactical acquisitions to develop advanced systems that complement our existing technologies and products to accelerate our entry into strategic, high-growth markets. 

Within the communications markets, we are focused on providing test, measurement and monitoring technologies and solutions for the development and deployment of next-generation fiber optic, broadband, Internet and cellular networks, as well as leading edge fiber optic and semiconductor components. We work closely with cellular component and device manufacturers at the research and development stage to understand emerging industry standards. We have also continued to invest in our 5 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) market-leading high-frequency design solutions. We were able to take advantage of our product diversity by applying the technologies we developed for the defense industries in the 1980s to the higher growth communications industry when growth of the defense market slowed. In life sciences, we have focused our efforts on the high-growth segments of the pharmaceutical industry. In healthcare, we recently made an acquisition that accelerated our entry and gave us leading market share in the fast-growing automatic external defibrillator market. 

CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TECHNOLOGICALLY Agilent Technologies and Agilent Technologies Laboratories have a long legacy of technological innovation and product generation as part of Hewlett-Packard. We will continue to invest in and build research and development expertise, focusing our centralized laboratories on fundamental technology and process developments and utilizing innovations from our businesses to develop products to address high growth market segments.

MARKETS The market for our test and measurement products comprises three major customer groups: - communications network equipment manufacturers and service providers; - electronic component and equipment manufacturers; and - semiconductor manufacturers and purchasers of semiconductors. 

COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS Network equipment manufacturers provide products to facilitate the transmission of voice and data traffic. This transmission may be in various forms, such as electronic signals over copper wire, optical signals over fiber cables, and radio frequency or microwave signals. The customers of the network equipment manufacturers are the communications service providers that deploy and operate the networks. The communication service providers are facing increasing competitive pressures as a result of deregulation in the telecommunications industry and the rapid advances in transmission technology, including communications switching and routing. Communications service providers must provide high-quality, highly reliable service to remain competitive, maintain customer loyalty and meet the rapidly growing demand for data transmission and related services. As a result, these service providers require network equipment that enables their networks to operate at increasingly faster speeds while providing rapidly expanding capacity and superior reliability. To meet these demands, network component and equipment manufacturers require test and measurement instruments, systems and solutions for the development, production, installation and operation of each new network technology. These solutions include: - test instruments and systems for developing and manufacturing communications modules, assemblies and products; and - test instruments and systems to support the installation and deployment of network equipment and to validate the operational performance of the equipment in the network. 

Communications and Internet service providers also require a range of sophisticated test instruments and systems to evaluate network performance and to identify any sources of communications failure. Additionally, these customers require advanced software and systems to monitor and manage the network infrastructure on a continuous, proactive basis to achieve either regulated or customer-specified service levels. Real-time monitoring of the network infrastructure also enables the implementation of additional services, such as fraud detection, which customers increasingly require of service providers. Many corporations manage their own internal voice and data communications networks. 

As enterprises increasingly rely on these networks for critical applications, they also require advanced test and monitoring equipment, systems and software to optimize network performance. 

The market for cellular telephony has increased dramatically in recent years, as the levels of wireless penetration in developed countries have grown rapidly. Many lesser-developed countries have decided to build wireless communications infrastructure to meet their nations' needs for telephony, 8 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) rather than invest in expensive wire-based infrastructure. To develop cellular telephone equipment, manufacturers require electronic design software and test instruments and systems for the development of high-frequency communications circuits, devices and systems. Cellular equipment manufacturers also require advanced, high-frequency test instruments and systems to develop, manufacture and deploy cellular base stations for these wireless networks. In addition, the rapid growth of the cellular handset market has created a new market segment for automated test equipment to test cellular handsets on the factory floor. 

Further, as new standards evolve in the wireless industry, new test and measurement equipment and systems have to be developed to enable testing of the new standards in the research and development and later in the manufacturing and deployment phases. 

We believe that in the last several years, producers of networking communications equipment have increased their use of contract manufacturers to reduce cost, retain business flexibility and access high end or high volume manufacturing capabilities. Contract manufacturers require test solutions that are particularly well-suited for faster production and flexible for use in different applications. Recently, cellular phone producers have also begun to increasingly use contract manufacturers, including for functional test. This requires specialized test products and services to address the particular needs of these high-frequency products. 

ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS The electronics industry designs, develops, manufactures and distributes a wide range of products, including products produced in high volumes, such as computers, computer peripherals and consumer electronics. In addition, electronic components and printed circuit assemblies are incorporated into other products, such as aircraft, satellites and automobiles. These components and printed circuit assemblies may be designed, developed and manufactured by electronic components companies, by original equipment manufacturers or by third-party contract manufacturers. For the development and timely commercialization of new technologies, original equipment manufacturers require state-of-the-art test instruments, systems and software design tools in order to design the products for efficient and cost-effective manufacturing and validate product performance in a variety of configurations and environments. We believe that these demands have resulted in an increasing trend toward the use of contract manufacturers by electronics equipment manufacturers. 

Designers and developers of electronic devices and products require state-of-the-art digital design tools and instruments in order to build electronic circuits, components and products, to validate their performance and functionality and to improve the efficiency of the overall design and development process. 

High volume manufacturers of electronics products, such as printed circuit board assemblies, require sophisticated automated test equipment to operate and perform highly accurate tests at speeds and volumes matching those of the production line. This equipment includes in-circuit testing systems, automated x-ray inspection systems and automated optical inspection systems, all of which examine the printed circuit assemblies for manufacturing defects. Manufacturers are also beginning to demand automated functional test systems, which test an electronic device as if it were in its final environment. Functional test equipment must have a wide range of capabilities in order to simulate the functions of a wide variety of electronic devices such as personal computers, personal computer peripherals or automotive electronics. 

Electronics manufacturing also requires standardized test instruments, system components and complete solutions. These offerings are used for testing electronic devices in a broad range of applications, such as radar systems, electronics used in the operation of household appliances and industrial automation. Aerospace and defense are important markets for standardized electronic 9 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) equipment because of the high electronic content of advanced defense systems and defense-related communications and surveillance equipment. We believe that following recent reductions in defense spending, defense purchasers are shifting from specialized test equipment to off-the-shelf test products and systems. 

SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS Semiconductor test systems are used by semiconductor designers, semiconductor manufacturers and electronic component manufacturers in the design, manufacture and testing of a wide variety of semiconductor products, including logic, memory, mixed analog and digital signal, and system-on-a-chip integrated circuits. Semiconductor test systems are sold to semiconductor manufacturers and assembly and test subcontractors to the semiconductor industry. Semiconductor manufacturers use our semiconductor test systems to measure product performance, to confirm functionality, to improve product and production process quality, to shorten time to market, to enhance manufacturability, to reduce labor costs and to increase production yields. 

According to VLSI Research, the market for automatic test equipment for semiconductor manufacturing was approximately $3.3 billion in 1998 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 20% over the next five years. Demand for this test equipment is driven primarily by the increased volume of semiconductor devices produced. The use of semiconductors has proliferated across many industries, including communications, computing, and consumer electronics, driving up the overall production volume of semiconductor devices. Advances in semiconductor technology are also increasing demand for semiconductor test equipment. The development of increasingly faster and more complex semiconductor devices stimulates demand for testers capable of evaluating these high-speed devices. In addition, the continuing integration of functions, such as microprocessor, logic and memory, on a single integrated circuit has created a new category of device called system-on-a-chip. These devices require a new category of sophisticated and flexible automatic test equipment. 

STRATEGY Our test and measurement business pursues the following strategies to maintain and extend our global leadership position and to be the preferred supplier of enabling solutions for our customers: ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF HIGH GROWTH MARKETS Our test and measurement business is focused on addressing the needs of the communications and electronics industries. We believe these markets will provide significant growth opportunities as end-users' demands are driven by the rapid adoption of new technologies providing increased performance at lower cost. In communications markets, we address the needs of both network component and equipment manufacturers and network service providers, including fiber optic, Internet Protocol-based and cellular networks. As demand for greater communications capacity increases, network manufacturers must develop higher speed and higher capacity equipment. Similarly, network service providers must be able to expand and operate existing networks, as well as create and operate new networks, at high service levels. In the electronics industry, designers must develop next generation electronic devices and equipment rapidly and in a cost-effective manner. To keep pace with the speed of innovation in this market, manufacturers need to bring product to market faster and achieve high quality at high volume production levels. We have targeted our test and measurement business products and services to enable our customers in these high growth markets to achieve these goals. 

10 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) UTILIZE OUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ACROSS MULTIPLE CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS We design our products to be used in many phases of our customers' business--from design and development through installation and deployment. We invest heavily in the development of new test and measurement instruments, systems and design tools to meet the requirements of our most innovative customers. Our work with these customers in developing tools and test instruments targeted for the research and development labs provides us with valuable insight into emerging technologies and standards. Once we have developed a testing solution for what we anticipate will become a sizable market, we invest in further product development to market the solution to a broader customer base. Our initial solutions often combine several general purpose instruments with customized software applications. This approach enables us to move our solutions more easily from our customers' research and development laboratories to their manufacturing lines, allowing us to meet their manufacturing test needs in a timely manner. By working closely with our customers to understand the final application of their products, we are able to modify the software and hardware design of our solutions for use in the installation and deployment phase of their products. We believe that this strategy allows us to utilize fully our investments in these new technologies. 

MAINTAIN STRONG CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS TO ANTICIPATE IMPORTANT INDUSTRY TRENDS A central component of our strategy is to work closely with our customers in their product design stage to understand emerging technologies and applications and develop advanced test and measurement instruments, systems and solutions. We gather information from our customers so that we may design and create new instruments to test emerging technologies as they develop them. For example, as communications networks have been overwhelmed by demand for increased speed and capacity, we have focused our product development on the technologies to enable next-generation, high-speed networks. We provide advanced fiber optic network test instruments and solutions to service providers to maximize the performance and minimize the total cost of ownership of high-speed fiber optic networks. In the cellular communications industry, we are working closely with industry leaders such as Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Motorola, Inc. and Nokia Oy to develop testing solutions to support next-generation high-capacity wireless cellular standards. We have also worked closely with Rambus in developing advanced test solutions for high-speed memory devices.

13 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) AUTOMATED IN-CIRCUIT TESTING. We believe that we offer the leading family of in-circuit test products, which test printed circuit board assemblies to find defects caused by the manufacturing process. In-circuit testers use a probe fixture which makes electrical contact with the circuit board and provides electrical measurements. These products are used with a suite of proprietary tools for testing printed circuit assemblies where probing may be able to access as little as 50% of the contacts due to very densely packed or very small components. These tools enable our current systems to test up to twice as fast as previous in-circuit test systems. 

AUTOMATED X-RAY INSPECTION. Our leading x-ray inspection products provide a three-dimensional scan of printed circuit board assemblies to identify and isolate quality defects caused by the manufacturing process. Using patented techniques, our products can look through a device to identify structural defects in soldering that are not identified by visual inspection and that may not be detected with in-circuit testing. This technique also eliminates the need for expensive physical probe fixtures. 

AUTOMATED OPTICAL INSPECTION. Our automated optical inspection line of products enables automated visual inspection of printed circuit assemblies. 

These systems are able to locate, with a high degree of repeatability and reliability, misplaced and misaligned parts, gross solder defects and other process faults without the need for a human inspector. 

INTELLIGENT TEST. In products that demand the highest reliability, like those used in networking and communications, customers will often require that their printed circuit assemblies be tested using a combination of automated test processes. Our AwareTest Software enables customers to design test processes that avoid unnecessary test duplication. For example, an in-circuit test device will receive information about the faults that have already been detected by an x-ray inspection system and not repeat the test of that circuit. AwareTest allows customers to obtain maximum test coverage while decreasing total test time and cost. 

SEMICONDUCTOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT Our automated test equipment supports the development and manufacture of semiconductor devices. We produce semiconductor test equipment to perform electrical and functional testing of the operation of memory, logic, mixed signal, systems-on-a-chip, and radio frequency integrated circuits. Our parametric test instruments and systems are used to examine semiconductor wafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process. Our semiconductor parametric test systems combine hardware technology with system software. The software can be customized to meet specific application needs to allow faster verification of the accuracy of the manufacturing process of a silicon wafer and wafer quality through its first electrical test. Our product development efforts are targeted at leading edge technologies, such as systems-on-a-chip and high-speed memory products. 

Our semiconductor test products test a variety of different circuit types. 

These devices are usually tested after final assembly, but the testing of some devices is most effective immediately after the production of the silicon wafer, when the wafers are sorted. We believe we are the industry leader in wafer-sort test solutions for flash memory devices, which retain data even when the power is turned off and that are critical for use in digital cameras, cellular phones, personal digital assistants and storage of portable digital audio files. Our flash memory test products can test as many as 16 devices in parallel, greatly improving test throughput for our customers. 

In the final test area, we are exploiting our successful logic and mixed signal semiconductor test offerings into two market areas. Based on our high performance logic technology, we have recently developed and begun shipping an accurate, high-speed test system, initially focused on Direct Rambus dynamic random access memory chip testing. The Rambus architecture addresses performance 14 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) limitations in other random access memory chips by moving data quickly in and out of memory. Rambus-designed memory has been used in products such as video games for several years. Our Rambus memory testers will initially test 16 devices in parallel. In the year 2000, we expect to offer the ability to test 32 devices in parallel, which we believe will result in an extremely competitive cost of test. 

Our test equipment for the system-on-a-chip market is based on our newest generation logic and mixed signal product platform. This platform is designed to span the wide range of price, performance and functionality that the system-on-a-chip market will require. Also, we produce a radio frequency integrated circuit test system that we believe has established a leadership position in the wireless device market. 

HIGH-FREQUENCY ELECTRONIC DESIGN TOOLS Our high-frequency electronic design automation software tools are used by radio frequency integrated circuit design engineers to model, simulate and analyze communications product designs at the circuit and system levels. Our technology is the first in the industry to allow the simulation of complete communication product design in a single environment. According to Dataquest, we are the leader in the market for high-frequency computer aided engineering software.

In total, we produce more than 9,000 products for high-speed networking, mobile communications and computing devices worldwide. As of October 31, 1999, our semiconductor products business had approximately 10,100 employees worldwide. We have eleven major design centers and eight manufacturing sites around the world. Our semiconductor products business generated revenue of $1.7 billion in fiscal year 1999 and $1.6 billion in fiscal year 1998. 

MARKETS Our semiconductor products business serves two primary markets: communications and computing. 

COMMUNICATIONS HIGH-SPEED NETWORKING. The advent of the Internet as a communications medium has dramatically increased business and consumer demand for high-speed, reliable access to data and, as a result, has placed considerable stress on existing communications networks. In data communications, speed is measured in the number of bits of data per second that can be transmitted across the network. 

As the volume of data transferred over networks grows, users are becoming increasingly frustrated with the low performance of the existing communications infrastructure, which was originally designed for lower speed analog transmission rather than high-speed digital transmission. This infrastructure consists primarily of copper wiring, which was originally intended for analog voice transmission. Copper wiring is highly susceptible to noise and interference, making accurate transmission of data at high speeds difficult. 

Fiber optic cables, which carry information in the form of pulses of light produced by light-emitting diodes or lasers, can carry very large amounts of data in a small space and are immune to electrical and magnetic interference. 

Because fiber optic cables are not susceptible to interference, they can minimize error in data transmission and prevent the crossing of telephone conversations between lines. Fiber optic cables can also provide enhanced security compared to copper wiring, since intercepting communications on a fiber optic line without detection is difficult. Because of these benefits, telecommunications service providers have historically used fiber-optic cables for their ultra-long-distance, typically undersea, communications infrastructure. For a number of years, fiber-optic 18 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) cables have also been the method of choice for long-distance, high-volume voice and data, and have more recently been increasingly used in local area networks, in place of traditional copper wires, for higher-speed and more reliable data communication. 

We are a major supplier of fiber optic transceivers, which convert digital data into light signals for transmission, and convert light signals back into digital form on the receiving end of the communication. We market fiber optic transceivers for both short-range, local area network applications and long-range, wide area network applications to major telecommunications and data networking equipment vendors such as Alcatel, Cisco Systems, Inc., Lucent and Nortel. In addition, we supply high reliability solid-state lasers to major telecommunications companies for high-reliability, ultra-long-distance applications. We are also a major supplier of physical layer integrated circuits for high-speed networking applications, which prepare data for transmission across fiber networks. 

STORAGE AREA NETWORKING. As the volume of data that is being transmitted, processed and stored in networked environments has increased, the market for storage area network equipment, which connects computers and storage devices, has grown dramatically. The increase in data transmission speeds across networks has created a demand for high-speed and high-performance storage-to-server and server-to-server connectivity. The Fibre Channel interconnect protocol, a standard for the transfer of information between computers and storage devices defined by the American National Standards Institute, was developed to meet this growing demand. Fibre Channel supports the transfer of large amounts of data within storage area networks at speeds of one gigabit per second and greater and provides high transmission reliability. We supply a broad range of integrated circuits, fiber optic components and systems to manufacturers of storage area network systems utilizing the Fibre Channel protocol, such as Data General Corporation, EMC Corporation, Hitachi and NEC. 

WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS. Worldwide subscriber growth for wireless communications has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The Strategis Group anticipates that the worldwide market for cellular services will increase to approximately 650 million subscribers by 2002 from approximately 300 million subscribers in 1998. We supply a wide range of radio frequency and microwave integrated circuits and devices to mobile telephone manufacturers and vendors of equipment for the mobile telephone infrastructure to meet this increasing demand. We supply infrared and radio frequency devices and modules for short-range, point-to-point wireless communications to manufacturers of computers, printers and consumer electronics products, such as mobile telephones, digital cameras, personal digital assistants and pagers. 

COMPUTING We are the largest supplier to Hewlett-Packard of ASICs for printers, workstations and servers. ASICs are semiconductors that are designed for a unique, customer-specified application and typically replace a number of discrete components resulting in improved performance, lower cost and high reliability. 

STRATEGY To service the needs of our customers in the communications and computer industries, the semiconductor products business pursues the following strategies: APPLY OUR BROAD TECHNOLOGY BASE TO CAPTURE DEMAND FOR HIGHER-SPEED AND MOBILE DATA TRANSMISSION We have established leadership positions in the design and development of semiconductors used in fiber optic communications and infrared technology. 

Building on this leadership and our broad 19 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) technology base, we continue to invest in designing and marketing semiconductor products to address the growing demand for higher-speed, higher-capacity connections and mobile communications. In particular, we are focused on developing devices that enable data transmission speeds of one gigabit per second or greater to address the increasing demand for high speed networking. We currently produce integrated circuits for the most prevalent mobile communications standards, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the increased demand for these products. 

CONTINUE TO BE HEWLETT-PACKARD'S LEADING SUPPLIER OF ASICS Key elements of our remaining a leading supplier of ASICs to Hewlett-Packard for use in its printers, workstations and servers have been: - our development, external sourcing and application of intellectual property; - our ability to meet competitive pricing and performance requirements; and - our dedicated sales force and co-location of design personnel with major Hewlett-Packard businesses. 

To maintain this position, we will continue to pursue our intellectual property strategy through both internal development and acquisitions, and apply this intellectual property strategically to our products. In addition, to remain competitive, we are focused on reducing the costs and improving the performance of the ASICs we provide to Hewlett-Packard by pursuing higher levels of device integration and employing advanced process technology. We also intend to increase sales of ASICs to purchasers other than Hewlett-Packard, in areas other than workstations, servers and printers, particularly in the networking area. 

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIPS To maintain technology leadership in a cost-effective manner, we have formed several strategic technology partnerships. We intend to continue to enter into strategic technology partnerships to gain access to intellectual property and advanced semiconductor manufacturing process technology. For example, through our joint venture with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, Ltd. and the joint venture's technology sharing arrangements with Motorola, we obtain access to advanced semiconductor process technology and volume production capacity while reducing capital outlays and design process costs.

In addition, we provide graphics chips, core electronics chipsets that surround central processing units and microprocessors for Hewlett-Packard's workstations and servers. However, we expect shipments of microprocessors to Hewlett-Packard to be substantially reduced before the end of 2000. The terms of our license limit our use of Hewlett-Packard's intellectual property for the sale of integrated circuits in printing devices, printer supplies, components and accessories, document scanners and some computing devices for a period of three years in some cases and 10 years in other cases. 

OPTICAL IMAGE SENSORS AND OPTICAL POSITION SENSORS We have recently begun applying our capabilities in optoelectronics and integrated circuit design to image and position sensors. Our sensor products include color and monochrome still and video camera image capture solutions and intelligent optical sensors. Our focus in this area is to enable pervasive imaging through low-cost digital image sensors for use on a stand-alone basis or embedded within personal computers, laptops, peripherals, cellular telephones and affordable digital cameras. 

We also produce optical position motion control products used primarily for motion control in printers and small motors that require precise control. These optical position sensors are used to locate the printing device in an inkjet printer. In addition, our optical image sensors are being used as the sensing system in a new generation of computer mice. 

21 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) LEDS AND OPTOCOUPLERS We manufacture and sell a broad range of LEDs, alphanumeric displays and optocouplers. LEDs are semiconductor devices that emit light when an electrical signal is applied. LEDs and alphanumeric displays are primarily used as status indicators, back-lighting for panels or switches and information in consumer, home office and industrial applications. Typical applications include status indicators on computers, fax and other office equipment, display panels and indicators for audio and video equipment, and as indicators and displays on industrial grade electronic equipment. Optocoupler products are devices that provide both electrical insulation, for protection, and signal isolation, to prevent distortion of data, between differing electrical environments. Typical applications for these products include industrial automation, electrical motor control and data communications interface isolation. 

LIGHTING JOINT VENTURE In November 1999, we extended our existing joint venture with Philips relating to the design and production of LEDs. The joint venture was expanded to take advantage of our technology and manufacturing strength in high-brightness color LEDs, and Philips' strength in developing, manufacturing and selling innovative lighting products and systems. Under the terms of the new agreement, the global joint venture will develop, manufacture and sell LEDs, modules, products and systems for a broad spectrum of lighting applications, including automotive lighting, high-brightness traffic signals, contour lighting and signs, outdoor illumination, and white LEDs for both indoor and outdoor applications. We equally own the joint venture with Philips, which involves approximately 1,000 employees located in California, Malaysia and the Netherlands. 

COMPETITION The markets for our semiconductor products are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase. Our ability to compete effectively depends upon a number of factors, including: - product reliability and performance in operation; - price; - power consumption; - compliance with standards; - product size and integration; and - time to market.

Our products and services include patient monitoring systems, imaging systems, external defibrillators, cardiology products and related professional services and support, each aimed at helping our customers improve the quality of patient care while decreasing their costs. We hold leading market share with our patient monitoring and associated clinical information-management systems for critical care and cardiovascular ultrasound imaging systems. 

We market our products to professionals and institutions in more than 100 countries. We have sales offices in 33 countries and manufacturing sites in Massachusetts and Washington in the United States, China and Germany. As of October 31, 1999, the healthcare solutions business had approximately 4,700 employees worldwide. Our healthcare solutions business generated revenue of $1.5 billion in fiscal year 1999 and $1.3 billion in fiscal year 1998. 

MARKETS The principal markets in which we participate are patient monitoring, ultrasound imaging and external defibrillator and cardiology products. 

PATIENT MONITORING Patient monitoring systems continuously assess a patient's vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and respiration rates, to enable very rapid decision making in emergency and critical care environments. Our patient monitoring systems are used in three major market segments: critical care, anesthesia care and neonatal care. According to Frost & Sullivan, the worldwide market for multi-functional patient monitoring equipment totaled $5.3 billion in 1997, growing at a compound annual rate of 8.7% from 1994 to 1997. This market is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 11.5% from 1998 to 2003. 

24 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) Patient monitoring equipment and services are also used in non-critical care environments. As providers seek to reduce costs, patient care is often being delivered in non-critical care environments. Many patients who previously would have remained in the intensive-care unit are being moved to non-critical care areas, where portable monitors and remote measurement systems are used. These non-critical care areas, which include non-intensive-care areas of hospitals, outpatient care facilities and patients' homes, are expected to provide significant growth opportunities for patient monitoring markets in the future. 

Frost & Sullivan expects the market for lower cost and portable monitoring equipment to grow from $675 million in 1998 to $1.3 billion by the year 2004, a 11.3% compound annual growth rate. 

ULTRASOUND IMAGING Ultrasound imaging systems enable medical professionals to view multiple parts of the human anatomy with high-resolution images that are produced non-invasively from sound waves. The ultrasound imaging equipment market includes cardiovascular, radiology, obstetrical and general imaging equipment. 

Frost & Sullivan estimates that the worldwide market for ultrasound imaging equipment was $2.5 billion in 1998 and grew at a compound annual rate of 5.1% from 1996 to 1998. Frost & Sullivan forecasts the overall market to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.7% over the next five years. Within ultrasound imaging, our principal targeted market is cardiology ultrasound imaging. 

Frost & Sullivan estimates that the global market for cardiology ultrasound imaging equipment was approximately $768 million in 1998 and grew at a compound annual rate of 5.5% from 1996 to 1998. In line with the overall ultrasound market, Frost & Sullivan forecasts the cardiovascular imaging segment to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6.8% over the next five years. 

CARDIOLOGY PRODUCTS Our cardiology products business includes external defibrillators, electrocardiographs and related information systems. External defibrillators are devices that deliver an electrical shock designed to restart the heart of victims of sudden cardiac arrest. Theta Corporation estimates the worldwide external defibrillator market was approximately $425 million for 1998 and forecasts a compound annual growth of 8% for the years 1998 through 2000. The fastest-growing segment of the defibrillator market is the out-of-hospital segment, which is expected to grow, on average, more than 35% annually for the next three years, according to Frost & Sullivan. Each year in the United States, sudden cardiac arrest strikes approximately 350,000 people, of whom less than 5% survive, largely because defibrillators do not reach victims in time. In 1997, the American Heart Association called for the broad deployment of automatic external defibrillators in public places where large groups of people gather and estimated that broader public access to defibrillators could save an additional 20,000 lives each year in the United States. 

We also sell electrocardiography equipment, which measures and displays information about the electrical activity of the heart. Frost & Sullivan estimates that the total worldwide electrocardiography equipment market was approximately $200 million in 1998 and grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.3% from 1991 to 1998. This market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 3.0% over the next three years. 

STRATEGY Our healthcare solutions business focuses on creating and delivering new products and services for the healthcare market, establishing and maintaining a strong reputation with our customers and developing effective strategic partnerships by pursuing the following strategies: 25 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) BRING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS TO TARGETED MARKETS We have established leadership positions in the patient monitoring, ultrasound and cardiology markets. We believe we can expand our market opportunity by moving into new areas of these markets, increasing the market penetration of our existing products and services and delivering new products that offer higher performance at lower prices. In particular, we aim to bring new technologies to the patient monitoring and imaging markets and expand our coverage in developed countries by delivering cost-effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools. We are also focused on developing new, low-cost applications of our existing products to expand our presence in smaller hospitals and less-developed countries. 

TARGET MEDICAL CARE BEYOND THE HOSPITAL We believe that an increasing proportion of healthcare is being delivered outside of the hospital in clinics, surgical centers and doctors' offices, as well as in the workplace and homes. According to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, the average length of stay at hospitals has declined 17.6% from 1990 to 1996. By contrast, outpatient visits increased 37% between 1990 and 1996. This growth in outpatient services has increased demand for products that can enable nurses, other clinicians and nonmedical professionals to provide care outside of the hospital. In 1998, we acquired Heartstream, a market leader in automatic external defibrillators which enable nonmedical professionals to deliver defibrillation in settings outside the hospital. 

Through internal development efforts, we are also delivering cost-effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools, which can decrease the cost of diagnosing and monitoring patients. These tools are targeted at smaller hospitals, mobile clinics and private offices. 

INCREASE PRESENCE IN EMERGING SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE We believe an opportunity exists in emerging countries with underdeveloped healthcare systems and infrastructure. We believe the large and growing populations of these countries will fuel demand for cost-efficient medical products and services. In order to capitalize on this opportunity, we plan to expand our global presence by continuing to invest in the development of low-cost, reliable, high-utility, diagnostic, monitoring and therapy instruments designed to be easily supported in rural areas. We also work with international financial organizations, such as the World Bank, to arrange secured financing services for our customers in these regions. 

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RAPID ADOPTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THE INTERNET AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS The rapid growth of the Internet is fueling the adoption of Internet-based healthcare services, medical care by telephone and online self-care. According to Cyber Dialogue, by the year 2000 an estimated 30 million Americans will use the Internet to learn about options for treatment, self-care and prevention. To take advantage of this accelerating trend, we are working with medical professionals to deploy Internet-based communication systems that link medical professionals and patients. For example, our CodeRunner Web product allows healthcare professionals to review a summary of cardiac resuscitation efforts to ensure that approved procedures were followed in an emergency situation. 

Increasingly, our customers are demanding clinical diagnostic information systems based on open standards for easier and more cost-effective access to medical data. To proactively participate in the definition of new industry standards and ensure compliance of our products and technologies, we are currently leading several industry-wide efforts to create and promulgate standards for communication and interoperability among disparate healthcare systems. 

26 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) DEVELOP POINT-OF-CARE TECHNOLOGIES Point-of-care diagnostic products consist of blood-and-tissue analysis systems that provide immediate or continuous diagnostic results at the patient's bedside. These systems include portable, microprocessor-based analyzers that employ single-use, disposable cartridges to perform simultaneously several of the most frequently ordered blood tests in a simple 90-second procedure. These biochemistry-based devices provide accurate and reliable blood test results more quickly, cost-effectively and simply than most advanced clinical laboratory equipment. We believe market acceptance of point-of-care diagnostics is increasing. In 1995, we entered into an agreement with i-STAT Corporation to enter the point-of-care testing marketplace with critical blood parameters. In 1999, we entered into a worldwide agreement with Diametrics Medical Incorporated in order to provide both continuous and intermittent blood monitoring capabilities. These companies' biochemical sensors, when integrated into our monitoring platforms, enable time-sensitive measurements to be made quickly and accurately at a patient's bedside for faster diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. We intend to continue to enhance our patient monitoring capabilities by developing alliances with other companies. 

FOCUS ON THE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESSES Our products and solutions primarily address the need for the diagnosis and treatment of non-critical illnesses in a clinical setting. We believe healthcare expenditures are shifting from acute care in the hospital to ongoing care or treatment of long-standing conditions, as a result of the dramatic growth in the elderly population and advances in life-extending medical therapies and technologies. Therefore, we have recently begun to pursue opportunities focused on the ongoing management and treatment of chronic illnesses. We introduced our first product to address the chronic care market, our remote measurement solution, in late 1999. It is our intention that this solution will assist clinicians in successfully managing congestive heart failure patients at home. 

Studies show that this type of disease management program increases patient comfort while avoiding costly hospital emergency visits. 

PRODUCTS Our products and services include patient monitoring, imaging systems, cardiology products and related professional services. 

PATIENT MONITORING According to a 1998 study by Frost & Sullivan, we maintain a leadership position in the market for patient monitoring and related information management systems. Our products range from critical-care bedside monitors, fetal monitoring and remote-measurement systems to central station monitors, associated clinical decision support systems and critical-care information-management systems. Our clinical decision support and critical-care information-management systems are scalable based on department protocols, severity of patient condition and workflow requirements. Our solutions range from basic surveillance and centralized alarms to very large system configurations that provide comprehensive patient information-management support. 

We have supplied over 170,000 units worldwide of our modular Viridia Component Monitoring System family of patient monitors. The Viridia CMS monitors support more than 20 different kinds of clinical measurements in critical care, anesthesia and perinatal care. Our Viridia Information Center is one of the industry's most advanced real-time, patient data analysis and surveillance solutions offering data at a central station. It enables clinicians to provide more effective care through the analysis, integration and management of patient information. The Viridia Information Center integrates the data management and review capabilities of a clinical workstation with the features of a central monitor for 27 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) increased productivity and improved quality of care. Our CareVue clinical information system, deployed at the point of care, captures, stores and makes available data that can be configured for comprehensive reports. CareVue enables multiple caregivers to analyze patient data in order to improve outcomes, analyze care protocols and perform research and continuous quality improvements. 

We have established a number of strategic relationships to provide us with certain clinical applications to be used with our existing products and products under development, including our agreements with Diametrics Medical and i-STAT Corporation in point-of-care blood chemistry. Continuous and intermittent monitoring sensors provided by these partners, when integrated into our monitoring platforms, enable these time-sensitive measurements to be made quickly and accurately at a patient's bedside for faster diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. 

ULTRASOUND IMAGING We have a broad range of ultrasound imaging products, which are used by doctors and technicians in cardiology, radiology, obstetrics, vascular, emergency and operating departments to diagnose non-invasively a range of diseases and abnormalities throughout the body. Our U.S. cardiac-ultrasound business was ranked number one in the industry for overall quality of service and support by International Marketing Ventures in 1998 for the fourth year in a row. We offer three major ultrasound platforms: SONOS 5500, SONOS 4500 and ImagePoint Hx. SONOS 5500 is a premium performance cardiovascular ultrasound system used for both research and clinical applications, while SONOS 4500 is a high-performance cardiovascular ultrasound system used primarily in the clinical environment. ImagePoint Hx is a multispecialty product used in a broad range of ultrasound applications to address the broad needs of physicians working in smaller hospitals, mobile clinics and offices. 

Our technology differentiates our ultrasound products from products of competitors. A key component of ultrasound products is the transducer, a complex electro-mechanical device that transmits sound waves into the body and converts the returning echoes into electrical signals, providing for the display of high quality images of human anatomy. We believe our proprietary transducers provide the widest bandwidth, or range of soundwave frequencies, in the industry, enabling the ultrasound system to optimize image detail and penetration without making the operator switch transducers. Another key technology in ultrasound products, signal processing, takes the electrical signals from the transducers and converts them into a high quality image. An example is our proprietary Acoustic Quantification, which automatically measures critical characteristics of the beating heart, eliminating time-consuming manual measurements. Our expertise in signal processing has also led to the development of proprietary ASICs, which have enabled us to provide ultrasound imaging equipment with enhanced performance for the same or lower cost. 

To address the information-management needs of our ultrasound customers, we have developed EnConcert, which consists of a series of software applications running on personal computer hardware. EnConcert allows clinicians to review, measure, manage and archive images, reports and patient data related to their ultrasound exams. These tools improve doctors' efficiency and allow them to communicate exam results more rapidly to their colleagues. 

CARDIOLOGY PRODUCTS We develop and manufacture external defibrillators, electrocardiographs and electrocardiogram information management systems. An external defibrillator is a device that delivers an electrical charge that can restart a person's heart in sudden cardiac arrest or restore a heart's correct rhythm in cases of irregular heartbeat. An electrocardiograph is a diagnostic tool that measures and displays the 28 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) characteristics of the heart's electrical activity. An electrocardiogram management system allows for the digital storage, review and retrieval of electrocardiograms. 

We produce both manual and automatic external defibrillators. Manual defibrillators are used by highly trained medical personnel, primarily in hospitals and paramedic units. We believe our CodeMaster manual defibrillator product line is one of the most extensive in the industry. Our products are designed for both hospital and out-of-hospital use and are recognized as having the fastest charge time in the industry. In addition to their reliability and ease of use, our defibrillation products record the patient data monitored, and action taken by the caregiver, for review by an emergency medical director or other responsible parties, to enable monitoring of caregiver performance and product effectiveness. We also have the industry's first pre-hospital product with predictive software that provides information used to accelerate assessment and triage of patients with chest pains so that appropriate therapy can begin promptly. 

Automatic external defibrillators are portable defibrillators that are used by nonmedical professionals to deliver on-site defibrillation following a cardiac event. Given the relatively low cost and ease of use, these systems are well suited for deployment in places where people congregate. Purchasers of our ForeRunner automatic external defibrillators include American Airlines, Inc., Delta Air Lines, Inc., United Air Lines, Inc., Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Hilton Gaming Corporation and Sundance Ski Resort. The ForeRunner's competitive advantage is based upon its unique, proprietary, low-energy biphasic waveform. A biphasic waveform is a form of energy where the electrical current is reversed midway through the pulse. We believe this technology enables the ForeRunner to be lighter, less costly, safer, more reliable and the smallest external defibrillator in the market. 

Our electrocardiographs monitor the characteristics of the heart's electrical activity to enable cardiology professionals to provide accurate diagnoses and deliver care for cardiac patients. Our electrocardiogram information management systems allow cardiologists in institutions where large numbers of electrocardiograms are taken each day to automate the flow of information efficiently and generate accurate diagnostic reports for referring physicians. This system is based on industry standard computing platforms and also provides for remote connectivity and information access using standard Internet software. 

We have also established strategic alliances for our cardiology products business. For example, we have an agreement with Dr. Harry P. Selker, Chief of the Division of Clinical Research at the New England Medical Center, to jointly develop predictive instruments to help accelerate the assessment and triage of patients who may be having a cardiac event. Dr. Selker provides us with clinical and technical input and product evaluation by clinical trial, while we provide software and hardware engineering and development. We also have an agreement with Zymed, Inc. in electrocardiograms. Zymed's 'EASI 12-lead' technology, when integrated into our monitoring platforms, provides the ability to more quickly and easily acquire, process and transmit a derived 12-lead electrocardiogram using five electrodes instead of the customary 10 used today in the critical care setting. 

CUSTOMERS We provide products and services to a broad range of customers in the industry. Within the last 12 months, 91% of the largest 2,000 hospitals in the United States purchased our equipment and/or services. Outpatient clinics, doctors' offices and public facilities, travel companies and entertainment providers are also a growing part of our customer base. 

29 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) A representative list of customers of our healthcare solutions business follows: SALES, MARKETING AND SUPPORT Our products and services are sold through both direct and indirect channels. We have sales offices in 33 countries and more than 2,400 direct sales and service personnel. Our sales strategy is to sell to and service our largest accounts (hospital and corporate business) directly while employing third-party distributors and manufacturer's representatives for smaller or more geographically dispersed countries. Electronic commerce is also an integral and growing element of our sales and distribution strategy. Today, customers can access product and service information for all our products, and they can purchase medical supplies and replacement parts on our website.

Our competition in the external defibrillator market comes primarily from Physio Control Corporation (a subsidiary of Medtronic Inc.) and Zoll Medical Corporation. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION The products developed and marketed by our healthcare solutions business are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following product activities: - design and development; - testing, including animal and human studies; - labeling; - premarket clearance or approval; - manufacturing; - storage; 31 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) - advertising and promotion; and - sales and distribution. 

In the United States, medical devices are classified on the basis of controls deemed necessary to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls, such as labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA's Quality System Regulations, which incorporate current good manufacturing practices that are applicable to medical devices. Class II devices are subject to general and special controls. Special controls include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidelines. Most class III devices are controlled through the premarket approval process to ensure their safety and effectiveness. 

Prior to commercialization, premarket notification clearance generally must be obtained for class I and II devices as well as class III devices for which the FDA has not called for premarket approval. For most class III devices, a premarket approval application is required and must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness. The notification or application typically includes: - results of bench and laboratory tests; - when appropriate, results of animal tests and clinical studies; - a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device; and - proposed labeling and advertising literature. 

Most medical devices marketed by the healthcare solutions business are class II or "Pre-Amendment" class III devices, which currently require only premarket clearance. The healthcare solutions business does not market any class III device requiring premarket approval in the United States, but it may do so in the future or the FDA may require by regulation that premarket approval applications be submitted for our existing "Pre-Amendment" class III devices. 

Once clearance or approval is obtained, FDA oversight continues. We are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the Quality System Regulations for all our products. The FDA enforces the Quality System Regulations through periodic inspections of our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers. The Quality System Regulations relate to product testing and quality assurance, as well as to the maintenance of records and documentation. We are required to provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our medical devices, as well as on product malfunctions that could contribute to death or serious injury. The FDA also restricts the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses. 

If the FDA believes we are not in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or its regulations it can: - detain or seize our products; - order or request a recall; - seek an injunction against future violations; - assess civil penalties against us; and - initiate criminal proceedings against us. 

Compliance with other regulatory requirements is necessary to market our medical devices outside the United States. These regulations vary from country to country. 

32 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) CHEMICAL ANALYSIS Our chemical analysis business is a leading provider of analytical instrument systems that enable customers to identify, quantify, analyze and test the atomic, molecular, physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our chemical analysis products and services are used by scientists, engineers and technicians working in research and development, quality assurance, quality control and manufacturing. 

Our four main product lines are chromatography, spectroscopy, bio-instrumentation and related consumables. We also provide service and customer support for our products. Chromatographs separate a mixed sample in gas or liquid form into its component compounds so that these components can be analyzed individually. Mass spectrometers identify and quantify molecules and elements within a sample by measuring the mass of atoms. Bio-instrumentation is used in the analysis of complex compounds, such as DNA. 

Our chemical analysis business offers a wide range of products and services that are sold primarily into the hydrocarbon-processing, environmental, pharmaceutical and bioscience markets. We are a leading provider of chromatography and mass spectrometry systems used by research and development and quality assurance laboratories for the measurement and analysis of chemical compounds. We believe that we are also a leader in the sale of benchtop inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS), which are generally acknowledged as the most powerful tools for the detection of minute quantities of metals. 

Some of the uses of our instrument systems are: - determining octane levels in gasoline; - analyzing pesticide levels in drinking water; - ascertaining the quality of compounds in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals; - identifying impurities in the manufacture of semiconductors; and - analyzing DNA for various life science applications. 

We employed approximately 3,600 people as of October 31, 1999 in our chemical analysis business. We have manufacturing and product development centers in China, Germany, Japan and the United States and marketing centers in Germany, the United States, and Singapore. Our chemical analysis business generated revenue of $1.0 billion in fiscal year 1999 and $938 million in fiscal year 1998. 

MARKETS Strategic Directions International estimates that in 1998, worldwide revenue in the analytical instrumentation market totaled approximately $15.9 billion. 

According to Strategic Directions International, growth of the overall analytical instrumentation market between 1998 to 2001 is expected to be approximately 8% annually. The primary markets served by our chemical analysis business are the hydrocarbon processing, environmental, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. We estimate that our market represents approximately 30% of the total available analytical instrumentation market that we serve. 

HYDROCARBON PROCESSING The hydrocarbon processing industry encompasses the natural gas, petroleum refining, petrochemical and chemical markets. This industry spends approximately $2.2 billion annually on 33 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) analytical instrumentation. We sell primarily gas chromatographs and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry products and systems into these markets. 

Petroleum refiners use our measurement solutions to analyze crude oil composition and perform other raw material analysis, verify and improve refining processes, and ensure the overall quality of gasoline, fuels, lubricants and other products. Our gas chromatographs are used to monitor consistent quality in the natural gas delivered to consumers and industry. Petrochemical and chemical producers use our products to measure and control the quality of their finished products and to verify the environmental safety of their operations. We expect growth in these markets to be driven by: (A) migration of measurement and analysis activities out of the centralized labs and closer to the process, (B) standardization of measurement processes across companies' worldwide operations, and (C) technologies that improve analysts' productivity. 

ENVIRONMENTAL We develop and market analytical instrumentation for the environmental market for applications such as laboratory and field analysis and characterization of chemical pollutants in air, water, soils, solid waste, agriculture and food products. Environmental industry customers include all levels of government, the industrial and manufacturing sectors, engineering and consulting companies, commercial testing laboratories, colleges and universities. We expect growth in this market to be driven by: (A) government legislation, enforcement, site assessment and monitoring, (B) multi-national trade agreements, (C) concerns about public health and food safety and (D) technologies that identify new environmental risks. We believe these factors will lead to more demand for environmental instrumentation in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Eastern Europe regions, as these regions implement new and stricter environmental regulations. 

PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL Our analytical-instrument solutions are used by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies in every phase of the drug development process. This includes research into the basic causes of disease, identification and development of new drugs, obtaining regulatory approval, manufacturing and distribution. Strategic Directions International estimates that these companies will spend approximately $3.8 billion on analytical instrumentation in 2002. 

Drug discovery is extremely costly and involves high risk. The Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers' Association indicates that it costs an average of $500 million to discover and develop a new drug. Therefore, investment in productivity-enhancing technology, such as analytical instrument solutions, is critical to reducing the time and cost it takes to bring new drugs to the consumer. 

STRATEGY In order to maintain our leading position in the analytical instrumentation market, our strategy is as follows: TARGET HIGH-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOPHARMACEUTICAL MARKETS We believe the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical markets represent a high-growth opportunity for us, as participants in these markets continue to invest significant resources in research and development. Companies in this industry are constantly in search of ways to discover and develop new drugs faster and at lower cost. We continue to invest in developing new instruments and technologies to address these requirements. For example, through our strategic relationship with Caliper Technologies Corporation, we have developed instrumentation that enables chemical analysis procedures to be performed on the surface of the Caliper LabChip device. We have recently begun marketing the 34 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) LabChip device, which uses a technology called microfluidics to manipulate minute quantities of various fluids. The LabChip device is designed to enable researchers to conduct analysis at a fraction of the time and cost it would take using conventional techniques. 

Pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies are also investing in bio-instrumentation that increases understanding of the genetic cause of diseases in order to speed the development and increase the efficacy of new drugs. We will continue to focus resources on the development of technologies to address this market segment. For example, we have relationships with Affymetrix, Rosetta Inpharmatics and Oxford Gene Technology to develop instruments that enable identification of important genetic information. 

FOCUS ON GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN CURRENT MARKETS We will continue to focus resources on growth opportunities in markets we currently address. We believe that emerging markets, particularly in the Asia Pacific, Latin America and Eastern Europe regions, represent a growth opportunity for analytical instrumentation, as investments in basic industries, infrastructure and environmental protection increase over the coming years. To address these emerging markets, we are broadening our worldwide distribution capabilities and developing less complex instrumentation with lower prices. 

Additionally, in order to differentiate our product offerings and increase our market share in developed markets, we intend to continue to grow our portfolio of services and consumable products, enabling us to offer our customers more complete solutions. Finally, we continue to develop gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy products that are smaller and more portable to meet increasing demand for use of these instruments outside of centralized laboratories. 

BRING NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO MARKET FASTER We seek to bring new products and technologies to market both through internal development and the strategic acquisition of technologies from third parties. Internal development of new technology is accomplished through a combination of discoveries at Agilent Technologies Laboratories and research and development efforts within our chemical analysis business. Agilent Technologies Laboratories is primarily focused on basic long-term research, while our chemical analysis business emphasizes research and development of technology for more immediate commercialization. We also focus considerable effort on developing solutions that meet the current and anticipated needs of customers. 

For example, we are expanding our programs to offer customers early access to products under development to ensure that these products are meeting customer needs. In addition, our development of modular hardware and software platforms allows us to bring new generations of products to market faster. 

In addition to our internal efforts, we consider acquisitions to complement our current products, solutions and technologies and to accelerate our entry into strategic markets. 

LEVERAGE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS AND ALLIANCES We intend to build strategic relationships to enable us to develop products and services that complement existing technologies and products in our target markets. For example, through our relationship with Caliper Technologies Corp., we are conducting joint research and development in microfluidics. This has resulted in the commercialization of the LabChip technology, which is designed to increase the speed and accuracy of traditional analytical methods. 

In addition, through our strategic alliances, we develop instruments that work with our partners' products, enabling us to offer our customers a broader range of products and solutions. These alliances 35 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) also help our customers to reduce the time and resources needed to integrate disparate products from separate vendors. 

PRODUCTS A key factor in our target markets is the need for new products that increase productivity of the end customer. Our chemical analysis products, systems and services enable our customers to analyze water, air and soil for monitoring and remediation; to understand the properties of natural and man- made gases, liquids and chemically-based products; and to advance knowledge of the genetic basis of disease and enable the development, testing and use of new drugs. Our four main product lines, chromatography, spectroscopy, bio-instrumentation and related consumables, are described below. 

GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY Gas chromatographs are used to separate molecules of a gaseous mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. A gas chromatograph can analyze gas samples as well as solids and liquids that can be converted to a gaseous state. Most gas chromatographs have the approximate size and appearance of a large microwave oven. 

We are the worldwide market leader in the $1 billion gas chromatograph industry, according to Strategic Directions International. Our gas chromatography systems are used in many industries, including pharmaceutical, hydrocarbon processing, environmental, foods and flavors, forensics and consumer products. Our instruments are used in laboratories involved in research and development, quality assurance, quality control and routine testing. We also produce portable chromatography systems used in the field for performing on-site, real-time measurements. Our products are used to test the quality and safety of food, air and water; to develop cleaner-burning fuels and more effective pharmaceuticals; and to test for alcohol in blood, drugs in urine or explosive residues in crime scene evidence. 

LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY Liquid chromatographs are used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. These instruments are modular in construction and can be configured to form instruments that perform specific analyses. Each module is about the size of a home videocassette recorder. 

According to Strategic Directions International, the high-performance liquid chromatography market is larger than any other analytical instrument market, exceeding $1.8 billion in 1998 with an estimated annual growth rate of 8% over the next five years. High-performance liquid chromatographs are an essential tool in the pharmaceutical industry for basic research, drug development and clinical trials of new drugs. Other industry groups that utilize high-performance liquid chromatographs include chemical development and manufacturing, industry and government testing laboratories for safety, quality and nutritional content of foods and beverages, athlete monitoring for illegal drug use and environmental monitoring. 

MASS SPECTROSCOPY Mass spectroscopy systems break molecules into their component parts and analyze these parts. Our mass spectrometers range in size from that of a small microwave oven to that of a medium-sized refrigerator. 

36 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) We are a leader in the worldwide mass spectroscopy market, which Strategic Directions International estimates to have been about $518 million in 1998. Mass spectroscopy systems are typically used in combination with gas or liquid chromatographs in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor and environmental industries. The combined instruments are used to study and refine the chemical structure of new drugs, to determine the presence of impurities in semiconductors as they are manufactured, or to research the presence of heavy metals and other unwanted substances in soil and water. 

BIO-INSTRUMENTATION We have developed relationships with Affymetrix, Rosetta Inpharmatics, Oxford Gene Technology and Caliper Technologies to address opportunities in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries In December 1999 we announced the launch of a DNA microarray program for the life sciences that incorporates technologies from both Rosetta and OGT, among others. This program is intended to enable researchers to access gene expression information faster and more cost effectively. This knowledge helps researchers to determine the impact of a drug on a cell or group of cells, and to consequently determine the drug's efficacy or toxicity. Knowledge of gene expression profiles can also help researchers to identify new drug targets. In addition, our GeneArray system allows a researcher to use GeneChip arrays designed by Affymetrix to enable high-speed detection and characterization of large amounts of genetic information. These results are useful in identifying defects in genes that cause disease. 

In addition to our gene analysis system, we are also developing faster ways to conduct chemical analysis for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. The new Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer instrument systems that we have developed through our relationship with Caliper Technologies integrate a large number of chemical-analysis procedures onto a single chip. We develop and distribute instrumentation that extracts and analyzes data from the microchip developed by Caliper Technologies, using advanced microfluidics technology. 

Using miniature, integrated chemical-processing systems etched into glass, silicon, quartz or plastic, the microchip allows the steps customarily performed in conventional instruments to be done using minute quantities of costly liquids in a fraction of the usual time. We believe these new systems will speed up chemical analysis significantly while reducing costs. 

CONSUMABLES We also offer consumable products, including chromatograph columns, analytical reagents and other accessories and supplies used by our customers during the analytical experimentation process. Columns are metal or glass tubes containing various substances that are inserted into chromatographs to assist in the process of separating compounds into their constituent parts. Reagents are chemicals used to perform analysis on the resulting constituent parts. Other accessories and supplies we provide range from rubber rings to syringes to safety glasses. 

Our offerings include both generic consumables, where we seek to distinguish our products on price, selection and customer loyalty, and proprietary consumables developed by us, where we offer exclusive technology, performance and functionality. 

37 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) CUSTOMERS We sell our products and services to a broad array of customers in each of the markets we serve. Our top customers by market segment are the following: SALES, MARKETING AND SUPPORT Our sales and support delivery channels are aligned by our key markets to maximize market coverage and to optimize selling and support delivery efficiency.

We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. We selectively use partners to provide manufacturing capabilities outside our core competencies, such as the manufacture of printed circuit assemblies and the delivery of shipment logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California and Delaware in the United States, China, Germany and Japan. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION The chemical analysis product and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis business are subject to regulation in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by Environmental Protection Agency for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an Environmental Protection Agency inventory of chemical substances. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, the Environmental Protection Agency can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that contains a chemical that is out of compliance or can impose fines and penalties. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The process of developing new high-technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. It requires, among other things, innovation and accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. Without the introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services are likely to become technologically obsolete over time, in which case revenue would be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that such new products and services, if and when introduced, will achieve market acceptance. After the products 39 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) and services are developed, we must quickly manufacture and deliver such products and services in sufficient volumes at acceptable costs to meet demand. 

Research and development expenditures were $997 million in fiscal year 1999, $948 million in fiscal year 1998 and $880 million in fiscal year 1997. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Our general policy has been to seek patent and other intellectual property protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or to give us a competitive advantage. While we believe that our patents and applications have value, in general no single patent is in itself essential. In addition, we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that our rights will provide significant competitive advantages. 

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS Our net revenue originating outside the United States, as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 55.2% in fiscal year 1999, 54.4% in fiscal year 1998 and 56.3% in fiscal year 1997, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Approximately 20% of our international revenue in the last three years was derived from Japan. 

Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we make certain sales in international markets directly from the United States. 

Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, the overlap of different tax structures, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt, investment and finance receivable portfolios we incur. 

We believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 15, "Segment Information," of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 

MATERIALS Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies, and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. We believe that the materials and supplies necessary for our manufacturing operations are presently available in the quantities required. 

We purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For many of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources are readily available. In certain instances, however, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with, or make advance payments to, certain suppliers to ensure supply. Portions of our manufacturing operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver quality components, subassemblies and completed products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution 40 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) schedules. The failure of suppliers to deliver these components, subassemblies and products in a timely manner may adversely affect our operating results until alternate sources could be developed. In addition, we periodically experience constrained supply of certain component parts in some product lines as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts. Such constraints, if persistent, may adversely affect our operating results. However, we believe that alternate suppliers or design solutions could be arranged within a reasonable time so that material long-term adverse impacts would be minimized. 

ENVIRONMENTAL Our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws; however, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our company may not require our company to incur substantial expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. These laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur substantial expenditures. 

Some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination that is undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard. 

Hewlett-Packard has agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. While we expect that Hewlett-Packard will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with Hewlett-Packard, Hewlett-Packard will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. 

Hewlett-Packard has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unexpected expenses associated with the remediation. 

In addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although Hewlett-Packard has agreed to indemnify us with respect to that subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of our company will not affect Hewlett-Packard's obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters. 

We are liable and are indemnifying Hewlett-Packard for any contamination found at all facilities being transferred to us excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are indemnifying Hewlett-Packard for any liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties to be transferred by Hewlett-Packard to us, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that related to our businesses. 

While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future. 

We are being indemnified by Hewlett-Packard with respect to all environmental liabilities for which Hewlett-Packard accrued a reserve and we are not aware of any material and probable environmental liabilities being assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.
