Item 3. 
Legal Proceedings In November 2001, a securities class action, Kassin v. Agilent Technologies, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 01-CV-10639, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court") against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ("IPO"), Agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the IPO. In 2003, the Court granted Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims against Agilent based on Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act, but denied Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims based on Section 11 of the Securities Act. On June 14, 2004, papers formalizing a settlement among the plaintiffs, Agilent and more than 200 other issuer defendants and insurers were presented to the Court. Under the proposed settlement, plaintiffs' claims against Agilent and its directors and officers would be released, in exchange for a contingent payment (which, if made, would be paid by Agilent's insurer) and an assignment of certain potential claims. However, class certification of plaintiffs' underlying action against the underwriter defendants was a condition of the settlement. On December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Court's order certifying such a class in several "test cases" that had been selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs. On January 5, 2007, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing to the full bench of the Second Circuit. On April 6, 2007, the Second Circuit issued an order denying rehearing but noted that plaintiffs are free to "seek certification of a more modest class." On June 25, 2007, the Court entered an order terminating the proposed settlement between plaintiffs and the issuer defendants based on a stipulation among the parties. Plaintiffs have amended their allegations and filed amended complaints in six "test cases" (none of which involve Agilent). Defendants in these cases have moved to dismiss the amended complaints. On March 26, 2008, the Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs have also moved for class certifications in these test cases, which the defendants in these cases have opposed. No hearing dates have been set for the class-certification motion. Discovery is also proceeding in these cases. It is uncertain if or when there will be any revised or future settlement. Under our separation agreements with Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"), HP agreed to indemnify us for a substantial portion of IPO-related liabilities. If the litigation against Agilent continues, Agilent believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the case vigorously. We believe the likelihood that Agilent will be required to pay any material amount is remote. 
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
