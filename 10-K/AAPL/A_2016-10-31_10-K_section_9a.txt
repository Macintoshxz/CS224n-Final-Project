Item 9A. 

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2016, pursuant to and as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2016, the company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective and designed to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in the company's reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). As a result of that assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2016 based on criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the year ended October 31, 2015, management identified certain errors in the tax accounts, primarily related to prior years, and disclosed a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for income taxes. 

To remediate the material weakness described above, during fiscal 2016, we designed and implemented additional rigorous reviews and other controls and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to validate the inputs and outputs for the significant tax accounting processes, as well as enhancing the tax accounting expertise within the tax function. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the controls were operating effectively and have concluded that the material weakness has been remediated. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during Agilent's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
