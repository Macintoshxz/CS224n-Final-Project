Item 5. 
Market for the Registrant s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol A. For the 2001 and 2002 fiscal years, the New York Stock Exchange reported the high and low prices per quarter as follows: As of December 2, 2002, there were 71,232 stockholders of record of common stock. The closing share price for our common stock on December 2, 2002, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, was $19.30. 
We have not paid any dividends to date, and we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Under the First Amendment to Five Year Credit Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2001, and the Amendment to 364 Day Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated 27 as of November 19, 2001, we were restricted from declaring or paying any dividends, other than in shares of our common stock, unless our consolidated earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization was at least $200 million for the two quarters immediately prior to such declaration or payment. We have terminated our credit facilities because we believe that the costs of renewing and/or retaining them outweighed their benefits. As of November 2, 2002, we are no longer subject to the restrictions or covenants contained in such credit facilities. See Note 17, Senior Convertible Debentures and Lines of Credit, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 15 of this report for further discussion.
