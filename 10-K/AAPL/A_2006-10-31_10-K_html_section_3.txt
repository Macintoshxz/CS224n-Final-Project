Item 3. 
Legal Proceedings In November 2001, a securities class action, Kassin v. Agilent Technologies, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 01-CV-10639, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court") against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ("IPO"), Agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the IPO. In 2003, the Court granted Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims against Agilent based on Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act, but 26 denied Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims based on Section 11 of the Securities Act. Agilent and more than 200 other issuer defendants have reached an agreement in principle for a settlement with plaintiffs. Under the settlement, plaintiffs' claims against Agilent and its directors and officers would be released, in exchange for a contingent payment (which, if made, would be paid by Agilent's insurer) and an assignment of certain potential claims. On June 14, 2004, papers formalizing the settlement among the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and insurers were presented to the Court in New York. On February 15, 2005, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement conditioned upon the parties' modification of a proposed bar order contained in the settlement. On August 31, 2005, the Court confirmed its preliminary approval of the settlement. On April 24, 2006, the Court held a fairness hearing in connection with the motion for final approval of the settlement. The Court did not issue a ruling on the motion for final approval at the fairness hearing. On December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Court's order certifying a class in several "test cases" that had been selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the coordinated proceeding in re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation. The settlement remains subject to a number of conditions, including final approval of the Court. Plaintiffs continue to prosecute their claims against the underwriter defendants, and discovery is now underway. Under our separation agreements with HP, HP agreed to indemnify us for a substantial portion of IPO-related liabilities. If the settlement does not occur, and the litigation against the company continues, Agilent believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the case vigorously. In light of the pending settlement, we do not expect this case to be material. 
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
