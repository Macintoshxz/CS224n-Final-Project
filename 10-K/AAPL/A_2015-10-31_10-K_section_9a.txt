Item 9A. 

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2015, pursuant to and as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 31, 2015, the company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were not effective due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, believes the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). As a result of that evaluation, management concluded that a material weakness exists as described below. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant s annual or interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. During the year ended October 31, 2015, management identified certain errors in the tax accounts, primarily related to prior years, and as a result, concluded that the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for income taxes. Specifically, certain controls activities over the completeness and accuracy of our accounting for (i) U.S. taxes on foreign earnings, (ii) international provision for income taxes and (iii) reconciliation of income taxes payable were not performed on a timely basis or at the appropriate level of precision. The errors identified by management during the year ended October 31, 2015, when combined with errors identified in prior years, resulted in the Company revising its consolidated financial statements as of October 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, for the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013, and for each of the quarters of the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014. These control deficiencies in the accounting for income taxes could result in a material misstatement that would not be prevented or detected. 

Because of the material weakness, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015 based on criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during Agilent's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Material Weakness Remediation Efforts 112 Management has and will continue to enhance its controls which include refinements and enhancements to the design (including the review and supervision and the level of precision) of certain controls over the accounting for income taxes. Enhancements previously made to certain controls contributed to the identification of the errors which impacted prior periods. The Company s enhanced controls however had an insufficient period of time to operate for management to conclude that they were operating effectively. As such, at October 31, 2015 there continues to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement related to the accounting for income taxes may still not be prevented or detected. With the effective operation of these enhanced controls, the Company expects remediation of the material weakness in fiscal 2016.
