Our key product categories include: liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, microarrays, Polymerase Chain Reaction ("PCR") instrumentation, related bioreagents, electrophoresis, laboratory automation and robotics, software and informatics, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ("NMR") and Magnetic Resonance Imaging ("MRI') systems, and, consumables and services. 
12 We employed approximately 4,300 people as of October 31, 2010 in our life sciences business. This business generated revenue of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2010, $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008. 
Life Science Markets Our life sciences business focuses primarily on the following two markets: The Pharma, Biotech, CRO & CMO Market. 
This market consists of "for-profit" companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research, discovery & development, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control. One sub-segment of this market is core and emerging pharmaceutical companies, or "Pharma". A second sub-segment includes biotechnology companies, or "biotech", contract research organizations, or "CROs", and contract manufacturing organizations, or "CMOs". Biotech companies and, to a somewhat lesser extent, CROs and CMOs typically participate in specific points in the Pharma industry value chain. 
The Academic and Government Market. 
This market consists primarily of "not-for-profit" organizations and includes academic institutions, large government institutes and privately funded organizations. The academic and government research market plays an influential role in technology adoption and therapeutic developments for Pharma and molecular diagnostics companies. After decades of investment in basic biomedical research by government funding bodies, the focus has widened to include translational research multidisciplinary scientific efforts directed at "accelerating therapy development". Notable are efforts by the National Institute of Health, the National Cancer Institute, the European Organisation for Research and the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the Genomics Institute of Singapore (GIS), the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and the National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC). In addition, large donations by private foundations are also fueling growth in this key market segment. 
Life Science Measurement Products and Applications A key factor in all of our life science measurement target markets is the need for new products that increase customer productivity and provide high quality data that enable decision-making by our customers. Our key product segments include: Liquid Chromatography Products A liquid chromatograph ("LC") or a high performance liquid chromatograph ("HPLC") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be stepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi-method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or multi-dimensional LC and can be extended to application-based analyzers e.g. for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatograhy. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and diagnostics offerings and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements. 
Mass Spectrometry Products A mass spectrometer ("MS") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical's molecular mass and characteristic patterns of fragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Liquid chromatography ("LC") is commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the 13 MS system. The combined use of LC and MS ("LC/MS") is frequently used both to identify and quantify chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing small molecules and can also be used to characterize and quantify proteins and other biological entities. Agilent's LC/MS portfolio includes instruments built around five main analyzer types single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight ("TOF") and quadrupole time-of-flight ("QTOF"). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio over the past three years with a focus on improving performance, reliability, and ease of use. 
Microarray Products Agilent is a leading provider of microarray-based, genomics research solutions. Our end-to-end solution includes reagents for sample preparation and microarray processing; hardware for sample QC and high-throughput microarray scanning; 60-mer oligo microarrays on industry-standard 1" 3" glass slides for gene expression; comparative genomic hybridization ("CGH")/Copy Number variation ("CNV") analysis, microRNA, methylation, splice variants, and chromatin immunoprecipitation applications; custom microarray design services; and GeneSpring software products for data analysis. We also provide target enrichment products for next-generation sequencing platforms. In 2010, we released SureSelect XT Target Enrichment System, the first fully customizable liquid genome partitioning / enrichment sample prep system that enhances and accelerates nucleic acid sequencing experiment when used in front of "next generation" sequencing technologies. 
PCR Instrumentation The acquisition of Stratagene Corporation during fiscal 2007 provided an expansion of our life science tools offering with the addition of tools and instrumentation for implementing PCR. PCR is used by scientists studying genetics to amplify or replicate a small amount of DNA to enable further analysis of the genes. Our portfolio of PCR instrumentation, reagents and kits, coupled with our other products such as microarrays and target enrichment systems for next-generation sequencing, provides a broad set of workflow solutions to customers in the genomics marketplace. 
Bioreagents Bioreagents are the primary tools used by scientists in the life science market to interrogate cells, genes and proteins. These bioreagent products are used to conduct a variety of experiments necessary to understand both the form and function of biological entities. The acquisition of Stratagene Corporation provided an expansion of our Life Science tools offering with the addition of a portfolio of reagent products for Nucleic Acid Amplification (PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR), Cloning, Mutagenesis, Cell Biology and other key life science applications. These reagent tools enable us to create a broad set of complete workflow solutions to meet customer needs across our life science markets. 
Lab Automation and Robotics The acquisition of Velocity11 during fiscal 2008 enabled us to offer a more comprehensive suite of workflow solutions to our life science customers with the addition of automated liquid handling and robotics that range from standalone instrumentation to bench-top automation solutions to large, multi-armed robotic systems. These solutions strengthened our offering of automated sample- preparation solutions across a broad range of applications. In fiscal 2009 we continued with our focus on automating laboratory processes by introducing the new Direct Drive Robot and VWorks Automation Control Software. The Direct Drive Robot advances high-throughput screening for drug-discovery research and can also be used in genomics applications, including DNA extraction and PCR sample preparation. 
14 Electrophoresis Products Electrophoresis is used in many scientific and applied disciplines, such as food identification or protein quality control, to separate, quantify, enrich and purify biomolecules which differ in their electrical charge or polarity. Agilent is a world leading supplier of innovative electrophoretic separation solutions. The 2100 Bioanalyzer analyzes biomolecules or cells in microfluidic networks of channels and wells etched into glass chips. The 3100 OFFGEL Fractionator resolves proteins or peptides by isoelectric point with liquid-phase recovery. 
Software and Informatics Products We provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software facilitates the regulatory-compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality control environments. With OpenLab, Agilent has introduced a scalable, open architecture, that enables you to easily capture, analyze, and share scientific data throughout the lab and across the enterprise. 
NMR and MRI systems With the acquisition of Varian in 2010, Agilent has enriched its portfolio with NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), spectrometers, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems and X-ray diffractometers used in a variety of industries including academic and not-for-profit research, life sciences (pharma and biotech), and industrial companies. All of these technologies are utilized for basic and applied research, and NMR is also used in process development and manufacturing QA/QC. 
Consumables and Services We also offer a broad range of consumable products, which support our LC, and MS technology platforms. These consumable products include sample preparation products; self manufactured LC columns, instrument replacement parts, and consumable supplies to meet our customers' analysis needs. All of our products are designed to Agilent's specifications to improve and maximize the performance of our instruments. 
We offer a wide range of startup, operational, educational and compliance support services for our measurement and data handling systems. Our support services include maintenance, troubleshooting, repair and training for all of our chemical and bioinstrumentation analysis hardware and software products. Special service bundles have also been designed to meet the specific application needs of various industries. 
Life Sciences Customers We had over 25,000 customers for our life sciences business in 2010. No single customer represented greater than 2 percent of the net revenue of the life sciences business. A significant number of our life sciences customers are also customers of our chemical analysis business. 
The life sciences business is susceptible to seasonality in its orders and revenues primarily based on U.S. government and large pharmaceutical company budgets. The result is that our first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to deliver the strongest profits for this group. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year. 
Life Sciences Sales, Marketing and Support The life science channel focuses on the therapeutics customer base (Pharma, biotech, CRO, CMO and Generics and on emerging life sciences opportunities in academic and government life science 15 research institutes. We market products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. We use direct sales to market our solutions to all of our pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, telesales, electronic commerce and direct sales. 
We deliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, telephone support and self-diagnostic services provided over the Internet. We also offer special industry-focused service bundles that are designed to meet the specific needs of hydrocarbon processing, environmental, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical customers to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost. 
Life Sciences Manufacturing Our manufacturing supports our diverse product range and customer-centric focus. We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. We selectively use third parties to provide some supply chain processes for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California, Colorado, Texas and Delaware in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Australia, Germany, UK, Poland and Singapore. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing and so typically do not maintain a high level of inventory. 
Life Sciences Competition The markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition. Our principal competitors in the life sciences arena include: Affymetrix Inc., Bruker Corp., Danaher Corporation, Illumina, Inc., Life Technologies Corp., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Waters Corp. Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price. 
Life Sciences Government Regulation The analysis products and related consumables marketed by our life sciences business are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. Therefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, the EPA can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or we could face fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
Agilent Technologies Research Laboratories Agilent Research Laboratories is our central research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with satellite offices in Beijing, China; Leuven, Belgium, and South Queensferry, Scotland. 
16 The Research Laboratories create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent's core businesses and expanding Agilent's measurement footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent's businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value. 
The technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including biology, chemistry, computer science, distributed measurement, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, nano/microfabrication, microfluidics, software, informatics, optics, physics, physiology and signal processing. 
Global Infrastructure Organization We provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. These organizations are generally headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2010, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,200 people worldwide, which includes the Agilent Labs researchers described above. 
The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses. 
Research and Development Research and development ("R&D") expenditures were $612 million in 2010, $642 million in 2009 and $704 million in 2008, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. 
Backlog On October 31, 2010, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately $830 million, as compared to approximately $670 million at October 31, 2009. On October 31, 2010, our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately $250 million, as compared to approximately $160 million at October 31, 2009. Within our life sciences business, our unfilled orders were approximately $350 million on October 31, 2010 as compared to approximately $210 million at October 31, 2009. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately three months' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance. 
Intellectual Property We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage. 
17 Materials Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, chemical analysis and life sciences businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain. 
Environmental Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal, and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future. 
Some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold. 
In addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP's obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters. 
18 We are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future. 
We are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity. 
As part of our acquisition of Varian in 2010, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian's costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("VSEA") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. ("VMS")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. ("VAI") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the "CERCLA sites"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations. 
International Operations Our net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 68 percent in fiscal 2010, 67 percent in fiscal 2009, and 68 percent in fiscal 2008, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were approximately 14 percent in fiscal 2010, 13 percent in fiscal 2009 and 11 percent in fiscal 2008. Approximately 10 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2010, 11 percent in fiscal 2009 and 12 percent in fiscal 2008 was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative. 
Long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 52 percent in fiscal year 2010, 51 percent in fiscal year 2009 and 48 percent in fiscal 19 year 2008. Approximately 13, 16 and 14 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S. 
Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements. 
Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets On May 14, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Varian, Inc., a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications, for a total cash purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. Varian's products include analytical instruments, research products and related software, consumable products, accessories and services, as well as vacuum products and related services and accessories. The acquisition broadens Agilent's applications and solutions offerings in life sciences, environmental, and energy and materials. It also expands Agilent's product portfolio into atomic and molecular spectroscopy; establishes a leading position in nuclear magnetic resonance, imaging and vacuum technologies; and strengthens our consumables portfolio. We financed the purchase price of Varian using the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash. Varian's cash acquired at completion of the acquisition was approximately $226 million.

Item 1A. 
Risk Factors Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results Depressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. In the past two years, the world economy has been suffering an economic downturn, including an extreme disruption in worldwide financial markets beginning in 2008. We are unable to predict the strength and duration of an economic recovery. A continuing, and/or a return to, an economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in: reduced demand for our products and increases in order cancellations; increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories; increased price pressure for our products and services; reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the U.S.; and greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio. 
Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. 
Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to 22 forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, we experienced weakness in almost all sectors during 2009 due to declines in market activity caused largely by the continued global economic downturn. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins. 
The actions that we are taking to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business. 
Since December 2008, we have announced and implemented significant restructuring activities in our global infrastructure organization and our electronic measurement segment. This restructuring program and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost structure, could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases, and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. 
If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer. 
We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to: properly identify customer needs; innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings; price our products competitively; anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and control product quality in our manufacturing process. 
23 Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively. 
As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("IT") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty. 
Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income. 
Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. We are already seeing a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges. 
Our income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products. 
Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income. 
24 Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. 
Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; negative consequences from changes in tax laws; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; differing labor regulations; differing protection of intellectual property; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. 
We centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results. 
In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. These financial institutions, generally, have experienced and continue to experience significant adverse effects on their business from the current decline in general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts. 
Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel. 
Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with 25 reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees, especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts. 
The impact of consolidation of competitors in the electronic measurement and life sciences markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business. 
The electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, in February 2010, Danaher Corporation completed its acquisition of the Life Sciences Instrumentation Businesses from MDS Inc. and Life Technologies Corp. Consolidation in the electronic measurement and life sciences industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us. 
Our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected. 
In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in fiscal 2009, we completed a number of acquisitions and divestitures. In May 2010, we closed our acquisition of Varian, Inc. and the sale of our Network Solutions Division. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions, including the Varian acquisition, and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including: the retention of key employees; the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas; the retention of key customers; the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company. 
In addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause 26 investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital. 
A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to: effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. 
In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted. 
If we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of Varian, Inc., our business and financial condition may be materially impaired. 
We may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of Varian. The acquisition involves the integration of Varian with the rest of our company. If we cannot successfully integrate Varian's operations, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The integration of two businesses that have previously operated separately will be a costly and time-consuming process that will involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to: diversion of senior management's attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations; difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel; the potential loss of key personnel who choose not to join the combined business; the potential loss of key customers who choose not to do business with the combined business; the risk of higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products; difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of facilities, departments, systems, including accounting systems, computer and other technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, including internal accounting controls, procedures and policies; difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies; and the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on integration and implementation activities in excess of our current expectations, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from the Varian acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt. 
27 Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of Varian, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited to: the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected; the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our bio-analytical measurement business, and we may not experience anticipated growth in that market; our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the acquisition or liabilities related to the acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to Varian's products; and the risk that we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements, to the extent that we incur debt to pay for the acquisition. 
As a result of these risks, the Varian acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected cost synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction. 
Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future. 
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. 
We have agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us, other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination. 
Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. 
28 As part of our acquisition of Varian, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian's costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("VSEA") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. ("VMS")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. ("VAI") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the "CERCLA sites"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. 
Our businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. 
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed. 
Some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to 29 pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance. 
We are subject to laws and regulations, and failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with certain customers. 
We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties. 
A number of our products from our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. 
Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. 
From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all. 
Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. 
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results. 
30 Our pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. 
We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property. 
We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly. 
Agilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Agilent's taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives. 
31 Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity. 
At the end of the 2010 fiscal year, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.6 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition. 
We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
We currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion in senior unsecured notes. We also are a party to a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to $330 million. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. 
Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things: increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. 
Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. 
Our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if our long-term leasehold counterparty becomes insolvent and the credit support on the leasehold transaction fails. 
In February 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million in cash. In August 2001, we completed a like-kind exchange by acquiring a long-term leasehold interest in several municipal properties in southern California for a total value of $289 million. In 2002, we received $237 million in non-refundable prepaid rent related to the leasehold interests described above. We contracted with a third party to provide credit protection for certain aspects of the transaction, including a future bankruptcy of the municipality. The current third party insurer is a subsidiary of American International Group Inc. ("AIG") which experienced a credit rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's and has been the recipient of U.S. federal government sponsored loans. If the municipality was to become insolvent and the credit support on 32 the transaction was to fail, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected. 
We have substantial cash requirements in the United States while a majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
Although cash generated in the United States covers normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the satisfaction of our ongoing debt obligations, including our senior notes coming due in September 2012, the repurchases of our stock and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through (1) the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or (2) other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost. 
If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. 
Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.

33 Item 2. 
Properties Our corporate headquarters and Agilent Technologies Research Laboratories are located in Santa Clara, California. In total, with the addition of the Varian Inc. acquisition, we have 30 principle sites. Of these sites, 13 are located in the U.S. and the remaining 17 are located in Australia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom. Many of our primary functions are conducted at multi-building campuses. 
34 * Agilent owns the facilities at these locations but the land is subject to long-term lease from the governments of the respective countries. 
As of October 31, 2010, with the addition of the Varian Inc. acquisition we owned or leased a total of approximately 11.6 million square feet of space worldwide. Of that, we owned approximately 8.7 million square feet and leased the remaining 2.9 million square feet. Our sales and support facilities occupied a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet. Our manufacturing plants, R&D facilities and warehouse and administrative facilities occupied approximately 10.0 million square feet.

Item 3. 
Legal Proceedings In November 2001, a securities class action, Kassin v. Agilent Technologies, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 01-CV-10639, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court") against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ("IPO"), Agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the IPO. In 2003, the Court granted Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims against Agilent based on Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act, but denied Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims based on Section 11 of the Securities Act. On June 14, 2004, papers formalizing a settlement among the plaintiffs, Agilent and more than 200 other issuer defendants and insurers were presented to the Court. Under the proposed settlement, plaintiffs' claims against Agilent and its directors and officers would be released, in exchange for a contingent payment (which, if made, would be paid by Agilent's insurer) and an assignment of certain potential 35 claims. However, class certification of plaintiffs' underlying action against the underwriter defendants was a condition of the settlement. On December 5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Court's order certifying such a class in several "test cases" that had been selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs. On January 5, 2007, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing to the full bench of the Second Circuit. On April 6, 2007, the Second Circuit issued an order denying rehearing but noted that plaintiffs are free to "seek certification of a more modest class." On June 25, 2007, the Court entered an order terminating the proposed settlement between plaintiffs and the issuer defendants based on a stipulation among the parties. Plaintiffs have amended their allegations and filed amended complaints in six "test cases" (none of which involve Agilent). Defendants in these cases have moved to dismiss the amended complaints. On March 26, 2008, the Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. The parties have again reached a global settlement of the litigation and filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on April 2, 2009. Under the settlement, the insurers would pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to Agilent, and Agilent would bear no financial liability. Agilent, as well as the officer and director defendants who were previously dismissed from the action pursuant to tolling agreements, would receive complete dismissals from the case. On October 5, 2009, the Court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement. Certain objectors have appealed the Court's October 5, 2009 order to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. That appeal is pending. 
On August 5, 2009, a putative class action was filed in California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara, entitled Feivel Gottlieb Plan Administrator Feivel Gottlieb Defined Benefit Pension Plan DTD 01-01-04 v. Garry W. Rogerson, et al., No. 1-09-CV-149132. The action was allegedly brought on behalf of a class of shareholders of Varian, Inc. ("Varian") against Varian, its board of directors, Agilent and Cobalt Acquisition Corp. ("Cobalt"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Varian. A similar action, entitled Stuart Kreisberg v. Garry W. Rogerson, et al. 
, No. 1-09-CV-149383, was filed in the same court on August 7, 2009. The actions were subsequently consolidated under the caption In re Varian, Inc. Shareholder Litigation , Lead Case No. 1-09-CV-149132, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on August 14, 2009. The consolidated amended complaint is also filed on behalf of an alleged class of Varian shareholders against Varian, its directors, Agilent and Cobalt. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that Varian's directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed acquisition and asserts, among other things, that the price and other terms are unfair, that Varian's directors have engaged in self-dealing, and that the disclosures in Varian's August 7, 2009 proxy filing are inadequate. Agilent and Cobalt are alleged to have aided and abetted the Varian directors' purported breaches of fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and other relief, including attorneys' fees and costs. On August 19, 2009, another substantially similar putative class action, entitled Hawaii Laborers Pension Fund v. Varian, Inc., et al. 
, No. 1-09-CV-150234, was filed in the same court against Varian, its directors, and Agilent. Like the consolidated amended complaint, it asserts claims on behalf of a class of Varian shareholders, alleges that Varian's directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed acquisition by, inter alia , failing to value Varian properly, agreeing to improper deal terms, engaging in self-dealing and making misleading disclosures, alleges that Agilent aided and abetted those purported breaches of fiduciary duties, and seeks injunctive and other relief (including attorneys' fees and costs). On September 25, 2009, the parties signed a memorandum of understanding to settle the class actions. The settlement provides, among other things, that: (i) Varian would make certain agreed-upon disclosures designed to supplement those contained in its definitive proxy statement filed on August 20, 2009; (ii) the litigation will be dismissed with prejudice as to all defendants; (iii) defendants believe the claims are without merit and continue to deny liability, but agree to settle in order to avoid the potential cost and distraction of continued litigation and to eliminate any risk of any delay to the acquisition; and (iv) plaintiffs' counsel may seek fees and costs of up to $625,000, subject to court approval. There is to be no payment of money to the alleged class members. The Santa Clara Superior Court preliminarily approved the settlement, whereupon the 36 Court notified the class of the settlement. One shareholder objected, but the Court found that the objection was not filed before the deadline set by the Court. After an October 1, 2010 hearing, the Santa Clara Superior Court issued its order providing final approval of the settlement on November 5, 2010. The Court made one change to the proposed settlement; the Court awarded plaintiffs' counsel attorney's fees in the amount of $476,600, rather than the $625,000 they had sought. We are now processing the settlement. 
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Overview and Executive Summary Agilent is the world's premier measurement company, providing core electronic and bio-analytical measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. 
In the first quarter of 2010, we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses. The bio-analytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments life sciences and chemical analysis. The electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test, which were reported separately in 2009. Following this re-organization, Agilent has three businesses life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement. All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements. 
On May 14, 2010, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Varian Inc. ("Varian") under the Merger Agreement, dated July 26, 2009. The results of Varian are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger. As part of the European Commission's merger approval and the Federal Trade Commission consent order, Agilent committed to sell Varian's laboratory gas chromatography ("GC") business; Varian's triple quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ("GC-MS") business; Varian's inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ("ICP-MS") business; and Agilent's micro GC business. On May 19, 2010 we completed the sale of the Varian laboratory GC business, the triple quadrupole GC-MS business, the ICP-MS business and the Agilent micro GC business. 
On May 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the Network Solutions Division ("NSD") of our electronic measurement business to JDS Uniphase Corporation ("JDSU"), a leading communications test and measurement company. NSD includes Agilent's network assurance solutions, network protocol test and drive test products. 
41 On February 2, 2010, the company sold Hycor Biomedical Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to Linden LLC, a Chicago-based healthcare private equity firm. Hycor is a global manufacturer and marketer of in vitro diagnostics products. 
Agilent's total orders in 2010 were $5,744 million, an increase of 28 percent when compared to 2009. The increase in orders associated with the Varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Agilent's total orders in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 as the global economy remained depressed. 
Agilent's net revenue of $5,444 million increased 21 percent when compared to 2009. The revenue increase associated with the Varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and Hycor divestiture, sales of life sciences products into applied and academic and government markets increased strongly and sales into pharmaceutical markets increased more modestly for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year. Excluding the Varian acquisition, sales to all end-markets grew significantly across the chemical analysis business for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Within electronic measurement, general purpose end-markets improved strongly in 2010 when compared to the prior year as a result of the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses. Also within electronic measurement, the communications test businesses improved in the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year with wireless R&D and wireless manufacturing reporting strong revenue growth in the year. Agilent's total net revenue in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 with each of our businesses experiencing a decline in revenue compared to the prior year due to the economic downturn. 
Net income was $684 million in 2010, a net loss of $31 million in 2009 and net income of $693 million in 2008. In 2010, 2009 and 2008 we generated operating cash flows of $718 million, $408 million and $756 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2010 and 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents balances $2,649 million and $2,479 million, respectively. 
Our 2009 restructuring program, the ("FY 2009 Plan"), announced in the first half of 2009, was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle. Workforce reduction payments, primarily severance, were largely complete in fiscal year 2010. Lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014, and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year 2011. As of October 31, 2010, a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan. 
On May 14, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Varian, Inc. ("Varian"), a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and chemical analysis market applications, by means of a merger of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Varian such that Varian became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The $1.5 billion total purchase price of Varian included $52 cash per share of Varian's outstanding common stock including vested and non-vested in-the-money stock options at $52 cash per share less their exercise price. Varian's non-vested restricted stock awards, non-vested performance shares, at 100 percent of target, and non-vested director's stock units were also paid at $52 per share. As part of the European Commission's merger approval and the Federal Trade Commission consent order, Agilent committed to sell Varian's laboratory gas chromatography ("GC") business; Varian's triple quadrupole gas 42 chromatography-mass spectrometry ("GC-MS") business; Varian's inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ("ICP-MS") business; and Agilent's micro GC business. On May 19, 2010 we completed the sale of the Varian laboratory GC business, the triple quadrupole GC-MS business, the ICP-MS business and the Agilent micro GC business for approximately $33 million. We financed the purchase price of Varian using the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash. The Varian merger has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of Varian are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of merger. We expect to realize operational and cost synergies, leverage the existing sales channels and product development resources, and utilize the assembled workforce. The company expects the combined entity to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs. The company also anticipates opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional products and capabilities. For additional details related to the acquisition of Varian, see Note 3, "Acquisition of Varian". 
Looking forward, while the economy remains uncertain, we continue to see numerous market opportunities and we believe Agilent is in a strong position to capitalize on them. We are focused on integrating Varian into Agilent throughout fiscal 2011 and our priority is to continue to drive revenue and cost synergies, as well as drive technology sharing between our businesses. We now believe that we will achieve $100 million in net savings as a result of the integration of Varian into Agilent. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes. 
Revenue recognition. 
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, whether 43 fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. 
Inventory valuation. 
We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. 
Investment impairments. 
We recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our equity and debt securities and our cost-method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
Share-based compensation. 
We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight-line basis. Our estimate of share-based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures and related tax effects. We consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted, which we believe is representative of future behavior. In 2008 we used implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded, similar priced stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards. From 2009, we have moved to historical volatility of Agilent's stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. A 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 38 percent to 48 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 22 percent if no other factors were changed. 
In the first quarter of 2009, we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 4.6 years to 4.4 years. In revising this estimate, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees. In the first quarter of 2009, we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees, on average, exercise their options at 4.4 years. There was no change to the expected life of our employee stock options in 2010. See Note 4, "Share-Based Compensation," to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management 44 judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. 
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. 
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. 
The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2010, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. For 2009, the U.S. discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. 
The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. A one percent change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2010 would result in a $5 million impact on U.S. pension expense and a $16 million impact on non-U.S. pension expense. 
The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were $82 million in 2010, $103 million in 2009, and $15 million in 2008. 
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets. 
Agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. We have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes: life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement. We test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. 
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment, as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which are formed by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization, taking into account an appropriate control premium. We then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair 45 value calculations based on the income approach. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. The assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Changes in these assumptions based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. 
The circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include, but are not limited to, the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test: significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, a portion of a reporting unit's goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value. 
The results of our test for goodwill impairment, as of September 30, 2010, showed that the estimated fair values of our life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement reporting units exceeded their carrying values. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate lowered the fair value by approximately 15 percent. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended October 31, 2010. We continue to assess the overall environment to determine if we would trigger and fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. 
Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In process research and development ("IPR&D") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. 
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We performed impairment analyses of purchased intangible assets in 2010 and recorded $13 million of impairment charges primarily related to a divested business. 
Restructuring and asset impairment charges. 
The four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions, the consolidation of excess facilities, asset impairments and special charges related to inventory. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises. These estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance. We have also assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. 
46 Asset impairments primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell. The charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded. 
Accounting for income taxes. 
We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. 
Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At October 31, 2010, we provided a partial valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets and either a full or partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal in the respective taxing jurisdiction. 
We have not provided for all U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period. 
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. If the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated, a material impact on income tax expense could result. 
Adoption of New Pronouncements See Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements. 
Restructuring Costs, Asset Impairments and Other Charges Our 2009 restructuring program, the ("FY 2009 Plan"), announced in the first half of 2009, was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle. Workforce reduction payments, primarily severance, were largely complete in fiscal year 2010. Lease payments 47 should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014, and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year 2011. As of October 31, 2010, a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan. 
Foreign Currency Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (rolling twelve month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. 
Results from Operations Orders and Net Revenue Agilent's total orders in 2010 were $5,744 million, an increase of 28 percent when compared to 2009. The increase in orders associated with the Varian acquisition less the orders attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of order growth for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Agilent's total orders in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 as the global economy remained depressed. 
Agilent's net revenue of $5,444 million increased 21 percent when compared to 2009. The revenue increase associated with the Varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to our recently divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) accounted for 3 percentage points of revenue increase for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and Hycor divestiture, sales of life sciences products into applied and academic and government markets increased strongly and sales into pharmaceutical markets increased more modestly for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year. Excluding the Varian acquisition, sales 48 to all end-markets grew significantly across the chemical analysis business for the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Within electronic measurement, general purpose end-markets improved strongly in 2010 when compared to the prior year being led by the recovery in the electronics and semiconductor businesses. Also within electronic measurement, the communications test businesses improved in the year ended October 31, 2010 when compared to the prior year with wireless R&D and wireless manufacturing reporting strong revenue growth in the year. For the year ended October 31, 2010 Agilent's segment revenue was $5,463 million, an increase of 22 percent when compared to 2009. Note 21 shows a reconciliation between segment revenue and net revenue. 
Agilent's total net revenue in 2009 decreased 22 percent when compared to 2008 with each of our businesses experiencing a decline in revenue compared to the prior year due to the economic downturn. 
Services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting. Services and other revenue increased 7 percent in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in services and other revenue associated with the Varian acquisition less the revenue attributable to the network solutions divestiture accounted for 1 percentage point of revenue increase in 2010. Services and other revenue decreased 6 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 with service and other revenue showing signs of relative stability compared with product revenue in 2009. 
Backlog On October 31, 2010, our unfilled orders for the life sciences business were approximately $350 million, as compared to approximately $210 million at October 31, 2009. On October 31, 2010, our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately $250 million, as compared to approximately $160 million at October 31, 2009. On October 31, 2010, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately $830 million, as compared to $670 million at October 31, 2009. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately three months' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance. 
Costs and Expenses In 2010, total gross margin increased 3 percentage points in comparison to 2009. The benefits of business and infrastructure programs, lower restructuring costs, together with favorable volume impacts offset the unfavorable impact of the Varian acquisition (including fair value adjustments), 49 wage restoration, higher variable and incentive pay. Operating margins in 2010 increased 9 percentage points as compared to 2009. 
In January 2009, we implemented wage reductions across the company in response to deteriorating economic conditions. Those wage levels were fully restored to all employees effective November 1, 2009. 
Research and development expenditures have decreased 5 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Increases in expenses due to the Varian acquisition, wage restoration, higher variable and incentive pay were more than offset by the impact of the divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses) and decreased restructuring expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent during the year. Increased expenditure was due to the Varian acquisition, higher variable and incentive pay and wage restoration offset by the impact of decreased restructuring expenses and the divested businesses (the network solutions and Hycor businesses). 
Gross inventory charges were $30 million in 2010, $54 million in 2009 and $24 million in 2008. Sales of previously written down inventory were $5 million in 2010, $8 million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008. 
Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. We conduct five types of research and development: basic research, which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future; foundation technologies, which enables fundamental advances across all businesses; communications, which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information; life sciences, which enables next-generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes; and measurement, which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices, digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies; software, systems and solutions such as applied mathematics, knowledge management and measurement science; life sciences such as computational biology, molecular diagnostics and high-throughput measurements; and photonics, such as precision automation technology, optical switching and high-speed optical links. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20,000 products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. Due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense. 
For the year ended October 31, 2010 we recorded a $132 million gain on the sale of our network solutions business and $54 million of income in respect of a tax sharing settlement with Hewlett Packard Company. 
At October 31, 2010, our headcount was approximately 18,500 compared to 16,800 in 2009 and 19,600 in 2008. The increase in our headcount in 2010, compared to 2009, was due to the Varian acquisition. The decrease in our headcount in 2009, compared to 2008, was due to our 2009 restructuring program. 
50 Provision for Income Taxes For 2010, the annual effective tax rate was 1 percent. The 1 percent effective tax rate includes a $101 million beneficial release of the U.K. valuation allowance, a $32 million current year increase in prior year tax reserves, and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Also included is a $17 million tax benefit related to a $54 million non-taxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between Agilent and Hewlett Packard Company. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances. We intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. 
For 2009, the annual effective tax rate was 543 percent. The 543 percent effective tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results. The tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. In addition, net tax benefits totaling $67 million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where we have recorded valuation allowances. 
For 2008, the annual effective tax rate was 15 percent. The 15 percent effective tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the U.S. federal and state valuation allowances which results in U.S. tax expense of nearly zero. It also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Without considering interest and penalties, the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, the U.S., and the U.K. where we have recorded valuation allowances. 
Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $62 million, $14 million and $112 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.18, $0.04 and $0.30 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
During 2003, we established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. During 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2008, we maintained a partial U.S. federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2009 and 2010, we continued to maintain the partial valuation allowances for U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. In 2010, after 51 consideration of all the available positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the U.K. deferred tax assets will be realized and reversed the entire valuation allowance. 
In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. 
On August 31, 2010 we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for tax years 2000 through 2002. The adjustments were offset by applying available net operating losses and had no material impact on our Statement of Operations. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 are under audit by the IRS. In December 2010, we reached an agreement with the IRS for tax years 2003-2005. In addition, Agilent and the IRS reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years 2003-2007. Tax adjustments resulting from these agreements will be offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. 
Global Infrastructure Organization Agilent's global infrastructure organization ("GIO") remains a key component of our operating model. GIO, which includes IT, workplace services, human resources, legal, finance and other corporate functions, has reduced its cost structure over the past year in conjunction with the business restructuring that was completed. We will continue to efficiently manage and leverage our infrastructure resources to support our businesses in the coming year. 
Segment Overview Agilent is a measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences, chemical analysis, communications and electronics industries. Agilent has three primary businesses focused on the life sciences market, the chemical analysis market and the electronic measurement market. 
In the first quarter of 2010, we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses. The bio-analytical measurement segment was separated into two operating segments life sciences and chemical analysis. The electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test, which were reported separately in 2009. Following this re-organization, Agilent has three businesses life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three new operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including technology and delivery channels, consumer-specific solutions and specialized manufacturing, are considered in determining the formation of these new operating segments. 
All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements. 
52 Life Sciences Our life sciences business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products.

Orders and Net Revenue Life sciences orders in 2010 increased 24 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, orders grew 15 percent year over year. Order results were led by strength in the LC, microarray, and automation portfolios, along with consumables and services. This helped to offset soft sales in bio-reagents. We saw solid performance in new products, such as the 1200 Infinity LC Series and SureSelect Target Enrichment System. Growth in consumables was especially driven by sales of LC columns. Geographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, orders grew 15 percent in the Americas, 4 percent in Europe, 12 percent in Japan, and 31 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009, orders declined 6 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy although the business was able to sustain growth in key markets such as academic and government. 
Life sciences revenues in 2010 increased 21 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, revenue grew 14 percent year over year. In addition, foreign currency movements for 2010 had a favorable currency impact of 2 percentage points compared to 2009. Revenue growth was led by the LC, LCMS, informatics, genomics, and consumables portfolios. Geographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and the Hycor divestiture, revenues grew 14 percent in the Americas, 7 percent in Europe, 18 percent in Japan, and 25 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009, revenue declined 3 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy with mixed results across geographies. 
We saw growth in the pharmaceutical and biotech, academic, government, food, and other applied markets. Governments are investing in improving testing capabilities, with growing demand for LC and LCMS technology, along with consumables. In the research space, demand for life science application solutions (genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) is sustained. In the food market, interest in food safety remains with expanding opportunities on functional food testing using metabolomics studies. Other applied markets such as forensics, with interest in LCMS usage, are 53 gaining momentum. Next generation sequencing continues on an aggressive growth path and is capturing a large portion of funding in the genomics field and the SureSelect Target Enrichment System can help our customers improve the cost and process efficiency of next generation sequencing. 
Looking forward, we expect sustained growth in the academic, government, pharmaceutical and biotech markets to drive further demand in our instruments, reagents, application solutions, and consumables products. In our life sciences sales channel coverage model, we are specifically adding capabilities to address life science applications expertise. The life sciences business also remains focused on expanding our application portfolio for our customers. We have a strong line of new product introductions coming to drive further order and revenue growth. 
In addition, our strategic focus is to ensure the successful integration of Varian. With the acquisition of Varian, the life sciences business now has an expanded product portfolio, including complementary products in liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, consumables, new offerings in dissolution testing, and magnetic resonance (NMR, MRI). Revenue synergies are expected with the expansion of our product portfolio and ability to offer new applications and solutions to life sciences customers. Cost synergies will result from leveraging our global infrastructure and our purchasing power. 
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the life sciences business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2010 versus 2009, and 2009 versus 2008. 
Gross margins for products and services in 2010 decreased 1 percentage point compared to 2009. Changes in 2010 were due to the impact of the Varian acquisition, wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay, and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses partially offset by favorable volume impact. Gross margins improved by 1 percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008 as wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and favorable currency movements were partially offset by lower volume and higher discounts. 
Research and development expenses in 2010 increased 9 percent compared to 2009. In addition to an increase related to the Varian acquisition, the increase was due to selective investments in new product introductions, wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay partially offset by lower shared corporate infrastructure expenses and the impact of the Hycor divestiture. Research and development expenses declined 2 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and favorable foreign currency movements partially offset by increase in discretionary spending. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 20 percent compared to 2009. In addition to increases due to the Varian acquisition, increases resulted from the establishment and 54 staffing of the dedicated life sciences sales channel, higher commissions, wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay, and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses partially offset by the impact of the Hycor divestiture. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 3 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and foreign currency movements. 
Operating margins for products and services in 2010 increased 1 percentage point compared to 2009. Operating margins improved by 1 percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008. Factors which led to operating margin variances for these periods are collectively highlighted in the above discussions on gross margins, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Income from Operations Income from operations in 2010 increased by $47 million or 27 percent on a corresponding revenue increase of $260 million. The resultant year-over-year operating margin incremental was 18 percent. Operating margin incremental is measured by the increase in income compared to prior period from operations divided by the increase in revenue compared to the prior period. Income from operations in 2009 increased by $8 million or 5 percent compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of $39 million due to the temporary wage and variable pay reduction. 
Chemical Analysis Our chemical analysis business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Key product categories in chemical analysis include: gas chromatography systems, columns and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry products; spectroscopy products; software and data systems; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies; services and support for the aforementioned products. 
Orders and Net Revenue Chemical analysis orders in 2010 increased 43 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition, orders grew 17 percent year-over-year. Order results were led by solid performance in the gas chromatography ("GC"), gas chromatography mass spectrometry ("GC-MS"), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ("ICP-MS"), and vacuum pump portfolios, along with services and consumables. Growth in the services and support business was driven by strong instrument orders. Geographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition, orders grew 17 percent in the Americas, 9 percent in Europe, 21 percent in Japan, and 25 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009, orders declined 11 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy although the business was able to sustain growth in the food safety and China markets. 
55 Chemical analysis revenues for the 2010 increased 42 percent compared to 2009. Excluding the Varian acquisition, revenue grew 15 percent year-over-year. Revenue growth was led by the GC, GC-MS, ICP-MS, mid-range GC, and vacuum pump portfolios, along with consumables. Geographically, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition, revenues grew 13 percent in the Americas, 8 percent in Europe, 24 percent in Japan, and 21 percent in other Asia Pacific during 2010 when compared to 2009. In 2009 revenue declined 10 percent when compared to 2008, impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy with declines in our main geographies, except for China. 
We saw continued robust growth in the petrochemical, food, and environmental markets. The hydrocarbon processing industry within the petrochemical market is recovering from the recession. The food market remains strong for pesticide, veterinary medicine, and emerging applications worldwide. United States stimulus funding has prompted increased construction projects, leading to growth in air, water, and soil testing. China's government continues to invest in environmental protection and improvement, with emphasis on drinking water quality. European directives continue to be the major business drivers for environmental analysis in both the public and private sector, with emphasis on emissions testing for construction materials. 
Looking forward, we look to strengthen our core business, drive growth, and build upon current success in customer satisfaction. We plan to strengthen our core business by expanding our mid-range portfolio with GC-MS and GC solutions, improving our gross margins, and driving customer intimacy. We intend to drive growth by focusing on the emerging food market and exceptional geographic growth opportunities in China. We also plan to expand our consumables business and high-end mass spectrometry portfolio. 
In addition, our strategic focus is to ensure the successful integration of Varian. With the acquisition of Varian, the chemical analysis product portfolio now has new offerings in spectroscopy and vacuum technologies, complementary mass spectrometry products, and an expanded consumables portfolio. Revenue synergies are expected as a result of the new product portfolio and broader customer and geographic reach. Cost synergies will result from leveraging our global infrastructure and our purchasing power. 
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the chemical analysis business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2010 versus 2009, and 2009 versus 2008. 
Gross margins for products and services in 2010 decreased 1 percentage point compared to 2009. The addition of the Varian portfolio drove the margin decline. Other factors impacting gross margins were higher variable pay and incentive pay, wage restoration, and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses, offset by favorable volume impact and currency movements. Gross margins were relatively flat in 2009 compared to 2008 as lower volume and higher discounts were offset by 56 wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and favorable currency movements. 
Research and development expenses in 2010 increased 36 percent compared to 2009. In addition to an increase related to the Varian acquisition, the increase was due to wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay, higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses, and higher discretionary spending. Research and development expenses declined 8 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower discretionary spending and favorable foreign currency movements. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 increased 52 percent compared to 2009. In addition to increases due to the Varian acquisition, increases resulted from increased commissions, wage restoration, higher variable pay and incentive pay and higher shared corporate infrastructure expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 10 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by wage reductions, lower variable pay, lower global infrastructure costs and foreign currency movements. 
Operating margins for products and services in 2010 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2009. Operating margins were relatively flat in 2009 compared to 2008. Factors which led to operating margin variances for these periods are collectively highlighted in the above discussions on gross margins, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Income from Operations Income from operations in 2010 increased by $63 million or 29 percent on a corresponding revenue increase of $356 million. The resultant year-over-year operating margin incremental was 18 percent. Income from operations in 2009 decreased by $28 million or 12 percent compared to 2008 on a corresponding revenue decrease of $93 million, a 30 percent year-over-year operating margin decremental. 
Electronic Measurement Our electronic measurement business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment, and microscopy products. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle. 
Orders and Net Revenue Electronic measurement orders increased 25 percent in 2010, a significant improvement from the 31 percent decline in 2009 when overall demand was negatively impacted by broad economic 57 weakness. Foreign currency movements had a slightly favorable impact on the year-over-year growth rate. In our general purpose test business, growth was led by improvement in the computers and semiconductor market with solid performance in aerospace and defense and industrial applications. In our communications test business, strengthening wireless R&D and manufacturing related demand was partially offset by a decline in network monitoring associated with the divestiture of the network solutions business. On a geographic basis, 2010 orders increased 14 percent in the Americas, 19 percent in Europe, 29 percent in Japan and 45 percent in other Asia Pacific. Electronic measurement orders declined 31 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, as order trends deteriorated and then improved with the global economic recovery and strengthening demand, particularly in our general purpose segment. 
Electronic measurement revenues grew 15 percent in 2010 compared to a 32 percent decline in 2009 due to a broad-based recovery across both general purpose and communications test markets. Foreign currency movements were slightly favorable, contributing to the year-over-year growth in 2010. Regionally, revenues from the Americas increased 8 percent, Europe grew 12 percent, Japan improved 7 percent and other Asia Pacific increased 32 percent compared to 2009. Revenue from products increased 20 percent year-over-year while service related revenue declined as a result of the divestiture of the network solutions business. Electronic measurement revenues declined 32 percent in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting weakness across general purpose and communications test markets in all geographies. 
General purpose test revenues, representing approximately 64 percent of electronic measurement revenues, reflected strength in the computers and semiconductor business, solid growth in aerospace and defense, and improvement in demand from industrial customers. Strength in the computers and semiconductor business reflected the growing demand for cell phones, computers and electronics. Aerospace and defense business growth was consistent with the focus in the United States on improving information management, with faster growth in surveillance and intelligence, and increased spending in Asia. Overall improvement in economic conditions contributed to more demand from customers with industrial or general purpose applications. General purpose test revenues, representing approximately 63 percent of electronic measurement revenue in 2009, reflected declines across all market segments with steeper declines in the computer and semiconductor and other general purpose test business. 
Communications test revenues, representing approximately 36 percent of electronic measurement revenues, experienced growth in wireless R&D and manufacturing test, offset partially by a decline in network monitoring business resulting from the divestiture of the network solutions business. Wireless R&D grew as market conditions improved and targeted investments increased for high data rate applications, including long-term evolution (an emerging wireless standard). Wireless manufacturing business increased due to strong demand relating to Smartphones and 3G expansion. Performance in other communications test submarket reflected growth in broadband revenues offset by the unfavorable impact of the network solutions divestiture. Communications test revenues, representing approximately 37 percent of electronic measurement revenues in 2009, reflected weakness across all end markets, particularly wireless manufacturing. 
Looking forward, we expect growth rates will moderate as a result of comparisons to stronger 2010 results, particularly for the general purpose test business. We expect continuing demand from our key market segments to support overall growth in the near term, subject to continuing economic expansion and stability in the semiconductor industry. 
58 Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the electronic measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2010 versus 2009 and 2009 versus 2008. 
Gross margins for products and services increased 5 percentage points year-over-year in 2010 due to higher volume, lower cost structure and favorable currency impact. Volume-adjusted gross margins improved relative to 2009 primarily due to savings from restructuring programs, favorable currency impact including hedging gains and lower infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by wage restoration and higher variable pay. Gross margins for products and services declined 4 percentage points year-over-year in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to the significant decline in revenue. 
Research and development expenses in 2010 declined $34 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2009. This decline was driven primarily by savings from restructuring programs, lower infrastructure costs and spending reductions of which a portion related to the network solutions business divestiture that were partially offset by wage restoration, an increase in variable pay and the unfavorable year-over-year impact of currency movements. Research and development expenses in 2009 declined $84 million, or 17 percent, compared to 2008 due to lower variable pay, wage reductions, savings from restructuring, lower infrastructure costs and the favorable year-over-year impact of currency movements, which were offset by higher pension benefit expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 decreased $71 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2009. Similar to R&D, year-over-year reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses were driven by savings from restructuring programs, lower infrastructure costs and reduced spending partly related to the network solutions business divestiture, which were partially offset by wage restoration and higher variable pay, unfavorable year-over-year impact of currency movements and higher commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased $207 million, or 19 percent, compared to 2008 driven by lower variable pay, wage reductions, savings from restructuring, lower infrastructure costs, reduced commissions and the favorable year-over-year impact of currency movements, which were offset by higher pension benefit expenses. 
Operating margins increased by 16 percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the combination of higher revenue volume and structural and operational expense reductions. Operating margins declined by 13 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower revenue volume that was partially offset by spending reductions. 
59 Income from Operations Income from operations increased by $437 million in 2010 compared to 2009 on a revenue increase of $366 million, a 119 percent year-over-year operating margin incremental that reflects the benefit of structural and operational expense reductions. The resultant year-over-year operating margin incremental is expected to moderate going forward as compares are made against relatively stronger 2010 results. Income from operations declined by $476 million in 2009 compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of $1,161 million, a 41 percent year-over-year operating margin decremental as structural and operational expense reductions offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue. 
Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources As of October 31, 2010, approximately 37 percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S. and 40 percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Agilent has accrued for U.S. federal and state tax liabilities on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Repatriation could result in additional U.S. federal and state income tax payments in future years. We utilize a variety of financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. 
Our financial position as of October 31, 2010 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,649 million as compared to $2,479 million as of October 31, 2009. 
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $718 million in 2010 compared to $408 million provided in 2009 mainly due to improved operating results. We paid approximately $48 million in taxes in 2010 as compared to $113 million in the same period in 2009. In 2008, we generated $756 million in net cash provided by operating activities. 
In 2010, accounts receivable used cash of $166 million as compared to cash provided of $193 million in 2009. Days' sales outstanding were 50 days in 2010 as compared to 46 days in 2009. Accounts payable provided cash of $113 million in 2010 as compared to cash used of $7 million in 2009. Cash used in inventory was $51 million in 2010 compared to cash provided of $47 million in 2009. Inventory day's on-hand decreased to 87 days in 2010 compared to 93 days in 2009. 
We contributed $30 million and $37 million to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We contributed $47 million and $71 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We contributed $1 million to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2010 and 2009. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. Total contributions in 2010 were $78 million or 28 percent less than 2009. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We expect to contribute approximately $83 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2011. 
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1,174 million compared to $14 million used in 2009. In 2008, we used $399 million of net cash in the investing activities of operations. 
60 Investments in property, plant and equipment were $121 million in 2010 and $128 million in 2009. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were $7 million in 2010 as compared to $1 million in 2009. In 2010, we invested $1,313 million in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets compared to $2 million in 2009 which was primarily related to our acquisition of Varian. In 2008, we invested $172 million in acquisitions of businesses and purchase of intangible assets. In 2010, we did not purchase any investment securities as compared to $30 million in 2009. Proceeds from the sale of such securities in 2010 were $38 million as compared to $94 million in 2009. Proceeds from divestitures were $205 million in 2010, primarily our network solutions and Hycor businesses, compared to $45 million in 2009. 
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 was $601 million compared to $657 million provided in 2009. In 2008, we used $774 million in financing activities. 
Treasury stock repurchases On November 19, 2009 our Board of Directors approved a share-repurchase program to reduce or eliminate dilution of basic outstanding shares in connection with issuances of stock under the company's equity incentive plans. The share-repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There is no fixed termination date for the new share-repurchase program. For the year ended October 31, 2010 we repurchased 13 million shares for $411 million using settlement date calculation. 
Credit Facility On May 11, 2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on May 11, 2012. On September 8, 2009, we entered into an Accession Agreement, increasing the credit facility from $300 million to $330 million. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2010 the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility. 
Short-term debt We currently hold $1.5 billion of short-term debt (the "World Trade Debt") which was refinanced and the repayment date was extended to January 27, 2011. We satisfied the financing obligation of World Trade in its entirety on December 10, 2010 using the proceeds of our senior notes issued in July 2010 and existing cash on our balance sheet. 
Long-term debt On October 24, 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.60% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on November 1, 2017, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 st and November 1 st of each year and payments commenced on May 1, 2008. 
On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million. The asset value upon termination was approximately $43 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2010 was $35 million. 
On September 9, 2009, Agilent issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $750 million, a $250 million tranche maturing in 2012 (the "2012 notes") and a $500 million tranche maturing in 2015 (the "2015 notes"). The 2012 notes were issued at 99.91% of their principal 61 amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.45% per annum, and mature on September 14, 2012. The 2015 notes were issued at 99.69% of their principal amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per annum, and mature on September 14, 2015. Interest on both tranches is payable semi-annually on March 14th and September 14th of each year, and payments commenced on March 14, 2010. 
On July 13, 2010, Agilent issued two tranches of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $750 million, a $250 million tranche maturing in 2013 (the "2013 notes") and a $500 million tranche maturing in 2020 (the "2020 notes"). The 2013 notes were issued at 99.82% of their principal amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.50% per annum and mature on July 15, 2013. The 2020 notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount, bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum, and mature on July 15, 2020. Interest on both tranches is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year, payments commencing on January 15, 2011. 
Upon the closing of the offering of the 2012, 2015 and 2020 senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps for the full aggregate notional amount of the aforementioned tranches, $1,250 million. Under the interest rate swaps, we will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 253 basis points, 257.6 basis points and 179 basis points with respect to the 2015, 2012 and 2020 senior notes, respectively. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate. The hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness, and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes. At October 31, 2010, the fair value of the swaps was an asset of $61 million with a corresponding increase in carrying value of the senior notes. 
On August 11, 2008, a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, borrowed Indian Rupees equivalent to $15 million from Citibank N.A. to finance a capital project in India. On March 30, 2010 we paid off this debt completely. 
On June 3, 2010, as a result of the Varian acquisition, the company also paid $14 million to satisfy an outstanding term loan of Varian with a U.S. financial institution which had a fixed interest rate of 6.7%. The $14 million payment of the term loan included an early termination fee of $2 million. 
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 17 "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases. 
Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization. 
Contractual Commitments Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors. 
62 The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2010 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Operating leases. 
Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property. 
Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers. 
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 40 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year. 
In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2010, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was $4 million, compared to same amount as of October 31, 2009. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 
Other purchase commitments. 
These relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers. Purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90-day period without significant penalties. 
Retirement Plans. 
Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans. 
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2010 or October 31, 2009. 
63 On Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to long-term debt (in millions): We have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts. Interest rates and payment dates are detailed in "Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities". 
As of October 31, 2010, $430 million of taxes payable are included in other long-term liabilities. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be paid or released. 
64 Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 63 percent of our revenues in 2010, 62 percent of our revenues in 2009 and 65 percent of our revenues in 2008 were generated in U.S. dollars. 
We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2010 and 2009, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
We are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk. The interest rate swaps effectively change our fixed interest rate payments to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based variable interest expense to match the floating interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and other short term investments. By entering into these interest rate swaps we are also hedging the movements in the fair value of the fixed-rate debt on our balance sheet. However, not all of our fixed rate debt's fair value is hedged in this manner, and in the future we may choose to terminate previously executed swaps. 
We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2010, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt. 
65 Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 66 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Agilent Technologies, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions as of November 1, 2007. 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Overview. 
Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. 
Acquisition of Varian, Inc. 
On May 14, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Varian, Inc. ("Varian"), a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and chemical analysis market applications, by means of a merger of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Varian such that Varian became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The $1.5 billion total purchase price of Varian included $52 cash per share of Varian's outstanding common stock including vested and non-vested in-the-money stock options at $52 cash per share less their exercise price. Varian's non-vested restricted stock awards, non-vested performance shares, at 100 percent of target, and non-vested director's stock units were also paid at $52 per share. As part of the European Commission's merger approval and the Federal Trade Commission consent order, Agilent committed to sell Varian's laboratory gas chromatography ("GC") business; Varian's triple quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ("GC-MS") business; Varian's inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ("ICP-MS") business; and Agilent's micro GC business. On May 19, 2010 we completed the sale of the Varian laboratory GC business, the triple quadrupole GC-MS business, the ICP-MS business and the Agilent micro GC business for approximately $33 million. We financed the purchase price of Varian using the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash. The Varian merger has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of Varian are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of merger. We expect to realize operational and cost synergies, leverage the existing sales channels and product development resources, and utilize the assembled workforce. The company expects the combined entity to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs. The company also anticipates opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional products and capabilities. For additional details related to the acquisition of Varian, see Note 3, "Acquisition of Varian". 
Sale of Network Solutions Division. 
On May 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the Network Solutions Division ("NSD") of our electronic measurement business to JDS Uniphase Corporation ("JDSU"), a leading communications test and measurement company. JDSU paid Agilent $160 million and we recorded a net gain on the sale of NSD of $132 million in fiscal 2010. NSD includes Agilent's network assurance solutions, network protocol test and drive test products. The results of operations of NSD were not significant to the income from operations of Agilent for the year ended October 31, 2010. 
Sale of Hycor Biomedical, Inc. 
On February 2, 2010, the company sold Hycor Biomedical Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to Linden LLC, a Chicago-based healthcare private equity firm. Hycor is a global manufacturer and marketer of in vitro diagnostics products. 
Basis of presentation. 
The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. 
73 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and has full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, statement of cash flows and statement of stockholders' equity for all periods presented. 
Reclassifications. 
Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation with no impact on previously reported net income. 
Principles of consolidation. 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Partially owned, non-controlled equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method. 
Use of estimates. 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes. 
Revenue recognition. 
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. 
We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. We consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable, and accordingly we defer revenue until amounts become due. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition. 
Product revenue. 
Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns, when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. 
74 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence. 
Service revenue. 
Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer support, consulting, training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized. 
Multiple element arrangements. 
We use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when delivered elements have stand alone value, fair value of undelivered elements are known and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for the delivered elements. If the criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period(s) over which the last undelivered element is delivered. In the absence of fair value of a delivered element, we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. The price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value. 
Deferred revenue. 
Amounts billed or collected in advance of the period in which the related product or service qualifies for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. 
Accounts receivable, net. 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns. 
Share-based compensation. 
For the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting in accordance with the revised authoritative guidance. Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $66 million in 2010, $71 million in 2009 and $82 million in 2008. 
Inventory. 
Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, 75 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. 
Taxes on income. 
Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. 
Warranty. 
Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue . The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 16, "Guarantees". 
Shipping and handling costs. 
Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented. 
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. 
We review goodwill for impairment annually as of September 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the authoritative guidance. The circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include, but are not limited to, the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail the first step of the goodwill impairment test (as described in the next paragraph): significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, a portion of a reporting unit's goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value. 
The provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. Accordingly, we have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. At the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. For 2010, Agilent had three reporting units, which were the same as our operating segments: life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement. 
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment, as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which are formed by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization, taking into account an 76 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) appropriate control premium. We then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair value calculations based on the income approach noted above. 
If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its goodwill carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value allocated to goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. 
Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In process research and development ("IPR&D") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. 
Advertising. 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $45 million in 2010, $36 million in 2009 and $45 million in 2008 for Agilent operations. 
Research and development. 
Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred. 
Sales Taxes. 
Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue. 
Net income (loss) per share. 
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. In computing diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds of stock option exercises. The number of shares assumed to be purchased also considers the amount of unrecognized compensation cost for future service. As a result of the company's net loss in 2009, the computation of diluted net loss per share for 2009 excludes the diluted impact of all common stock equivalents outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 excluded the potentially dilutive effect of 11 million, 29 million and 7 million options to purchase common stock, respectively, as their effect was antidilutive. 
77 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. 
We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
As of October 31, 2010, approximately 37 percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S. and 40 percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. The remainder is held by other Agilent entities throughout the world. Approximately 12 percent of our overall cash and cash equivalents is maintained in demand deposit accounts with global financial institutions of high credit quality and is available to be used in paying and receiving activities. The remainder is invested in institutional money market funds, short-term bank time deposits and similar short duration instruments with fixed maturities from overnight to three months. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds. 
We classify investments as short-term investments if their original or remaining maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. 
Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $1.6 billion in 2010 and 2009 mostly held in commercial paper. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 
The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. Agilent determines the fair value of short-term and long-term investments in debt securities considering information obtained from independent pricing sources. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. See also Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments. 
Concentration of credit risk. 
Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits, commercial paper and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. Credit evaluation is performed by an independent team to ensure proper segregation of duties. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent or more of combined accounts receivable as of October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Derivative instruments. 
Agilent is exposed to global market exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options and interest rate swaps to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To achieve hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months and interest rate swaps mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions, such as China, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow or net investment hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in accumulated comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Amounts associated with net investment hedges are recognized only when the subsidiary is sold or liquidated. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and qualify for net presentation in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was not significant. 
Property, plant and equipment. 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We currently use the straight-line method to depreciate assets. 
Leases. 
We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from one to fifteen years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to six years. 
79 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Capitalized software. 
We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years once development is complete. 
Impairment of long-lived assets. 
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. 
Employee compensation and benefits. 
Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $ 142 million as of October 31, 2010 and $133 million as of October 31, 2009. 
Foreign currency translation. 
We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. The cumulative translation adjustment balance at October 31, 2010 and 2009 was an unrealized gain of $460 million and $390 million, respectively. 
For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for nonmonetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income (loss). Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, reported in other income (expense), net and were $1 million net loss for both fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and $4 million net gain for fiscal year 2008. 
2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance on measurements of fair value. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allowed for the delay of the effective date of the authoritative guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for certain items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Effective November 1, 2008, we adopted the measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities. The adoption of the guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a material impact on the company's results of operations or the fair values of its financial 80 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) assets and liabilities. We adopted the provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as of November 1, 2009 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In December 2007, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance for business combinations. The revised guidance provides the recognition and measurement requirements of identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. It also requires additional disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. As a result of adopting the amended guidance on November 1, 2009, approximately $6 million of business combination costs, previously capitalized, were recognized in net income for the three months ended January 31, 2010. In process research and development ("IPR&D") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. 
In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on non-controlling interests in consolidated financial statements. The guidance requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, and the amount of consolidated net income, be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires once a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non-controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. Sufficient disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. This guidance was effective beginning November 1, 2009 and had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for gross presentation of activity in level 3 which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods in those years. We adopted the guidance for new disclosures for fair value measurements and clarification for existing disclosure requirements as of February 1, 2010 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when we adopt the guidance for level 3 activity. See Note 12, "Fair Value Measurements" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments. 
In December 2008, the FASB issued amendments to provide guidance on an employer's disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The guidance requires detailed disclosures regarding the investment strategies, fair value measurements, and concentrations of risk of plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 and will be applied prospectively. As required, the company has adopted the guidance effective October 31, 2010 (see Note 15, "Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans"). The adoption of the amendments did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
In October 2009, the FASB amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management's best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor 81 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) specific objective evidence (VSOE), vendor objective evidence (VOE) or third-party evidence (TPE) is unavailable. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Full retrospective application of the guidance is optional. We are still in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance which amends the scope of existing software revenue recognition accounting. Tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the product's essential functionality would be scoped out of the accounting guidance on software and accounted for based on other appropriate revenue recognition guidance. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Full retrospective application of the new guidance is optional. This guidance must be adopted in the same period that we adopt the amended accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables described in the preceding paragraph. We are still in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In April 2010, the FASB issued guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions. The guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements due to the adoption of this guidance. 
3. ACQUISITION OF VARIAN On May 14, 2010, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Varian through the merger of Varian and Cobalt Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent (the "Purchaser") under the Merger Agreement, dated July 26, 2009. As a result of the merger, Varian has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. Accordingly, the results of Varian are included in Agilent's consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger. For the period from May 15, 2010 to October 31, 2010, Varian's net revenue was $320 million. 
The consideration paid was approximately $1,507 million, comprising $52 cash per share of Varian's outstanding common stock. We also paid $17 million to acquire Varian's vested in-the money stock options at $52 cash per share less their exercise price. In addition we paid $12 million for Varian's non-vested in-the-money stock options at $52 cash per share less their exercise price, Varian's non-vested restricted stock awards and non-vested performance shares, at 100 percent of target each at $52 cash per share. In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, settlement of the non-vested awards is considered to be for the performance of post combination services and is therefore stock-based compensation expensed immediately after acquisition. Agilent funded the acquisition using the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash. 
82 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The Varian merger was accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by Agilent at their estimated fair values. Agilent determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by independent third party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices where available, and estimates made by management. We expect to realize operational and cost synergies, leverage the existing sales channels and product development resources, and utilize the assembled workforce. The company expects the combined entity to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs. The company also anticipates opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional products and capabilities. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of Varian's net identifiable assets acquired (see summary of net assets below), and, as a result, we have recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. 
Goodwill acquired was allocated to our operating segments and reporting units as a part of the purchase price allocation. We do not expect the goodwill recognized to be deductible for income tax purposes. Any impairment charges made in the future associated with goodwill will not be tax deductible. 
A portion of the overall purchase price was allocated to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes. Therefore, approximately $138 million was established as a deferred tax liability for the future amortization of these intangibles. 
The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the closing date of May 14, 2010 (in millions): The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities were generally determined using historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 
83 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The fair values for acquired inventory, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, retirement and post-retirement benefits, and deferred revenue were determined with the assistance of valuations performed by independent valuation specialists. 
The fair values of certain other assets, long-term debt, and certain other long-term liabilities were determined internally using discounted cash flow analyses and estimates made by management. 
The company has completed its business combination accounting as of May 14, 2010. 
Valuations of intangible assets acquired The components of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Varian acquisition were as follows (in millions): Acquisition and integration costs directly related to the Varian merger totaled $102 million for the year ended October 31, 2010 and were substantially recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Such costs are expensed in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. 
The following represents pro forma operating results as if Varian had been included in the company's condensed consolidated statements of operations as of the beginning of the fiscal years presented (in millions, except per share amounts): The pro forma financial information assumes that the companies were combined as of November 1, 2009 and 2008 and include business combination accounting effects from the acquisition including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, reduction in revenue and increase in cost of sales due to the respective estimated fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and inventory, decrease to interest income for cash used in the acquisition, increase in interest expense associated with debt issue to fund the acquisition, acquisition related transaction costs and tax related effects. The pro forma information as presented above is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2010 and 2009.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended October 31, 2010 combine the historical results of Agilent for the year ended October 31, 2010 (which include Varian after the acquisition date) and the historical results of Varian for the six months ended April 2, 2010 and the period May 1, 2010 to May 14, 2010. 
The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended October 31, 2009 combine the historical results of Agilent for the year ended October 31, 2009 and the historical results for Varian for the year ended October 2, 2009 (due to differences in reporting periods). 
4. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Agilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the revised accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. 
Description of Share-Based Plans Employee stock purchase plan. 
Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. Prior to November 1, 2008, under the provisions of the ESPP, eligible employees could contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the entry date or the purchase date of each offering period, as defined by the ESPP. Effective November 1, 2008, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors approved a change to our ESPP that eliminated the look back period. The ESPP will continue to allow eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the purchase price, but only uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value. As of October 31, 2010, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 31,384,979. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Agilent on November 1, or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed 75 million shares. 
Incentive compensation plans. 
On November 19, 2008 and March 11, 2009, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the "2009 Stock Plan") to replace the Company's 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Stock Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and subsequently reserved 25 million shares of Company common stock that may be issued under the 2009 Plan, plus any shares forfeited or cancelled under the 1999 Stock Plan. The 2009 Stock Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2009 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2010, 23,937,201 shares were available for future awards under the 2009 Stock Plan. 
Stock options granted under the 2009 Stock Plans may be either "incentive stock options", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant and generally have a maximum 85 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. 
Effective November 1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program under the 1999 and 2009 Stock Plans, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison set at the beginning of the performance period. Based on the performance metrics the final award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years. We consider the dilutive impact of this program in our diluted net income (loss) per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are met. 
In March 2007, we began to issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. 
Impact of Share-Based Compensation Awards We have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the revised authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. 
The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: At October 31, 2010 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory. Income tax benefit recognized in 2010, 2009 and 2008 in the statement of operations for share-based compensation was not material. The weighted average grant date fair value of options, granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9.81, $5.77 and $12.01 per share, respectively. 
Included in the 2010 and 2009 expense is incremental expense for the acceleration of share-based compensation related to the announced workforce reduction plan was $2 million and $5 million respectively. Upon termination of the employees impacted by workforce reduction, the non-vested Agilent awards held by these employees immediately vest. Employees have a period of up to three months in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. In addition, in 2010, we reversed approximately $3 million of expense for the cancellation of non-vested awards related to the separation of a senior executive. 
86 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Valuation Assumptions For all periods presented, the fair value of share based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. As a result of the change in our ESPP effective November 1, 2008, no Black-Scholes assumptions were required in the valuation of awards granted under our current ESPP for 2010 and 2009. For 2008, the value of share-based awards for ESPP awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant. 
The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options granted, ESPP purchases and the LTPP were as follows: Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. For 2010 and 2009 the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of Agilent's stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. For 2008, we used implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded, similarly priced, stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards. Management believes that based on current data historical period estimates of volatility are more appropriate than implied volatility. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered many factors including the limited number of Agilent options currently traded and our limited ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. 
In the first quarter of 2009, we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 4.6 years to 4.4 years. In revising the estimate, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe is representative of future behavior. In the first quarter of 2009, we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the 87 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) review of our data indicated that our executive employees, on average, exercise their options at 4.4 years. There was no change to the expected life of our employee stock options in 2010. 
Share-Based Payment Award Activity Employee Stock Options The following table summarizes employee stock option award activity made to our employees and directors for 2010: The plan shares expired per the above table represent cancelled options granted under the pre-spin Hewlett Packard stock option plan that are not added back to our available for grant options. 
Forfeited and expired options from total cancellations in 2010 were as follows: The options outstanding and exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October 31, 2010 were as follows: 88 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $34.80 at October 29, 2010, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date. The total number of in-the-money awards exercisable at October 31, 2010 was approximately 17 million. 
The following table summarizes the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and the fair value of options granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008: As of October 31, 2010, the unrecognized share-based compensation costs for outstanding stock option awards, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately $10 million which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. The amount of cash received from the exercise of share-based awards granted was $299 million in 2010, $71 million in 2009 and $211 million in 2008. See Note 5, "Provision for Income Taxes" for the tax impact on share-based award exercises. 
Non-vested Awards The following table summarizes non-vested award activity in 2010 primarily for our LTPP and restricted stock unit awards: As of October 31, 2010, the unrecognized share-based compensation costs for non-vested restricted stock awards, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately $37 million which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested was $35 million for 2010, $25 million for 2009 and $40 million for 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 5. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes is comprised of: The income tax provisions do not reflect potential future tax savings resulting from excess deductions associated with our various share-based award plans. 
The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: 90 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The breakdown between current and non-current deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows for the years 2010 and 2009: The consolidated balance sheet reflects the allocation of the valuation allowance based on the pro-rata portion of gross current and non-current deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction where a valuation allowance is required. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. During 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2008, we maintained a partial U.S. federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2009 and 2010, we continued to maintain the partial valuation allowances for U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. In 2010, after consideration of all the available positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it is more likely than not that all of the U.K. deferred tax assets will be realized and reversed the entire valuation allowance. 
At October 31, 2010, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $162 million. The federal net operating losses expire in years beginning 2015 through 2027, and the federal tax credits begin to expire in 2018, if not utilized. At October 31, 2010, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $74 million which expire in years beginning 2013 through 2030, if not utilized. In addition, we had state tax credit carryforwards of $46 million that do not expire. All of the federal and some of the state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. These annual loss limitations may result in the expiration or reduced utilization of the net operating losses. At October 31, 2010, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $510 million. Of this foreign loss, $335 million will expire in years beginning 2011 through 2024, if not utilized. The remaining $175 million has an indefinite life. Some of the foreign losses are subject to annual loss limitation rules.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The authoritative guidance prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits related to stock and stock option plans that have not yet been realized through reduction in income taxes payable. Such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled $161 million as of October 31, 2010 and will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable. 
The differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective tax rate are: The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) earnings before taxes are: For 2010, the annual effective tax rate was 1 percent. The 1 percent effective tax rate includes a $101 million beneficial release of the U.K. valuation allowance, a $32 million current year increase in prior year tax reserves, and tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Also included is a $17 million tax benefit related to a $54 million non-taxable settlement payment received in connection with a tax sharing agreement between Agilent and Hewlett Packard Company. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances. We intend to maintain a partial or full valuation allowances in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. 
For 2009, the annual effective tax rate was 543 percent. The 543 percent effective tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results. The tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. In addition, net tax benefits totaling $67 million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations 92 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where we have recorded valuation allowances. 
For 2008, the annual effective tax rate was 15 percent. The 15 percent effective tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the U.S. federal and state valuation allowances which results in U.S. tax expense of nearly zero. It also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Without considering interest and penalties, the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, the U.S., and the U.K. where we have recorded valuation allowances. 
Agilent records U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. As of October 31, 2010, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings considered permanently reinvested is $3,414 million. The determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings is not practicable. If management decides to remit these permanently reinvested earnings to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period. 
During 2010 Agilent enjoyed tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia, and Switzerland. However, in 2010 Agilent and the Swiss Authorities mutually agreed to exit the Swiss tax holiday. The impact of exiting this agreement does not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. The tax holidays are due for renewal between 2015 and 2023. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $62 million, $14 million and $112 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.18, $0.04 and $0.30 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. 
We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. As of October 31, 2010, we accrued and reported $53.8 million of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.4 million was recognized in 2010. As of October 31, 2009, we accrued and reported $41.1 million of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits of which $(0.2) million was recognized in 2009. 
93 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We adopted the authoritative guidance for uncertain tax positions on November 1, 2007. A 2010 and 2009 rollforward of our uncertain tax positions including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions is as follows: In the U.S., the tax years remain open back to the year 2000. In other major jurisdictions where we conduct business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003. It is reasonably possible that changes to our unrecognized tax benefits could be significant in the next twelve months due to lapses of statutes of limitation and tax audit settlements. As a result of uncertainties regarding the timing of the completion of tax audits in various jurisdictions and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of increase or decrease that could occur in the next twelve months cannot be made. 
On August 31, 2010 we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for tax years 2000 through 2002. The adjustments were offset by applying available net operating losses and had no material impact on our Statement of Operations. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 are under audit by the IRS. In December 2010, we reached an agreement with the IRS for tax years 2003-2005. In addition, Agilent and the IRS reached an agreement on transfer pricing issues covering years 2003-2007. Tax adjustments resulting from these agreements will be offset with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. 
6. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations for the periods presented below. As a result of the company's net loss in 2009, the computation of diluted net loss per share for 2009 excludes the diluted impact of all common stock equivalents outstanding. 
94 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. The total number of share-based awards issued in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 13 million, 5 million and 10 million, respectively. 
The following table presents options to purchase shares of common stock, which were not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share because they were anti-dilutive. 
7. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Cash paid for income taxes was $48 million in 2010, $113 million in 2009 and $210 million in 2008. Cash paid for interest was $89 million in 2010 and $88 million in 2009 and 2008. 
8. INVENTORY Inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges of $30 million, $54 million and $24 million were recorded in total cost of products in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We record excess and obsolete inventory charges for both inventory on our site as well as inventory at our contract manufacturers and suppliers where we have non-cancelable purchase commitments. 
95 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 9. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET Asset impairments other than restructuring were $7 million in 2010 and zero and $1 million 2009 and 2008, respectively. Depreciation expenses were $124 million in 2010, $112 million in 2009 and $126 million in 2008. 
10. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The goodwill balances at October 31, 2010 and 2009 and the movements in 2010 and 2009 for each of our reportable segments are shown in the table below: 96 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The component parts of other intangible assets at October 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown in the table below: In 2010, we recorded $794 million of goodwill primarily relating to the Varian acquisition. The Varian acquisition is fully discussed in Note 3. Goodwill was reduced by $38 million due to divestitures of the network systems business and Hycor during 2010. We recorded $422 million of additions to other intangible assets and recorded $13 million of impairment charges to other intangible assets and reduced other intangible assets by $13 million primarily related to divestiture of the Hycor business. 
In 2009, we recorded $5 million of goodwill primarily relating to the purchase of the remaining unowned portion of a joint venture. Goodwill was reduced by $22 million due to businesses that we divested during 2009 some of which had not been fully integrated into Agilent. We recorded zero additions to other intangibles and recorded $16 million of impairment charges to other intangibles primarily related to divested businesses. 
Amortization of intangible assets was $76 million in 2010, $45 million in 2009, and $53 million in 2008. Future amortization expense related to existing purchased intangible assets is estimated to be $105 million in 2011, $85 million for 2012, $70 million for 2013, $61 million for 2014, $50 million for 2015, and $123 million thereafter.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 11. INVESTMENTS The following table summarizes the company's investments as of October 31, 2010 and 2009 (net book value): Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and two special funds and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity. 
Investments in available-for-sale securities at estimated fair value were as follows as of October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009: All of our investments, excluding trading securities, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
98 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Amounts included in other income (expense) for realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other than temporary impairments were as follows: Net unrealized gains and losses on our trading securities portfolio were $6 million of unrealized gains in 2010, $6 million of unrealized losses in 2009 and $15 million of unrealized losses in 2008. 
Realized gains from the sale of cost method securities were zero for 2010 and $1 million and zero realized gains for 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 
Fair Value Hierarchy The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
99 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2010 were as follows: Our money market funds, trading securities investments, and available-for-sale investments are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our commercial paper and deferred compensation liability are classified as level 2 because although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable. 
Trading securities and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Investments designated as available-for-sale and certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income. 
100 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For assets measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (level 3), the following table summarizes the change in balances during 2010 and 2009: Impairment of Investments. 
All of our investments, excluding trading securities, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. There were no other than temporary impairments for investments during 2010 and we recognized $9 million of other-than-temporary impairments for investments in 2009. Fair values for the impaired investments for 2010 and 2009 were measured using both level 2 and level 3 inputs. 
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non- Recurring Basis Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. 
Long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of $42 million were written down to their fair value of $30 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $12 million, which was included in net income for 2010. Long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying amount of $30 million were written down to their fair value of $16 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $14 million, which was included in net income for 2010. Fair values for the impaired long-lived assets were measured using level 2 inputs. 
13. DERIVATIVES We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, purchased options, and interest rate swaps, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
101 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Fair Value Hedges The company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure of our debt portfolio to interest rate risk. We issue long-term senior notes in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. We use interest rate swaps to modify the market risk exposure in connection with fixed interest rate senior notes to U.S. dollar London inter-bank offered rate ("LIBOR")-based floating interest rate. Alternatively, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest rate or may terminate a previously executed swap. We designate and qualify these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk inherent in the debt. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, we recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in interest expense, in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the swaps is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at each period end, with an offsetting entry in senior notes. As of October 31, 2010, there were 14 interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges associated with our 2012, 2015 and 2020 senior notes. The notional amount of these interest rate swap contracts, receive-fixed/pay-variable, was $1,250 million. On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million. The asset value upon termination was approximately $43 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2010 was $35 million. The proceeds were recorded as operating cash flows and the gain is being deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the 2017 senior notes. 
Cash Flow Hedges The company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. 
Other Hedges Additionally, the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities. 
The company's use of derivative instruments exposes it to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The company does, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. 
102 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) All of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. If our corporate credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. 
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October 31, 2010, was approximately $8 million. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October 31, 2010. 
There were 90 foreign exchange forward contracts and 7 foreign exchange option contracts open as of October 31, 2010 and designated as cash flow hedges. There were 261 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October 31, 2010 not designated as hedging instruments. The aggregated notional amounts by currency and designation as of October 31, 2010 were as follows: Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and qualify for net presentation in the balance sheet. The gross fair values and balance sheet location of derivative 103 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) instruments held in the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009 were as follows: The effect of derivative instruments for interest rate swap contracts and for foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments and not designated as hedging instruments in our consolidated statement of operations were as follows: 104 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The estimated net amount of existing loss at October 31, 2010 that is expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the cost of sales within the next twelve months is $1 million. 
14. RESTRUCTURING COSTS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES Our 2005 restructuring program, announced in the fourth quarter of 2005, is largely complete. The remaining obligations under this and previous plans relate primarily to lease obligations that are expected to be satisfied over approximately the next year. 
Our 2009 restructuring program, the ("FY 2009 Plan"), announced in the first half of 2009, was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and was designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets throughout the cycle. Workforce reduction payments, primarily severance, were largely complete in fiscal year 2010. Lease payments should primarily be complete by the end of fiscal 2014, and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete in fiscal year 2011. As of October 31, 2010, a small number of employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan. 
Special charges in 2009 related to inventory include estimated future payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers in connection with future inventory purchases and inventory on hand written down. In both cases, actions taken under our FY 2009 Plan, including exiting lines of business, have caused the value of this inventory to decrease below its cost. 
A summary of total restructuring activity and other special charges is shown in the table below: The restructuring and other special accruals for all plans, which totaled $35 million at October 31, 2010, are recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These balances reflect estimated future cash outlays. 
105 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the charges/(income) in the consolidated statement of operations resulting from all restructuring plans is shown below: 15. RETIREMENT PLANS AND POST RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS General. 
Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution pension plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits and a death benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan for our eligible U.S. employees. 
Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the retirement plan, defined benefits which are based on an employee's base or target pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under our defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. 
In addition, in the U.S., Agilent maintains the Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan ("SBRP"), a supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the Retirement Plan ("RP") but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the "U.S. Plans". 
As of October 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP for U.S. Agilent Employees was $516 million and $517 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets. 
Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. Our U.S. retirees who retired prior to January 1, 2005, are also covered by a lump sum death benefit that is part of the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan. In July 2004, the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan was revised to eliminate the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit for all U.S. retirees who retire on or after January 1, 2005. See also Plan Amendments below. 
401(k) defined contribution plan. 
Eligible U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Enrollment in the 401(k) Plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. Under the 401(k) Plan, we provide matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 4 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation. The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan expense 106 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) included in income from operations was $21 million in 2010, $23 million in 2009 and $26 million in 2008. 
Post-retirement medical benefit plans. 
In addition to receiving pension benefits, our U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in our Non-Medicare Medical Plan, and if eligible, the Medicare Medical Plan under the Agilent Health Plan. These two plans are the Post-Retirement Benefit Plans. Current U.S. employees may become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. Eligible retirees may choose from managed-care and indemnity options, with the company subsidization level dependent on a number of factors including employment status as of January 1, 2005, the option chosen, and length of service. 
Plan Amendments. 
On July 14, 2009 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved design changes to Agilent's U.S. Plans. Effective October 31, 2009, benefits under the previous U.S. Plans formula were frozen and all future benefit accruals for existing employees and new hires are calculated using the new formula. The new formula allocates a percentage of each month's eligible earnings to be payable as a lump sum at age 65 whereas the previous formula defined a monthly annuity payable at age 65. In addition, effective November 1, 2009, the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan was discontinued. 
Due to these plan amendments, we recorded gains of $117 million and $15 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2009 for the U.S. Plans and U.S. post retirement benefit plans, respectively. 
Components of net periodic cost. 
The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. For the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our net pension and post-retirement benefit costs were comprised of: In 2009, as a result of reductions in workforce, we recorded a $3 million curtailment gain and a $13 million curtailment gain in the income statement for the Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, respectively. 
107 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In 2010, due to reductions in workforce which impacted two non-U.S. plans, we recorded curtailment losses as required by authoritative guidance with no impact to the income statement. 
Funded status. 
As of October 31, 2010 and 2009, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: 108 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net expense during 2011 are as follows: Investment policies and strategies as of October 31, 2010 and 2009. 
In the U.S., our Agilent Retirement Plan and post-retirement benefit target asset allocations are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately, 5 percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. The safety and protection of principal is a primary concern, and we believe that a well-diversified investment portfolio will result in the highest attainable investment return (income plus capital appreciation) with the lowest overall risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation is from 45 to 60 percent to equities, from 40 to 55 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 10 percent to real estate investments, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2010 and 2009 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation. 
Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships as well as other investments. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds. 
Fair Value. 
The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 12. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments except when the cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds, which have a daily net value derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 2 investments. 
Equity Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 2 investments. 
109 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Fixed Income Some of the fixed income securities are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 2 investments. 
Other Investments Due to the private nature of the partnership investments, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships.

Assumptions. 
The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans October 31. For the non-U.S. plans, the measurement date was September 30 for 2008. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2010 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2009 were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve as well as reviewing the movement of industry benchmarks. The non-U.S. rates were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.

GUARANTEES Standard Warranty A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities. 
Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that it might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2010. 
Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against certain damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June 1, 2006. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2010. 
115 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Indemnifications to Hewlett-Packard We have given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP for the businesses that constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. These indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property and environmental matters. The agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on Form S-1 filed on August 16, 1999. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2010. 
Indemnifications to Varian Medical Systems and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates In connection with our acquisition of Varian, we are subject to certain indemnification obligations to Varian Medical Systems (formerly Varian Associates, Inc. ("VAI")) and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates in connection with the Instruments business as conducted by VAI prior to the Distribution (as described in Note 1 of Varian's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on November 25, 2009). These indemnification obligations cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property, litigation and environmental matters. Certain of the agreements containing these indemnification obligations are disclosed as exhibits to Varian's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on November 25, 2009. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2010. 
Indemnifications to Officers and Directors Our corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these obligations was not material as of October 31, 2010. 
Other Indemnifications As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In 116 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2010. 
In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October 31, 2010. 
17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Lease Commitments: We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at October 31, 2010 were $57 million for 2011, $47 million for 2012, $30 million for 2013, $19 million for 2014, $17 million for 2015 and $31 million thereafter. Future minimum sublease income under leases at October 31, 2010 was $6 million for 2011, $5 million for 2012, $3 million for 2013, $2 million for 2014 and $3 million thereafter. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense, including charges relating to the consolidation of excess facilities was $89 million in 2010, $95 million in 2009 and $89 million in 2008. 
Environmental Contingency: As part of our acquisition of Varian, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian's costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("VSEA") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. ("VMS")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance recoveries and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by VAI and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the "CERCLA sites"). 
Various uncertainties make it difficult to estimate future costs for certain of these environmental-related activities, specifically external legal expenses, VMS' internal oversight costs, third-party claims and a former VAI facility where the likelihood and scope of further environmental-related activities are difficult to assess. As of October 31, 2010, it was nonetheless estimated that our future exposure for these environmental-related costs ranged in the aggregate from $1 million to $3 million. 
117 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate other costs for future environmental-related activities. As of October 31, 2010, it was estimated that our future costs for these environmental-related activities ranged in the aggregate from $2 million to $13 million. As to each of these ranges of cost estimates, it was determined that a particular amount within the range was a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Together, these amounts totaled $5 million at October 31, 2010. Because both the amount and timing of the recurring portion of these costs were reliably determinable, that portion is discounted at 4%, net of inflation. As of October 31, 2010, in total, we have accrued $5 million in respect of these environmental matters. 
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including patent, commercial and environmental matters. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
18. SHORT-TERM DEBT Credit Facility On May 11, 2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on May 11, 2012. On September 8, 2009, we entered into an Accession Agreement, increasing the credit facility from $300 million to $330 million. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2010 the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility. 
On August 17, 2009 the credit facility agreement was amended to provide additional financing flexibility in advance of the acquisition of Varian, Inc. The amendment allows for up to $1 billion of additional indebtedness, incurred during the period from August 17, 2009 through the closing of the acquisition, May 14, 2010, to be excluded from the leverage ratio covenant until March 1, 2011. It also temporarily reduces the basket for other secured financing we are permitted to incur from $300 million to $75 million during this period. The amendment also increases by $500 million the amount of repurchase obligations (such as those of Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc., a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent ("World Trade")), that we are permitted to incur. 
World Trade Debt In January 2006, World Trade entered into a five-year Master Repurchase Agreement with a counterparty in which World Trade sold 15,000 Class A preferred shares of Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited ("Cayco") to the counterparty, having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion. World Trade owns all of the outstanding common shares of Cayco, a separate legal entity. 
In September 2008, Agilent and World Trade entered into an agreement (the "Lloyds Related Agreement") with Lloyds TSB Bank plc ("Lloyds"). Under the Lloyds Related Agreement, on November 17, 2008 (the "Effective Date"), Lloyds accepted the transfer by novation of all of the rights and obligations of the counterparty under a revised Master Repurchase Agreement. On the Effective Date, Lloyds paid $1.5 billion to the prior counterparty in consideration of the novation and World Trade's repurchase obligation was extended to January 27, 2011 (the "Extended Repurchase Date"). World Trade is obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to Lloyds at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, with reference to LIBOR plus 175 basis points beginning on the Effective Date. We satisfied the financing obligation of World Trade in its entirety on December 10, 2010 using the proceeds of our senior notes issued in July 2010 and existing cash on our balance sheet. 
118 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Short-Term Restricted Cash & Cash Equivalents As of October 31, 2010, $1,550 million was reported as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet which is held in commercial paper maintained in connection with our World Trade repurchase obligation. This restricted cash, held by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, has been reclassified to cash and cash equivalents following the December 10, 2010 settlement of the World Trade repurchase obligation. As of October 31, 2009, $1,555 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents associated with our World Trade repurchase obligation was reported as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet. 
19. LONG-TERM DEBT Senior Notes The following table summarizes the company's senior notes and the related interest rate swaps: 2012 Senior Notes In September 2009, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $250 million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.91% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 14, 2012, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.45% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 14 th and September 14 th of each year, payments commenced on March 14, 2010. 
2013 Senior Notes In July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $250 million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.82% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2013, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15 th and July 15 th of each year, payments commencing on January 15, 2011. 
2015 Senior Notes In September 2009, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.69% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 14, 2015, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 14 th and September 14 th of each year, payments commenced on March 14, 2010. 
119 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2017 Senior Notes In October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.60% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on November 1, 2017, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 st and November 1 st of each year and payments commenced on May 1, 2008. 
On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million. The asset value upon termination was approximately $43 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2010 was $35 million. The proceeds were recorded as operating cash flows and the gain is being deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the senior notes. 
2020 Senior Notes In July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15 th and July 15 th of each year, payments commencing on January 15, 2011. 
All notes issued are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of Agilent's other senior unsecured indebtedness. The company incurred issuance costs of $5 million in connection with the 2017 senior notes, incurred $5 million in connection with the 2015 and 2012 senior notes and incurred $5 million in connection with 2013 and 2020 senior notes. These costs were capitalized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and the costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes. 
Upon the closing of the offering of the 2015 and 2012 senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $750 million. Also concurrent with issuing the 2020 senior notes in July 2010, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. Under the interest rate swaps, we will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 253 basis points, 257.6 basis points and 179 basis points with respect to the 2015, 2012 and 2020 senior notes, respectively. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate. The hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness, and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes. At October 31, 2010, the fair value of the swaps on 2015 and 2012 senior notes was an asset of $43 million and an asset of $18 million on 2020 senior notes with a corresponding increase in carrying value of the senior notes. 
Other Debt On August 11, 2008, a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, borrowed Indian Rupees equivalent to $15 million from Citibank N.A. to finance a capital project in India. On March 30, 2010 the debt was repaid in full. 
On June 3, 2010, as a result of the Varian acquisition, the company also paid $14 million to satisfy an outstanding term loan of Varian with a U.S. financial institution which had a fixed interest rate of 6.7%. The $14 million payment of the term loan included an early termination fee of $2 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 20. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On November 14, 2007, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion of Agilent's common stock over the next two years. On March 26, 2009, the company announced that it was suspending its share repurchase program until the end of the 2009 fiscal year. On November 15, 2009, the company's share repurchase program expired upon the termination of its two-year term. No shares were purchased under the November 14, 2007 share repurchase program during the year ended October 31, 2010. 
On November 19, 2009 our Board of Directors approved a share-repurchase program to reduce or eliminate dilution of basic outstanding shares in connection with issuances of stock under the company's equity incentive plans. The share-repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There is no fixed termination date for the new share-repurchase program. For the year ended October 31, 2010, we repurchased 13 million shares for $411 million using settlement date calculation. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. 
21. SEGMENT INFORMATION Description of segments. 
We are a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences, chemical analysis, communications and electronics industries. In the first quarter of 2010, we formed three new operating segments from our existing businesses. The bio-analytical measurement segment separated into two operating segments life sciences and chemical analysis. The electronic measurement segment recombined electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test, which were reported separately in 2009. Following this re-organization, Agilent has three businesses life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement each of which comprises a reportable segment. The three new operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these new operating segments. All historical segment numbers were recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements. 
A description of our three reportable segments is as follows: Our life sciences business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Key product categories in life sciences include: DNA and RNA microarrays and associated scanner, software, and reagents; microfluidics-based sample analysis systems; liquid chromatography (LC) systems, columns and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) systems; capillary electrophoresis systems; laboratory software and informatics systems; bio-reagents and related products; laboratory automation and robotic systems, dissolution testing; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems along with X-Ray Crystallography, and services and support for the aforementioned products. 
121 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Our chemical analysis business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Key product categories in chemical analysis include: gas chromatography systems, columns and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry products; spectroscopy products; software and data systems; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies; services and support for the aforementioned products. 
Our electronic measurement business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment, and microscopy products. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle. 
A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include costs of centralized research and development, legal, accounting, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. 
The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. These results are not necessarily in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including adjusted income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments. 
The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, Varian 122 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Under the terms of the 423(b) Plan, in no event shall the aggregate number of shares issued under the Plan exceed 75 million shares. The number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights in column (a) does not include shares of common stock issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participant contributions under the 423(b) Plan totaling $20 million as of October 31, 2010. 
(2) We issue securities under our equity compensation plans in forms other than options, warrants or rights. On November 19, 2008 and March 11, 2009, the Board and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the "2009 Plan") to replace the company's 1999 Plan and 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan for awards of stock-based incentive compensation to our employees (including officers), directors and consultants. The 2009 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions to vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2009 Plan has a term of ten years. 
(3) We issue securities under our equity compensation plans in forms which do not require a payment by the recipient to us at the time of exercise or vesting, including restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units. Accordingly, the weighted-average exercise price in column (b) does not take these awards into account.
