 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the anticipated completion of transactions and our liquidity position that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to certain factors, including those discussed below in "Factors That May Affect Future Results" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

OVERVIEW On March 2, 1999, Hewlett-Packard Company (Hewlett-Packard) announced a plan to create a separate company, subsequently named Agilent Technologies, that comprised Hewlett-Packard's test and measurement, semiconductor products, healthcare solutions and chemical analysis businesses, related portions of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, and associated infrastructure. On November 1, 1999, we began operating as a separate, stand-alone company. On November 18, 1999, we launched our initial public offering of 72,000,000 shares of common stock at $30 per share. After the completion of our initial public offering in November 1999, Hewlett-Packard owned approximately 84.1% of our outstanding common stock. On November 23, 1999, we paid the net proceeds of the offering of $2.1 billion to Hewlett-Packard as a dividend. On April 7, 2000, Hewlett-Packard announced that its board of directors had declared a stock dividend of all of Hewlett-Packard's shares in us. The dividend was distributed on June 2, 2000 to Hewlett-Packard shareholders of record as of May 2, 2000. The distribution was made on the basis of 0.3814 of an Agilent share for each Hewlett-Packard common share outstanding. 

We were incorporated in Delaware in May 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard. Our businesses historically were operated as internal units of Hewlett-Packard. In November 1999, Hewlett-Packard transferred to us a majority of the assets and liabilities relating to our businesses and also provided us with cash funding of approximately $1.1 billion. Hewlett-Packard retained some of our assets and liabilities including our accounts receivable and accounts payable, accrued payroll and related items and taxes payable, except deferred taxes, and transferred to us some of the assets and liabilities related to its business, including some of the accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities of Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. (formerly Hewlett-Packard Japan, Ltd.). In addition, Hewlett-Packard transferred to us $521 million to fund our acquisition of Yokogawa Electric Corporation's 25% minority equity ownership of Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. In December 1999, Hewlett-Packard provided us with additional cash funding of approximately $200 million based on our and Hewlett-Packard's balance sheets as of October 31, 1999. 

We have entered into various agreements with Hewlett-Packard related to certain ongoing relationships between the companies. In addition, we have entered into agreements with Hewlett-Packard under which Hewlett-Packard will provide services to us during a transition period which began November 1, 1999. 

For a brief description of these agreements, see Note 14, "Transactions with Hewlett-Packard," of the consolidated financial statements. The agreements relate primarily to information technology, customer financing, accounting and administrative, and building services. Under these agreements, we reimburse Hewlett-Packard for its cost of the service plus 5%. The transition period varies depending on the agreement but is generally less than two years. Some of the agreements, including those for building services and information technology services, may be extended beyond the initial transition period. If these agreements are extended, we will reimburse Hewlett-Packard at its cost plus 10% for information technology services and most other services and at negotiated market rates for building services. The agreements do not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing the applicable services ourselves. However, we believe that purchasing these services from Hewlett-Packard provides us with an efficient means of obtaining these services during the transition period. In addition, we provide some transition services to Hewlett-Packard, for which we are reimbursed at our cost plus 5%. 

30 33 Basis of Presentation Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. 

The 2000 consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, changes in cash flows, and the financial position of our businesses. 

We began accumulating retained earnings on November 1, 1999. 

The 1999 and 1998 consolidated financial statements were prepared using Hewlett-Packard's historical bases in the assets and liabilities and our historical results of operations. The 1999 and 1998 consolidated financial statements include allocations of certain Hewlett-Packard corporate expenses, including centralized research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other Hewlett-Packard corporate and infrastructure costs. The expense allocations were determined on bases that Hewlett-Packard and we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to us or the benefit received by us. Therefore, the financial information presented in this Financial Report for 1999 and 1998 is not indicative of our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in subsequent periods nor is it necessarily indicative of what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate, stand-alone entity in those periods prior to 2000. 

Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges In August 2000, we announced a restructuring of our healthcare solutions business. The restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction through severance programs, as well as consolidation of our business operations. Since the announcement, 396 regular employees located in the United States, Asia Pacific and Europe have accepted severance packages and 200 temporary employees have been terminated. We recognized a $21 million pre-tax restructuring charge comprised of $13 million for estimated severance benefits and $8 million for non-cash asset writedowns. Of this amount, $11 million was included in cost of products, $4 million in cost of services and other. The remainder was included in other operating expense line items. As of October 31, 2000, $2 million in severance benefits has been paid and charged against the liability. The reminder of the liability is expected to be utilized during 2001. 

In 1999, we recognized an impairment loss of $51 million related to a building that was under construction for the intended purpose of housing manufacturing operations for eight-inch CMOS semiconductor wafers. At the time construction was stopped, only the building shell was complete. After exhaustive efforts to find a semiconductor manufacturing partner to utilize the building for its initial intended use, management concluded that the highest fair value to be realized from this building was based on selling it for use as an office or general use facility. In 2000, we actively marketed the building shell without success. In late 2000, in response to the increased demand in the wireless semiconductor market and our need to increase gallium arsenide (GaAs) manufacturing capacity, management decided to resume construction of a portion of the building shell. When completed, this portion of the building will manufacture six-inch GaAs semiconductor wafers. We anticipate that the completed manufacturing facility will be put into service sometime in 2002, at which time depreciation will commence. 

During 1998, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $163 million related to the transfer of the production of certain semiconductor wafers to a third-party contractor. Of this amount, $138 million was included in cost of products, $7 million in research and development and $18 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in this charge was $85 million for non-cash asset writedowns of equipment that was subsequently abandoned or sold. 

Also included in this charge was $78 million for employee severance benefits that have been paid. 

Also during 1998, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $37 million for the writedown of an investment in convertible preferred stock of a medical products company to its fair value because management had determined the impairment was not temporary. 

Sale of leasing portfolio to CIT In the fourth quarter of 2000, we entered into a vendor financing agreement with The CIT Group, Inc. (CIT), whereby CIT will provide equipment financing and leasing services to our customers on a global basis. 

31 34 Under the terms of the agreement, CIT established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Financial Services, Inc. (AFS), and is offering financing products to our customers under this name. CIT, through AFS, will be providing funding and services related to equipment financing to customers in most of our businesses. 

These services include credit review, document generation, pricing, invoicing and collections. We also entered into an asset purchase agreement with CIT pursuant to which we sold them certain portions of our U.S. portfolio of lease assets during the fourth quarter of 2000. Net proceeds from this sales transaction were $234 million and we recognized $212 million in net revenue and $89 million in cost of products. We will be selling additional portions of our portfolio of lease assets to CIT during 2001 pursuant to various asset purchase agreements. 

Sale of healthcare solutions business to Philips In the first quarter of 2001, we agreed to sell our healthcare solutions business to Koninklijke Philips Electronics, N.V. (Philips) for approximately $1.7 billion. Most of our healthcare solutions business' operational facilities and certain associated assets and liabilities will transfer to Philips. 

Virtually all employees of our healthcare solutions business, including 100 percent of the healthcare solutions business-dedicated infrastructure employees, will be offered employment by Philips or transferred to Philips, subject to local statutory laws. The estimated amount of net assets to be transferred is $400 million. We will be restricted from competing in the development, manufacturing, selling or servicing of certain medical products for five years. 

The sale is expected to be completed by mid-calendar year 2001 subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. 

Acquisition of OSI On January 5, 2001, we acquired Objective Systems Integrators, Inc. (OSI) for approximately $684 million in cash. OSI is a leading provider of next-generation operations-support-system software for communications service providers and will become part of our test and measurement business. 

Cyclical Business and General Economic Conditions The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. Shifts in the semiconductor market, electronics industry, computer industry and telecommunications markets, as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions, have had significant impacts on our businesses. In portions of some of these markets, we have started to see softening which could harm our businesses. Our revenue and operating results for 2000 compared to 1999 have improved as a result of an upturn in the semiconductor industry. 

Additionally, as a capital equipment provider, our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their businesses and in the economy. We expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the future. Given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed, variability in revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our quarterly and annual results. 

Economic Conditions in Asia Beginning in the second half of 1998 and continuing into the first half of 1999, our revenue and operating results declined as a result of the downturn in Asian economies, particularly in Korea and Japan. Many of our major customers, particularly those in the semiconductor and electronics industries, delayed or canceled purchases of our products. This had a significant impact on us, particularly our test and measurement business. These conditions began to improve in the second half of 1999 and, accordingly, our revenue and operating results improved. 

Impact of Foreign Currencies We sell our products in many countries and a portion of our sales and a portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, especially in the Japanese yen and the Euro. In 2000 compared to 1999, the U.S. 

dollar strengthened against both the Japanese yen and the Euro, which had an immaterial 32 35 effect on our net revenue and operating expense growth. Our foreign currency exposures are hedged as part of our global risk management program, which is designed to minimize exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133). This statement, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We expect the adoption of FAS 133, during first quarter of 2001, will result in a cumulative after tax expense of $26 million. Additionally, an unrealized gain related to foreign currency hedging of approximately $7 million, net of tax, will be recorded in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet. 

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." This Staff Accounting Bulletin, as amended, is effective no later than the fourth quarter of 2001. We currently do not believe the adoption will have a material annual impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of operations for the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue follow. 

Net revenue Total net revenue increased 29.3 percent to $10.8 billion in 2000 from 1999 and 4.8 percent to $8.3 billion in 1999 from 1998. Excluding the sale of certain portions of our U.S. portfolio of lease assets to CIT, net 33 36 revenue increased 26.8 percent in 2000 from 1999. The increase in 2000 was spurred by continued growth in net revenue from the communications and electronics markets. This was especially due to the robust demand for our test and measurement and semiconductor products, more specifically for our wireless, fiber-optics, networking and imaging components. Increased demand in Asia also contributed to net revenue growth in 2000. These effects were partially offset by a decline in net revenue from our healthcare solutions business. Net revenue for 2000 from our chemical analysis business was essentially flat. The increase in 1999 compared to 1998 was primarily due to growth in the communications market, improvement in economic conditions in Asia and strengthening of the semiconductor industry in general. 

United States revenue increased 27.6 percent to $4.8 billion in 2000 and increased 3.1 percent to $3.7 billion in 1999. International revenue increased 30.7 percent to $6.0 billion in 2000 and increased 6.2 percent to $4.6 billion in 1999. Domestic growth came primarily from our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets which was partially offset by a slowdown in our healthcare solutions business. The relatively higher net revenue growth internationally was primarily attributable to increased demand in Asia, particularly in Taiwan, Korea and Japan. There was minimal currency impact on net revenue growth in 2000. In the last half of 1998 and the first half of 1999, economic conditions in Asia adversely affected revenue from sales of our products and services to customers in Korea and Japan. In addition, global weakness in the semiconductor industry caused our product revenue to decline in 1998 and into the first half of 1999. These conditions began to improve in the second half of 1999 and, accordingly, our revenue improved, both within the United States and internationally. 

In 2000 compared to 1999, revenue from products increased 32.3 percent while revenue from services and other increased 11.9 percent. In 1999 compared to 1998, revenue from products increased 3.2 percent while revenue from services and other increased 14.7 percent. The relatively higher product revenue growth in 2000 was primarily due to growth in our businesses which serve the communications and electronics markets, a strengthening of the semiconductor industry and increased demand in Asia. Generally, there is a lag between service revenue growth and product revenue growth. This lag occurs because service revenue increases as our installed base of products increases and warranty periods expire. Lower product revenue growth in 1999 was primarily due to weak economic conditions in Asia and weak demand in the semiconductor industry. 

Earnings from operations Earnings from operations increased 42.1 percent to $1.1 billion in 2000 from 1999 and increased 67.6 percent to $741 million in 1999 from 1998. 

Excluding the sale of certain portions of our U.S. portfolio of lease assets to CIT and the restructuring charges related to our healthcare solutions business, earnings from operations increased 28.3 percent in 2000 from 1999. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to strong results in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses. These improved results were partially offset by weak performance from our healthcare solutions business, flat performance from our chemical analysis business, additional on-going costs associated with operating on our own and previously planned research and development in the life sciences. The increase in 1999 was due to higher net revenue combined with cost savings of approximately $80 million as a result of the 1998 restructuring. 

Also, 1999 results included a $51 million asset impairment charge related to a building under construction for the intended purpose of housing manufacturing operations for eight-inch CMOS semiconductor wafers. 

As a percentage of net revenue, cost of products and services decreased 1.5 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 4.0 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. Excluding the sale of certain portions of our U.S. portfolio of lease assets to CIT and the 1999 impairment charge of $51 million, cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.6 percentage points in 2000 from 1999. The decrease in 2000 was primarily attributable to higher volumes in the test and measurement and semiconductor products businesses as well as a more profitable product mix in the semiconductor products business. 

The decrease was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies related to parts shortages, manufacturing consolidations and our healthcare solutions business restructuring charges. In 1999, all four of our business segments recorded improvement in cost of products and services and other as a percentage of net revenue with semiconductor products accounting for the most significant improvement due primarily to cost improvements resulting from the 1998 restructuring. 

34 37 Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.6 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and 0.7 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own and higher marketing costs. The increase in 1999 was due to higher advertising and branding expenses related to our becoming an independent company. This effect was partially offset by higher net revenue. 

Research and development expenses increased 26.2 percent in 2000 compared to 1999 and 5.2 percent in 1999 compared to 1998. These increases reflect ongoing efforts in developing new products and new technologies for the wireless, networking and life sciences markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 33.3 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 7.6 percent in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own as well as higher marketing costs, including branding expenses. Also, goodwill amortization related to recent acquisitions contributed to the increase in operating expenses in 2000. 

In 1999, expense reductions resulting from the 1998 restructuring and other cost containment measures were offset by costs, including product advertising and branding expenses, related to our becoming a stand-alone entity. 

Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, increased $65 million to $111 million in 2000 from $46 million in 1999. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to approximately $29 million of gain on sales of equity investments that no longer supported our business strategies and interest income earned on the initial cash funding received from Hewlett-Packard. Included in 1999 were gains of $54 million related to the divestiture of several portions of our businesses. 

Provision for taxes As a result of the impacts of the anticipated sale of our healthcare solutions business, the acquisition of OSI and possible changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings, our 2001 effective tax rate may change. Our future effective tax rates will also continue to be subject to the impacts of business acquisitions and dispositions, as well as changes in the mix of our pre-tax earnings among jurisdictions with varying statutory rates. 

TEST AND MEASUREMENT Net revenue Net revenue from our test and measurement business increased 49.6 percent to $6.1 billion in 2000 from 1999 and remained essentially unchanged in 1999 from 1998. Excluding the sale of our U.S. portfolio of lease assets to CIT, net revenue increased 44.9 percent in 2000 from 1999. The increase in 2000 was attributable to strong growth in the sales of our products into the optical, wireless and networking markets. Also, third-party manufacturing contractors added capacity to meet demand and increased their purchases of our test and measurement products. Net revenue growth in 1999 was negatively affected by weakness in the semiconductor industry and decreased demand in Asia. Due to competitive pressures and difficult market conditions, we granted more pricing discounts and customer allowances than in previous years. This impact was partially offset by increased sales volumes of communications products and optical networks in the second half of 1999 as market conditions improved. 

Net revenue from products increased 55.8 percent in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 3.0 percent in 1999 from 1998. Excluding the sale of certain portions of our U.S. portfolio of lease assets to CIT, net revenue from 35 38 products increased 50.1 percent in 2000 from 1999. Net revenue from services and other increased 18.8 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 14.6 percent in 1999 from 1998. The relatively greater product revenue growth in 2000 was primarily due to the growing communications market and the increased demand in Asia. Generally, there is a lag between service revenue growth and product revenue growth. This lag occurs because service revenue increases as our installed base of products increases and warranty periods expire. Product revenue decreased in 1999 primarily due to weakness in the semiconductor industry and decreased demand in Asia. 

Earnings from operations Earnings from operations from our test and measurement business increased 138.2 percent to $898 million in 2000 from 1999 and increased 8.3 percent to $377 million in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 resulted primarily from higher net revenue as discussed above. In 1999, the increase resulted from lower cost of products and services and other partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. 

Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and 2.0 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. 

The decrease in 2000 was primarily due to higher net revenue partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies incurred in our efforts to meet customer demand. 

The decrease in 1999 was due to cost savings resulting from the 1998 restructuring and was partially offset by the effect of lower volumes of products sold, primarily wireless communication test equipment and automated test equipment, and higher service revenue and the associated higher cost of this revenue. 

Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased 4.2 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and increased 1.2 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. 

The decrease in 2000 was due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in 1999 from 1998 was due to slightly lower net revenue combined with higher levels of expense. In 1999, continued savings from cost reduction programs initiated in the second half of 1998 partially offset this trend. However, costs incurred as part of becoming a stand-alone entity, particularly costs related to branding moved overall operating expenses higher. 

Research and development expenses increased 23.8 percent in 2000 compared to 1999 and were unchanged in 1999 compared to 1998. The increase in 2000 reflects increased activity in new product development in the communications market. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 40.3 percent in 2000 from 1999 and increased 3.4 percent in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own as well as higher selling and marketing costs including branding expenses. In 1999, cost reduction programs initiated in 1998 slowed overall expense growth and significantly decreased some variable operating costs. 

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS Net revenue Net revenue from our semiconductor products business increased 28.5 percent to $2.2 billion in 2000 from 1999 and 9.4 percent to $1.7 billion in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was the result of strong growth in all semiconductor products including wireless, networking and imaging components. Networking component growth was the result of growth in the sales of fiber-optic transceivers and high-speed networking products tailored for Metro Area Network (MAN), as well as storage area networking products and Gigabit Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN) applications. Imaging products for digital cameras and optical mice also achieved particularly strong growth in 2000. The increase in 1999 was achieved despite the sale of the 36 39 power amplifier business in late 1998. If net revenue in 1998 were adjusted to exclude revenue of the power amplifier business, net revenue would have increased by 15.2 percent in 1999 over 1998. Net revenue growth in 1999 primarily reflects increased shipments of fiber optics products, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), motion control products, wireless semiconductor products, and high-speed networking products. As a percentage of net revenue for the semiconductor products business, revenue from sales to Hewlett-Packard, consisting primarily of ASICs and motion control products, was 30.3 percent in 2000, 37.0 percent in 1999 and 34.5 percent in 1998. 

In 2000, we expanded our existing joint venture relationship with Philips to develop our manufacturing light-emitting diodes (LED) and transferred a portion of our LED business into the joint venture. LEDs are used for various lighting and display purposes. Since we do not have a majority ownership interest in the joint venture, the revenue, costs and expenses of the LED business transferred to the joint venture are no longer consolidated in our results. Instead, we record our portion of the joint venture's net earnings or loss in other income (expense), net, which in 2000, was minimal. Adjusting the 1999 base for revenues relating to the LED business and our exit from the microprocessor business, net revenue growth for 2000 would have been 40.3 percent. 

Earnings (loss) from operations Earnings from operations from our semiconductor products business increased 103.0 percent to $270 million in 2000 from 1999 and increased 225.5 percent to $133 million in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 resulted from higher net revenue and lower cost of products as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in 1999 resulted from higher revenue and cost savings from the 1998 restructuring. 

Cost of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased 6.7 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 13.5 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. 

Adjusting for the 1999 impairment charge of $51 million and the transfer of a portion of our LED business to Philips, cost of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased 3.1 percentage points in 2000 from 1999. The decrease in 2000 was primarily related to increased volumes and a more favorable product mix. 

Adjusting for both the 1999 impairment charge and the 1998 restructuring, cost of products as a percentage of net revenue decreased 11.1 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. The decrease in 1999 resulted from increased sales volumes of ASIC's and a more profitable product mix, especially higher volumes of fiber optic communications products, motion control devices and microprocessors. 

Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 2.2 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 1.0 percentage point in 1999 from 1998. 

The increase in 2000 was primarily due to infrastructure costs related to operating on our own and increased research and development costs. The decrease in 1999 was primarily the result of higher net revenue. 

Research and development expenses increased 37.9 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 10.5 percent in 1999 from 1998. The increases in both years reflect increased development in the fiber optics, high-speed networking, and image and position sensor products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 42.5 percent in 2000 and were unchanged in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to operating on our own as well as higher selling and marketing costs, including branding expenses. 

HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS 37 40 In the first quarter of 2001, we announced an agreement to sell our healthcare solutions business to Philips. See Overview section of the MD&A. This sale is contingent upon customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. 

Net revenue Net revenue from our healthcare solutions business decreased 5.9 percent to $1.4 billion in 2000 from 1999 and increased 12.0 percent to $1.5 billion in 1999 from 1998. The decrease in 2000 was primarily due to a slow-down in capital expenditures by U.S. hospitals and increased discounts. In addition, lower volumes and an unfavorable currency impact in Europe contributed to the decline. 

Also, some of our customers accelerated purchases into 1999 to avoid potential Year 2000 issues. The increase in 1999 was primarily related to strong sales in the second half of 1999 from cardiology products and patient monitoring products partially offset by a decline from ultrasound imaging products. In the first half of 1999, internal production constraints resulting from our transition to a new enterprise resource planning system contributed to the decline in revenue from the ultrasound imaging products and also affected the growth rate in patient monitoring revenue. These implementation issues have subsequently been resolved. 

Earnings (loss) from operations The healthcare solutions business had a loss of $96 million in 2000 as compared to earnings of $125 million in 1999 and earnings of $62 million in 1998. Excluding restructuring charges in 2000, our healthcare solutions business had a loss of $75 million. The decline in earnings in 2000 was due to lower net revenue as well as higher costs and expenses. The increase in 1999 was primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher costs and expenses. 

Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased by 5.4 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 1.9 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily attributable to lower net revenue resulting from lower volumes and higher discounts as well as higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own. In addition, costs relating to the restructuring and an unfavorable product mix contributed to this increase. The decrease in 1999 was primarily due to lower overhead, lower product installation costs and a more profitable product mix. 

Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 9.8 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased 1.8 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. 

The increase in 2000 was primarily due to lower net revenue and higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own. In addition, expenses relating to restructuring and increased goodwill charges related to acquisitions in 2000 contributed to the increase. In 1999, the decrease was due to higher net revenue partially offset by higher expenses. 

Research and development expenses increased 10.1 percent in 2000 from 1999 and increased 7.0 percent in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was largely a result of on-going development projects including the new automatic external defibrillator, ultrasound imaging and web-enabled wireless patient monitoring devices. The 1999 increase was largely a result of our efforts to develop new automatic external defibrillator products. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21.1 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 7.3 percent in 1999 from 1998. In 2000, the increase was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own. Costs related to our becoming a separate, stand-alone entity, including advertising expenses, accounted for approximately half of the increase in 1999 from 1998. In addition, expenses relating to the restructuring and increased goodwill amortization charges related to 2000 acquisitions contributed to the increase. Most of the remainder of the increase in 1999 was due to goodwill amortization charges associated with the Heartstream acquisition in 1998. 

38 41 CHEMICAL ANALYSIS Net revenue Net revenue from our chemical analysis business was essentially flat at $1.0 billion in 2000 and 1999 and increased 9.4 percent to $1.0 billion in 1999 from 1998. In 2000, revenue growth in our products sold to the pharmaceutical and life sciences markets was partially offset by weakness in our traditional chemical and environmental markets. New product releases contributed to increased sales of our liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry products. 

Services and other revenue was flat in 2000 from 1999. The net revenue increase in 1999 was generated by growth across all product lines and included a 14.5 percent increase in services and other revenue. Demand within the pharmaceutical industry was especially strong, leading to increased sales of our liquid chromatography products. In addition, sales to our customers in Asia in the second half of 1999 increased as economic conditions in the region continued to improve. 

Earnings from operations Earnings from operations from our chemical analysis business decreased 78.6 percent to $24 million in 2000 from 1999 and increased 49.3 percent to $112 million in 1999 from 1998. The decrease in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to the costs of operating on our own as well as planned research and development in life sciences to launch new products. The increase in 1999 was due primarily to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher costs and expenses. 

Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.9 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and decreased by 3.6 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. In 2000, the increase was primarily due to lower volumes, start-up costs for life sciences products as well as higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own. In 1999, the improvement was related to higher volumes, greater manufacturing efficiencies in our mass spectrometer and liquid chromatography product lines and lower warranty costs. 

In addition, greater efficiency within the service business accounted for 0.8 percentage points of the improvement. 

Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased 6.8 percentage points in 2000 from 1999 and increased 0.6 percentage points in 1999 from 1998. 

In 2000, the increase resulted primarily from increased life sciences research and development activities, higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses relating to operating on our own. The increase in 1999 resulted from greater growth in expenses than in net revenue. 

Research and development expenses increased 27.0 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 13.9 percent in 1999 from 1998. The increases reflected new product development programs in the life sciences. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.5 percent in 2000 from 1999 and 10.6 percent in 1999 from 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to higher infrastructure costs and branding expenses related to operating on our own. In addition, the increase in 1999 was primarily due to higher marketing and field selling costs. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our financial position remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $996 million at October 31, 2000. 

Prior to November 1, 1999, cash receipts associated with our businesses were transferred to Hewlett-Packard on a daily basis and Hewlett-Packard provided funds to cover our disbursements. Accordingly, we reported no cash or cash equivalents at October 31, 1999 and 1998. In accordance with our separation 39 42 agreement with Hewlett-Packard, as of November 1, 1999, Hewlett-Packard retained some of our assets and liabilities and transferred to us some of the assets and liabilities related to its business. In November and December 1999, Hewlett-Packard made cash payments to us totaling $1.3 billion to fund our working capital and other needs of our operations as a separate, stand-alone entity. In addition, Hewlett-Packard transferred approximately $0.5 billion to fund our acquisition of Yokogawa Electric Corporation's (Yokagawa) 25% minority interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. The net proceeds of our initial public offering of $2.1 billion were received in November 1999 and immediately distributed to Hewlett-Packard as a dividend. 

Of the total $1.8 billion received from Hewlett-Packard, $1.1 billion was classified as net cash provided by financing activities and $0.7 billion was classified among several categories as net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended October 31, 2000. 

We generated cash from operations of $838 million in 2000 compared to $461 million in 1999 and $751 million in 1998. In 2000, cash from operations was primarily a result of net earnings and from the sale of certain portions of our U.S. portfolio of lease assets to CIT. In 1999 and 1998, cash from operations was primarily a result of net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization. In addition, lower cash from operations in 1999 resulted from a significant increase in accounts receivable due to particularly strong shipments in October 1999. 

Net cash used by investing activities was $1,117 million in 2000 compared to $309 million in 1999 and $272 million in 1998. In all periods, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from divestitures and the disposal of excess, unused or retired assets constituted substantially all of our cash used in investing activities. We used $691 million in 2000 to pay for the first and second installments of the purchase of Yokagawa's minority interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd and several other companies. We expect to purchase the remaining 4.2% of Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd's shares owned by Yokogawa prior to January 31, 2001. Hewlett-Packard provided the funding for the Yokogawa transaction in November 1999. 

Future sales of our portfolio of lease assets to CIT are anticipated during 2001. We are currently negotiating the details of the future sales agreements. 

The financial impacts are not determinable at this time. 

In the first quarter of 2001, we entered into an agreement to sell our healthcare solutions business to Philips for approximately $1.7 billion. 

On January 5, 2001, we acquired OSI for approximately $684 million in cash. 

Cash for this transaction was provided by cash on hand as well as proceeds of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowing under our existing credit facilities. 

Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economies and markets. We believe that cash generated from operations and our unused lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and research and development funding requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we may require or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future. We cannot assure that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms. 

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS IF WE DO NOT INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL BECOME OBSOLETE, AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL SUFFER. 

We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete 40 43 over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: - properly identify customer needs; - price our products competitively; - innovate and develop new technologies and applications; - successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; - manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; and - differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings. 

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their new products. We therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers' products. 

Development of new products generally requires a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of these innovations. Our other businesses will encounter similar challenges. We would suffer competitive harm if we dedicate a significant amount of resources to the development of products and technologies that do not achieve broad market acceptance. 

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DOES NOT MATCH OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, OUR EARNINGS MAY SUFFER. 

Demand for our products has put increased pressure on our manufacturing capacity, especially in the wireless and fiber optic areas. If we are not able to increase our manufacturing capacity in the time necessary to meet demand, if we experience difficulties in obtaining parts or components needed for manufacturing, or if demand exceeds our expectations, we may experience insufficient manufacturing capacity. If our manufacturing capacity does not keep pace with product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business. Conversely, if demand for our products decreases, the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our earnings. 

FAILURE OF SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF PARTS IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS Certain parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. Suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Our results may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely manner. 

ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN KOREA AND JAPAN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES. 

Since we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: - changes in foreign currency exchange rates; - changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets; - trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; - potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; 41 44 - difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; - differing labor regulations; - differing protection of intellectual property; and - unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. 

We do a portion of our businesses in Korea and Japan, which have been subject to increased economic instability in recent years. Our businesses declined in 1998 when Korea and Japan experienced economic difficulties. The recurrence of weakness in these economies or weakness in other international economies could have a significant negative effect on our future operating results. 

FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. 

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability, and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, relatively small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. For example, when our revenue declined in the second half of 1998 as a result of the financial crisis in Asia, it caused significant negative fluctuations in our operating results. 

Other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include: - demand for and market acceptance of our products; - competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices; - adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and other major regions in which we do business; - adverse changes in industries, such as semiconductors and electronics, on which we are particularly dependent; - changes in the relative portion of our revenue represented by our various products and customers; - unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction of new products; - our competitors' announcements of new products, services or technological innovations; - increased costs of raw materials or supplies; - changes in the timing of product orders; and - our inability to forecast revenue in a given quarter from large system sales. 

THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY LABOR MARKET IS VERY COMPETITIVE, AND OUR BUSINESSES WILL SUFFER IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL. 

Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain and expand our businesses. 

Competition for qualified personnel in the technology area is intense, and we operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive, including the Silicon Valley region of Northern California where our headquarters and central research and development laboratories are located. 

Although we believe we offer competitive salaries and benefits, certain of our businesses have had to increase spending in order to retain personnel. 

OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED IF THE INDUSTRIES INTO WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS ARE IN DOWNWARD CYCLES. 

Several significant industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical and are subject to general economic conditions. For example, in 1998 the operating results of our test and measurement and 42 45 semiconductor products businesses were harmed by downturns in the semiconductor market. From time to time, the electronics industry has also experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions. In addition, we are starting to see a softening in portions of the telecommunications industry and the computer industry. The computer industry is also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products. These industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and the subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Any significant downturn in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our businesses. 

OUR ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN EXPECTED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE COMPANIES WE ACQUIRE AND OUR EFFORTS MAY DIVERT ATTENTION FROM OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS. 

In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. Although completion of any one transaction may not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows taken as a whole, our financial results may differ from the investment community's expectations in a given quarter. Divestiture of a part of our business may result in the cancellation of orders and charges to earnings. 

Acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate with a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may also have to develop, manufacture and market products with our products in a way that enhances the performance of the combined business or product line. 

Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity into Agilent depends on a variety of factors, including: - the hiring and retention of key employees, - management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas, and - the integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities. 

All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. 

OUR SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AND SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS WITH HEWLETT-PACKARD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO SELL TO OTHER COMPANIES AND COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES. 

We do not have a license under Hewlett-Packard's patents, patent applications and invention disclosures for, with some exceptions, inkjet products, printer products (including printer supplies, accessories and components), document scanners and computing products. In addition, our ICBD Technology Ownership and License Agreement, which generally covers integrated circuit technology that is used in integrated circuits for Hewlett-Packard's printers, scanners and computers, provides that for a period of three years in some cases and 10 years in other cases we are prohibited, with some exceptions, from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of integrated circuits for use in inkjet products, printer products (including printer supplies, accessories and components), document scanners and computing products to third parties other than Hewlett-Packard. 

Although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to Hewlett-Packard of these kinds of integrated circuits, the supply agreement does not require Hewlett-Packard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us. In the event that Hewlett-Packard reduces its purchase of our integrated circuits, we would be unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers. 

43 46 IF DEMAND FOR HEWLETT-PACKARD'S PRINTER, WORKSTATION AND SERVER PRODUCTS DECLINES, OR IF HEWLETT-PACKARD CHOOSES A DIFFERENT SUPPLIER, OUR SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS BUSINESS REVENUE WILL DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY. 

Historically, our semiconductor products business has sold products to Hewlett-Packard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of Hewlett-Packard. For 2000, Hewlett-Packard accounted for 6.5% of our total net revenue and 30.3% of our semiconductor products business' net revenue, respectively. In comparison, for 1999, Hewlett-Packard accounted for 10.0% of our total net revenue and 37.0% of our semiconductor products business' net revenue, respectively. For 1998, Hewlett-Packard accounted for 8.8% of our total net revenue and 34.5% of our semiconductor products business' net revenue, respectively. 

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR HEWLETT-PACKARD'S BUSINESS MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF OUR SEPARATION DUE TO DECREASED ACCESS TO HEWLETT-PACKARD'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY, TECHNOLOGY PLANS, FUTURE PRODUCT FEATURES AND PRODUCT SUPPLY NEEDS. 

In the past, we have benefited from our access to Hewlett-Packard's research and development strategy, technology plans, future product features and product supply needs in competing for Hewlett-Packard's business. If our competitors were to gain better access to Hewlett-Packard as a result of our separation, our competitors may be able to develop products that better meet the future needs of Hewlett-Packard, decreasing the competitiveness of our products. 

In addition, we have taken advantage of collaborative relationships with some of Hewlett-Packard's businesses and we may not continue to enjoy all of the benefits of these collaborative relationships. 

WE MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE MANUFACTURE, PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF CHEMICALS, AND, IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES OR BE PROHIBITED FROM DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS. 

Some of our chemical analysis business' products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing and distribution are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing and distribution of these chemicals to these laws, and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance. 

IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN REGULATIONS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO RECALL PRODUCTS AND CEASE THEIR MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION, AND WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES. 

The medical device products produced by our healthcare solutions business are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international agencies. Their regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. In the first quarter of 2001, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our healthcare solutions business to Philips. The sale is contingent upon customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. 

In addition, our chemical analysis products are used in the drug design and production processes to test compliance with the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and similar regulations. Therefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. 

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST OPERATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO UNREIMBURSED COSTS AND COULD HARM ON-SITE OPERATIONS AND THE FUTURE USE AND VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES INVOLVED. 

Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard for known subsurface contamination. Hewlett-Packard has agreed to retain the liability for all known subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and 44 47 time-consuming negotiations and litigation. In addition, Hewlett-Packard will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While Hewlett-Packard has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot assure you that Hewlett-Packard will fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. 

We are indemnifying Hewlett-Packard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from Hewlett-Packard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with existing subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination. 

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY ONGOING OPERATIONS COULD SUBJECT US TO SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE. 

Our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. We may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, AND OUR FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESSES. 

We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the terms of government contracts. We have received and are complying with formal requests for information by the government regarding our sales of products to some of the government agencies with which we have contracted. These requests may result in legal proceedings against us or liability which may be significant. 

WE AND OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, AND WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THESE REGULATIONS. 

Several of our product lines are subject to other significant international, federal, state and local, health and safety, packaging, product content and labor regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or remedy past violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of portions or all of our operations, impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. 

Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation of other agencies such as the United States Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses will be harmed. 

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE ARE INFRINGING THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND WE COULD SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR LICENSING EXPENSES OR BE PREVENTED FROM SELLING PRODUCTS. 

Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights. 

While we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid 45 48 intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, products and services. Moreover, in connection with future intellectual property infringement claims, we will only have the benefit of asserting counterclaims based on Hewlett-Packard's intellectual property portfolio in limited circumstances, and we will only be able to offer licenses to Hewlett-Packard's intellectual property in order to resolve claims in limited circumstances. In addition, although we believe we have all necessary rights to use the new brand name, our rights to use it may be challenged by others. 

Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. 

We often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses. We cannot assure you that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our position with respect to the negotiation of licenses may change as a result of our separation from Hewlett-Packard. Our patent cross-license agreement with Hewlett-Packard gives us a conditional right to sublicense only a portion of Hewlett-Packard's intellectual property portfolio. As a result, in negotiating patent cross-license agreements with third parties, we may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could sublicense Hewlett-Packard's entire intellectual property portfolio. 

THIRD PARTIES MAY INFRINGE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND WE MAY EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ENFORCING OUR RIGHTS OR SUFFER COMPETITIVE INJURY. 

Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. 

Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. 

We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. 

Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. 

IF OUR FACTORIES OR FACILITIES WERE TO EXPERIENCE CATASTROPHIC LOSS DUE TO EARTHQUAKE, OUR OPERATIONS WOULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. 

Several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their location. We have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity, such as our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Laboratories in California and our production facilities in Washington and Japan. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. 

Agilent self-insures against such losses and does not carry catastrophic insurance policies to cover potential losses resulting from earthquakes. 

46 49 WE CURRENTLY STILL USE SOME OF HEWLETT-PACKARD'S INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING OUR OWN INFORMATION SYSTEMS. 

We currently use Hewlett-Packard's systems to support a portion of our operations, mainly customer support and networks. We have an agreement with Hewlett-Packard for Hewlett-Packard to continue to provide these information services to us through the end of 2001. During this time period, while we are developing our own systems, we will be dependent on Hewlett-Packard for the provision of these information technology services that are critical to running our businesses. Many of the systems we currently use are proprietary to Hewlett-Packard and are very complex. 

We are in the process of creating our own information systems to eventually replace Hewlett-Packard's systems. We may not be successful in implementing these systems and transitioning data from Hewlett-Packard's systems to ours. We are implementing new enterprise resource planning software applications to manage some of our information systems. 

THE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO US BY HEWLETT-PACKARD MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR NEEDS, AND WE MAY PAY INCREASED COSTS TO REPLACE THESE SERVICES AFTER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH HEWLETT-PACKARD EXPIRE. 

Hewlett-Packard has agreed to provide certain transitional services to us, including services related to: - information technology systems; - buildings and facilities; and - administrative services. 

These services may not be provided at the same level as when we were part of Hewlett-Packard, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits. We also lease and sublease certain office and manufacturing facilities from Hewlett-Packard. These transitional service and leasing arrangements generally have a term of less than two years following the separation. After the expiration of these various arrangements, we may not be able to replace the transitional services or enter into appropriate leases in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including cost, as favorable as those we receive from Hewlett-Packard. 

These agreements were made in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship and were negotiated in the overall context of our separation from Hewlett-Packard. As a result, some of these agreements may have terms and conditions that are less specific than some agreements that are negotiated at arms-length. The prices charged to us under these agreements may be different from the prices that we may be required to pay third parties for similar services or the costs of similar services if we undertake them ourselves. 

OUR HISTORICAL 1999 AND 1998 FINANCIAL INFORMATION MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR RESULTS AS A SEPARATE COMPANY. 

The historical 1999 and 1998 financial information we have included has been carved out from Hewlett-Packard's consolidated financial statements and does not reflect what our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been, had we been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Hewlett-Packard did not account for us as, and we were not operated as, a single stand-alone entity for the 1999 and 1998 periods presented. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future. We did not make adjustments to reflect the many significant changes that will occur in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Hewlett-Packard, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale, increased marketing expenses related to establishing a new brand identity and increased costs associated with being a public, stand-alone company. 

47 50 WE MAY HAVE POTENTIAL BUSINESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH HEWLETT-PACKARD WITH RESPECT TO OUR PAST AND ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. 

Conflicts of interest may arise between Hewlett-Packard and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including: - labor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Hewlett-Packard; - intellectual property matters; - employee retention and recruiting; - major business combinations involving us; and - the nature, quality and pricing of transitional services Hewlett-Packard has agreed to provide us. 

Nothing restricts Hewlett-Packard from competing with us other than some restrictions on the use of patents licensed to Hewlett-Packard by us.
