Documents Incorporated by Reference 2002 Annual Report to   Stockholders - Part I and Part II Proxy Statement -   Annual Meeting of Stockholders May 1, 2003 - Part I and Part III PART I - ITEMS 1, 2, 3, and 4 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Bemis Company, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the Registrant), continues a business formed in 1858. The Registrant was incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company with the name changed to Bemis Company, Inc. in 1965. The Registrant is a principal manufacturer of flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials selling to customers throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe with a growing presence in Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico. In 2002, approximately 79 percent of the Registrants sales were derived from Flexible Packaging segment and approximately 21 percent were derived from Pressure Sensitive Materials segment.
The primary market for its products is the food industry. Other markets include companies in the following types of businesses: chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care products, tissue, batteries, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. Further information about the Registrants operations in different business segments appearing on pages 40 and 41 of the accompanying 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders is expressly incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K Annual Report.
As of December 31, 2002, the Registrant had approximately 11,800 employees, of which an estimated 8,200 were classified as production employees. Many of the North American production employees are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving five different international unions and one independent union and 22 individual contracts with terms ranging from one to six years. During 2002, six contracts covering approximately 1,300 employees at six different locations in the United States and Canada were successfully negotiated. During 2003, six domestic labor agreements are scheduled to expire. Many of the non-North American production employees as well as some of the non-North American salaried workforce are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving six different unions with terms ranging from one to two years.
Working capital elements fluctuate throughout the year in relation to the level of customer volume and other marketplace conditions. Customer and vendor payment terms are split approximately equally between net 30 days and discountable terms. Discounts are generally one percent for payment within ten days. Inventory levels reflect a reasonable balance between raw material pricing and availability, and the Registrants commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which the Registrant operates as most orders placed with the Registrant are for delivery within 90 days or less. The business of each of the segments is not seasonal to any significant extent.
The Registrant is the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of its products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. The Registrant also has a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign countries. The Registrants patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrants results as a whole or those of either of its segments.
2 The Registrants business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure. Subdivisions within each principal business segment are identified to facilitate operating controls and responsibilities. Products produced within the Flexible Packaging segment are high barrier products, polyethylene products, and paper products. Products produced within the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment are printing products, decorative and sheet products, and technical products. A summary of the Registrants business activities reported by its two business segments follows.
Flexible Packaging Segment The Registrant manufactures a broad range of consumer and industrial packaging consisting of high barrier products, polyethylene products, and paper products.
High barrier products include multilayer flexible polymer film structures and barrier laminates for food, medical, and personal care products as well as non-food applications utilizing controlled and modified atmosphere packaging. Additional value is added through flexographic and rotogravure printing as well as pouch making. Primary markets are processed and fresh meat, liquids, frozen foods, cereals, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, pet food, personal care, and medical device packaging. Additional products include blown and cast stretchfilm products, carton sealing tapes and application equipment, and custom thermoformed plastic packaging. Also included are electronically produced film color separations and engravings used in rotogravure and flexographic printing by the packaging industry. High barrier products accounted for 53 percent, 49 percent, and 42 percent of consolidated net sales for the years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. In 2001, management modified its internal reporting of product lines within the Flexible Packaging segment. The change was made to reflect the evolution of certain products, which had evolved from polyethylene structures to products more closely aligned with the multilayered, laminated structures found in our high barrier product lines. This change in reporting accounted for the majority (five percentage points) of the increased percentage of consolidated net sales attributable to high barrier products in 2001. This change had an equal but opposite impact on the percentage change in consolidated net sales attributable to polyethylene products in 2001.
Polyethylene products consist of monolayer and coextruded films which have been flexographically printed and converted to bags or roll stock for such items as bakery products, seed, retail, lawn and garden, tissue, fresh and frozen produce, candy, sanitary products, and disposable diapers; printed shrink overwrap for the food and beverage industry; extruded products, including wide width sheeting, bags on a roll, balers, and shrink pallet covers. Polyethylene products accounted for 18 percent, 21 percent, and 26 percent of consolidated net sales for the years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
Paper products are made up of multiwall and single-ply paper bags, balers, printed paper roll stock, and bag closing materials for food, agricultural, and chemical products. Flexographic and rotogravure printing are enhanced with in-line overlaminating capabilities. Innovations in bag constructions include inner-ply laminations, easy-open/reclosable features, unique valves for fast filling, and high porosity papers. Primary markets include pet products, seed, chemicals, dairy products, fertilizers, feed, minerals, flour, rice, and sugar. Sales of paper products accounted for 8 percent, 9 percent, and 9 percent of consolidated net sales for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
3 Pressure Sensitive Materials Segment The Registrant manufactures pressure sensitive materials such as printing products, decorative and sheet products, and technical products. The Pressure Sensitive Materials segment accounted for 21 percent, 21 percent, and 23 percent of consolidated net sales for the years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
Printing products include narrow-web rolls of pressure sensitive paper, film, and metalized film printing stocks used in high-speed printing and die-cutting of primary package labeling, secondary or promotional decoration, and for high-speed, high-volume data processing (EDP) stocks, bar code labels, and numerous laser printing applications. Primary markets include food packaging, personal care product packaging, inventory control labeling, postage stamps, and laser/ink jet printed labels.
Decorative and sheet products include pressure sensitive papers and films used for decorative signage through computer-aided plotters, digital and screen printers, and photographic overlaminate and mounting materials including optically clear films with built-in UV inhibitors. Offset printers, sign makers, and photo labs use these products on short-run and/or digital printing technology to create labels, signs, or vehicle graphics. Primary markets are sheet printers, shipping labels, indoor and outdoor signage, photograph and digital print overlaminates, and vehicle graphics.
Technical products are pressure sensitive materials that are technically engineered for performance in varied industrial applications. They include micro-thin film adhesives used in delicate electronic parts assembly and pressure sensitives utilizing foam and tape based stocks to perform fastening and mounting functions. Tapes sold to medical markets feature medical-grade adhesives suitable for direct skin contact. Primary markets are batteries, electronics, automotive, construction, medical, and pharmaceuticals.
Announced Divestiture In August 2002, we announced an agreement to sell our pressure sensitive materials business segment for $420 million in cash to UPM-Kymmene, a large, multinational paper company headquartered in Finland. The sale of this business segment will allow us to focus our resources on our larger flexible packaging business. On October 16, 2002, the European regulatory agency gave antitrust clearance for the sale of our pressure sensitive materials business to UPM-Kymmene. In December 2002, Bemis and UPM-Kymmene announced that a request for additional information had been received from the U. S. Department of Justice in connection with the pending sale of our pressure sensitive materials business. This request extends the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to allow for the review of the additional documents supplied. While both companies plan to complete the proposed transaction in the first half of calendar year 2003, the required regulatory approvals from the U.S. Department of Justice cannot be considered perfunctory or certain. Upon receiving U.S. regulatory approval, we will begin discontinued operations presentation for the pressure sensitive materials business segment in our consolidated financial statements as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition While the Registrants sales are made through a variety of distribution methods, more than 90 percent of each segments sales are made by the Registrants direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico to provide prompt and economical service to more than 30,000 customers. The Registrants technically trained 4 sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, and a customer service organization.
No single customer accounts for ten percent or more of the Registrants total sales. Furthermore, the loss of one or a few major customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrants operating results. Nevertheless, business agreements with large customers require a large portion of the manufacturing capacity at a few individual manufacturing sites. Any change in the business arrangement would typically occur over a period of time, which would allow for an orderly transition for both the Registrants manufacturing site and customer.
The major markets in which the Registrant sells its products are highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms. Major competitors in the Flexible Packaging segment include Amcor Ltd, Exopack Company, Hood Corporation, Intertape Polymer Group Inc., Lawson Mardon Group Limited, Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Pliant Corporation, Printpack, Inc., Rexam plc., Sealed Air Corporation, Sonoco Products Company, Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, and Wihuri OY. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment major competitors include Avery Dennison Corporation, Acucote, Inc., Green Bay Packaging Inc., Kanzaki Specialty Papers, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, Ricoh Company, Ltd., Ritrama S. p. A., Flexcon Co., Inc., Spinnaker Industries, Inc., Technicote Inc., UPM-Kymmene, and Wausau Coated Products Inc.
The Registrant considers itself to be a significant factor in the market niches it serves; however, due to the diversity of the Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials segments, the Registrants precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. Advertising is limited primarily to business and trade publications emphasizing the Registrants product features and related technical capabilities and the individual problem-solving approach to customer problems.
Raw Materials Plastic resins and films, paper, inks, and chemicals constitute the basic major raw materials. These are purchased from a variety of industry sources and the Registrant is not dependent on any one supplier for its raw materials. While temporary shortages of raw materials may occur occasionally, these items are currently readily available.
Research and Development Expense Research and development expenditures were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Flexible   Packaging $ 14,509,000 $ 8,527,000 $ 7,298,000 Pressure   Sensitive Materials 2,937,000 1,786,000 2,782,000 Total $ 17,446,000 $ 10,313,000 $ 10,080,000 The 2002 increase reflects an increased focus throughout the Registrant to more completely capture this element of cost. The 2001 reduction within the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment results from this segments ongoing focuses on internal efficiencies to assist in its efforts to deal with less favorable economic conditions in North America and increased price competition in certain markets.
5 Environmental Control Compliance with federal, state, and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating discharges of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of the Registrant and its subsidiaries.
