As of March 5, 2001, the Registrant had 52,805,495 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.
Documents Incorporated by Reference 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders - Part I and Part II Proxy Statement - Annual Meeting of Stockholders May 3, 2001 - Part I and Part III ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Bemis Company, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the Registrant), continues a business formed in 1858. The Registrant was incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company with the name changed to Bemis Company, Inc. in 1965. The Registrant is a principal manufacturer of flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials selling to customers throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe with a growing presence in Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico. In 2000, approximately 77 percent of the Registrants sales were derived from Flexible Packaging and approximately 23 percent were derived from Pressure Sensitive Materials.
The primary market for its products is the food industry. Other markets include companies in chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care products, batteries, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. Further information about the Registrant's operations in different business segments appearing on page 40 of the accompanying 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders is expressly incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K Annual Report.
As of December 31, 2000, the Registrant had approximately 11,000 employees, of which an estimated 7,800 were classified as production employees. Many of the production employees are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving five different international unions and 18 individual contracts with terms ranging from three to six years. During 2000, four contracts covering approximately 800 employees at four different locations in the United States were successfully negotiated. During 2001, one Canadian and two domestic labor agreements are scheduled to expire.
Working capital elements throughout the year fluctuate in relation to the level of business. Customer and vendor payment terms are split approximately equal between net 30 days and discountable terms. Discounts are generally one percent for payment within ten days. Inventory levels reflect a reasonable balance between raw material pricing and availability, and the Registrants commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which the Registrant operates; most orders placed with the Registrant are for delivery within 90 days or less.
The Registrant owns patents, licenses, trademarks, and trade names on its products. The loss of any or all patents, licenses, trademarks, or trade names would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's results as a whole or either of its segments. The business of each of the segments is not seasonal to any significant extent.
The Registrants business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure. Subdivisions within each principal business segment are identified to facilitate operating controls and responsibilities. Aggregated subdivisions within the Flexible Packaging segment are high barrier products, polyethylene products, and paper products. Aggregated subdivisions within the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment are roll label products, graphics and distribution products, and technical and industrial products. A summary of the Registrant's business activities reported by its two business segments follows: Flexible Packaging The Registrant and its subsidiaries manufacture a broad range of consumer and industrial packaging consisting of high barrier products, polyethylene products, and paper products.
High barrier products include flexible polymer film structures and barrier laminates for food, medical, and personal care products as well as non-food applications utilizing controlled and modified atmosphere packaging. Value is added through flexographic and rotogravure printing as well as pouch making. Primary markets are processed and fresh meat, liquids, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, pet food, personal care, and medical packaging. Additional products include blown and cast stretchfilm products, carton sealing tapes and application equipment, and custom thermoformed plastic packaging. Also included are electronically produced film color separations and engravings used in rotogravure and flexographic printing by the packaging industry. High barrier products accounted for 42 percent, 40 percent, and 39 percent of consolidated net sales for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Polyethylene products consist of monolayer and coextruded films which have been flexographically printed and converted to bags or roll stock for such items as bakery products, seed, retail, lawn and garden, ice, fresh and frozen produce, candy, sanitary products, and disposable diapers; printed shrink overwrap for the food and beverage industry; extruded products including wide width sheeting, bags on a roll, balers, and shrink pallet covers. Polyethylene products accounted for 26 percent, 25 percent, and 25 percent of consolidated net sales for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Paper products are made up of multiwall and small paper bags, balers, printed paper roll stock, and bag closing materials for dry pet food and agricultural/chemical products. Flexographic and rotogravure printing are enhanced with in-line overlaminating capabilities. Innovations in bag constructions include inner-ply laminations of odor, grease, and moisture barriers in addition to easy-open, reclosable, and convenient handle features. Primary markets include pet products, seed, chemicals, dairy products, fertilizers, feed, minerals, flour, rice, and sugar. Sales of paper products accounted for 9 percent, 10 percent, and 10 percent of consolidated net sales for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Pressure Sensitive Materials The Registrant through its subsidiaries manufactures pressure sensitive materials such as roll label products, graphics and distribution products, and technical and industrial products. Pressure Sensitive Materials accounted for 23 percent, 25 percent, and 26 percent of consolidated net sales for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Roll label products include narrow-web rolls of pressure sensitive film, paper, and metalized film printing stocks used in high-speed printing and die-cutting of primary package labeling, secondary or promotional decoration, and for high-speed, high-volume data processing (EDP) stocks, bar code labels, and numerous laser printing applications. Primary markets include food packaging, personal care product packaging, inventory control labeling, and laser/ink jet printed labels.
Graphics and distribution products include pressure sensitive films used for decorative signage through computer-aided plotters, digital and screen printers, and photographic overlaminate and mounting materials including optically cle ar films with built-in UV inhibitors. Offset printers, sign makers, and photo labs use these products on short-run and/or digital printing technology to create labels, signs, or vehicle graphics. Primary markets are sheet printers, shipping labels, indoor and outdoor signage, photograph and digital print overlaminates, and vehicle graphics.
Technical and industrial products are pressure sensitive materials that are technically engineered for performance in varied industrial applications. They include micro-thin film adhesives used in delicate electronic parts assembly and pressure sensitives utilizing foam and tape based stocks to perform fastening and mounting functions. Tapes sold to medical markets feature medical-grade adhesives suitable for direct skin contact. Primary markets are batteries, electronics, automotive, construction, medical, and pharmaceuticals.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition While the Registrant's sales are made through a variety of distribution methods, more than 90 percent of each segment's sales are made by the Registrant's direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico to provide prompt and economical service to more than 30,000 customers. The Registrants technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, and a customer service organization.
No single customer accounts for ten percent or more of the Registrant's total sales. Furthermore, the loss of one or a few major customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's operating results. Nevertheless, business agreements with large customers require a large portion of the manufacturing capacity at a few individual manufacturing sites. Any change in the business arrangement would typically occur over a period of time, which would allow for an orderly transition for both the Registrants manufacturing site and customer.
The major markets in which the Registrant sells its products are highly competitive. Areas of competition include price, innovation, quality, and service. This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms. Major competitors in the Flexible Packaging segment include Pechiney, Printpack, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Lawson Mardon Group Limited, Rexam plc., Sonoco Products Company, Amcor Ltd, Pliant Corporation, Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, International Paper Company, and Southern Bag Corporation. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment major competitors include Avery Dennison Corporation, Flexcon Co., Inc., Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, Spinnaker Industries, Inc., Jackstadt GmbH (Germany), and UPM-Kymmene Corporation.
The Registrant considers itself to be a significant factor in the market niches it serves; however, due to the diversity of the Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials segments, the Registrant's precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. Advertising is limited primarily to business and trade publications emphasizing the Registrants product features and related technical capabilities and the individual problem-solving approach to customer problems.
Raw Materials Plastic resins and films, paper, inks, and chemicals constitute the basic major raw materials. These are purchased from a variety of industry sources and the Registrant is not dependent on any one supplier for its raw materials. While temporary shortages of raw materials may occur occasionally, these items are currently readily available.
Research and Development Expense Research and development expenditures were as follows: 2000 1999 1998 Flexible Packaging $7,298,000 $7,604,000 $6,504,000 Pressure Sensitive   Materials 2,782,000 4,080,000 5,720,000 Total $10,080,000 $11,684,000 $12,224,000 The decrease occurred principally within the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment as this segment focuses on internal efficiencies to assist in its efforts to deal with less favorable economic conditions in North America and increased price competition in certain markets.
Environmental Control Compliance with federal, state, and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating discharges of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of the Registrant and its subsidiaries.

Corporate The executive offices of the Registrant, which are leased, are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Registrant considers its plants and other physical properties to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of its business. The manufacturing plants operate at varying levels of capacity depending on the type of operation and market conditions.
ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Registrant is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including environmental related litigation, the most active of which is discussed in the following paragraph. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, based on consultation with Registrants General Counsel, that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect upon the Registrant's financial condition or results of operations.
During 2000 the Registrant settled a lawsuit brought by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in Federal District Court for the District of Connecticut in relation to the disposal of liquid industrial wastes at the Yaworski Lagoon site in Canterbury, Connecticut.
