Ullem, Chief Financial   Officer of the Company, pursuant to Section1350, dated March1,   2011 2 Table of Contents PARTI  ITEMS 1, 1A, 1B, 2, and 3 ITEM 1  BUSINESS Bemis Company,Inc., a Missouri corporation (the Registrant or Company), continues a business formed in 1858. The Company was incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company with the name changed to Bemis Company,Inc. in 1965. The Company is a principal manufacturer of flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials, selling to customers throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. In 2010, approximately 88 percent of the Companys sales were derived from the Flexible Packaging segment and approximately 12 percent were derived from the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment.
The Companys products are sold to customers primarily in the food industry. Other customers include companies in the following types of businesses: chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. Further information about the Companys operations in its business segments is available at Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
On March1, 2010, Bemis completed its acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of Rio Tinto plc. Under the terms of the $1.2 billion transaction, Bemis acquired 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand, which recorded 2009 net sales totaling $1.4 billion. These facilities are included in our flexible packaging business segment and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment Bemis product offerings and technological capabilities.
As of December31, 2010, the Company had nearly 20,000 employees, about 13,300 of whom were classified as production employees. Many of the North American production employees are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving six different international unions, one independent union, and 27 individual contracts with terms ranging from one to five years. During 2010, six contracts covering 1,520 employees at six different locations in the United States were successfully negotiated while one contract covering 554 employees at one domestic location continues to be negotiated. Five domestic labor agreements covering 498 employees are scheduled to expire in 2011. Many of the non-North American production employees as well as some of the non-North American salaried workforce are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving 23 different unions with terms ranging from one to two years.
The acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging on March1, 2010 added approximately 4,400 employees, of which approximately 3,200 were classified as production employees.
Working capital elements fluctuate throughout the year in relation to the level of customer volume and other marketplace conditions. Inventory levels reflect a reasonable balance between raw material pricing and availability, and the Companys commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which the Company operates. The business of each of the segments is not seasonal to any significant extent.
The Company is the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of its products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. The Company also has a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign countries. The Companys patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results as a whole or those of either of its segments.
The Companys business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure. A summary of the Companys business activities reported by its two business segments follows.
Flexible Packaging Segment The flexible packaging segment manufactures a broad range of packaging for food, consumer goods, and industrial applications. Multilayer flexible polymer film structures and laminates are sold for food, medical, and personal care products as well as non-food applications utilizing vacuum or modified atmosphere packaging. Additional products include blown and cast stretch film products, carton sealing tapes and application equipment, custom thermoformed and injection molded plastic packaging, multiwall paper bags, printed paper roll stock, and bag closing materials. Markets for our products include processed and fresh meat, liquids, frozen foods, cereals, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, pet food, bakery, seed, lawn and garden, tissue, fresh produce, personal care and hygiene, disposable diapers, printed shrink overwrap for the food and beverage industry, agribusiness, pharmaceutical, minerals, and medical device packaging.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Segment The pressure sensitive materials segment manufactures pressure sensitive adhesive coated paper and film substrates sold into label, graphic, and technical markets. Products for label markets include narrow-web rolls of pressure sensitive paper, film, and metalized film printing stocks used in high-speed printing and die-cutting. Products for graphic markets include pressure sensitive films used for decorative signage through computer-aided plotters, digital and screen printers, and photographic overlaminate and mounting materials including optically clear films with built-in UV inhibitors. Products for technical markets include micro-thin film adhesives used in delicate electronic parts assembly and pressure sensitive applications utilizing foam and tape based stocks to perform fastening and mounting functions.
3 Table of Contents Marketing, Distribution, and Competition While the Companys sales are made through a variety of distribution methods, more than 90 percent of each segments sales are made by the Companys direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific to provide prompt and economical service to more than 30,000 customers. The Companys technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, and a customer service organization.
No single customer accounts for ten percent or more of the Companys total sales. Furthermore, the loss of one or a few major customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results. Nevertheless, business arrangements with large customers require a large portion of the manufacturing capacity at a few individual manufacturing sites. Any change in the business arrangement would typically occur over a period of time, which would allow for an orderly transition for both the Companys manufacturing site and the customer.
The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms. Major competitors in the Flexible Packaging segment include Amcor Limited, Berry Plastics Corporation, Bryce Corporation, Exopack Company, Hood Packaging Corporation, Printpack,Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Sonoco Products Company, Wihuri OY, and Winpak ltd. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment major competitors include 3M, Acucote,Inc., Avery Dennison Corporation, FLEXcon Corporation, Green Bay Packaging Inc., Ricoh Company,Ltd., Ritrama Inc., Spinnaker Industries,Inc., Technicote Inc., UPM-Kymmene Corporation, and Wausau Coated Products Inc.
The Company considers itself to be a significant factor in the market niches it serves; however, due to the diversity of the Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials segments, the Companys precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. Advertising is limited primarily to business and trade publications emphasizing the Companys product features and related technical capabilities.
Raw Materials Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the basic major raw materials. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources and the Company is not dependent on any one supplier for its raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, the Company expects to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currently, raw materials are readily available.
Research and Development Expense Research and development expenditures were as follows: (in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Flexible Packaging $ 28,271 $ 17,301 $ 17,646 Pressure Sensitive Materials 6,067 7,041 7,364 Total $ 34,338 $ 24,342 $ 25,010 Environmental Control Compliance with federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating discharges of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company and its subsidiaries.

4 Table of Contents Explanation of Terms Describing the Companys Products Barrier laminate A multilayer plastic film made by laminating two or more films together with the use of adhesive or a molten plastic to achieve a barrier for the planned package contents.
Barrier products Products that provide protection and extend the shelf life of the contents of the package. These products provide this protection by combining different types of plastics and additives into a multilayered plastic package. These products protect the contents from such things as oxygen, moisture, light, odor, or other environmental factors.
Blown film A plastic film that is extruded through an annular die in the form of a tube and then expanded by an internal column of air in the manufacturing process.
Bundling films A film manufactured by a modified blown film process that is used for wrapping and holding multipacks of products such as canned goods and bottles of liquids, replacing corrugate and fiberboard.
Cast film A plastic film that is extruded through a straight slot die as a flat sheet during its manufacturing process.
Coextruded film A blown or cast film extruded with multiple layers extruded simultaneously.
Controlled atmosphere packaging A package which limits the flow of elements, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide or moisture, into or out of the package.
Crystallized Polyester (PET) CPET. The process of using a combination of formulated resin blends and thermoforming conditions to increase the crystalinity of PET trays, which increases the heat distortion temperature of the trays to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. This allows foods packaged in these trays to go directly from freezer to oven for heating of the food.
EZ Open Packaging Any one of a series of technologies employed to allow the consumer easy access to a packaged product.
Peelable closures, laser or other physical scoring/abrasion of a packaging film may be used. EZ Open can be combined with reclose features such as plastic zippers or the inclusion of pressure sensitive materials into the packaging film.

5 Table of Contents ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Form10-K, or in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could adversely affect the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results.
Acquisitions  We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire.
We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and are actively seeking new acquisitions that we believe will provide meaningful opportunities to grow our business and improve profitability. Acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, productivity, or otherwise perform as we expect. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies as well as difficulties in integrating acquired businesses. While we believe that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we can give no assurance that acquisitions will be successful or accretive to earnings.
Funded status of pension plans  Recognition of pension liabilities may cause a significant reduction in stockholders equity.
Current accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) require balance sheet recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. If the fair value of our pension plans assets at a future reporting date decreases or if the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation (PBO) as of that date decreases, we will be required to record the incremental change in the excess of PBO over the fair value of the assets as a reduction of stockholders equity. The resulting non-cash after-tax charge would not reduce reported earnings as this amount would represent future expense. It would be recorded directly as a decrease in the Other Comprehensive Income component of stockholders equity. While we cannot estimate the future funded status of our pension liability with any certainty at this time, we believe that if the market value of assets or the discount rate used to calculate our pension liability materially decreases, the adjustment could significantly reduce our stockholders equity. A significant reduction in stockholders equity may impact our compliance with debt covenants or could cause a downgrade in our credit ratings that could also adversely impact our future cost and speed of borrowing and have an adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We have identified pension assumptions as critical accounting estimates. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Estimates and JudgmentsPension costs and Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Goodwill and other intangible assets  A significant write down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth.
We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year using the business valuation methods required by current accounting standards. These methods include the use of a weighted-average cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangibles as a critical accounting estimate. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Estimates and JudgmentsIntangible assets and goodwill included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Multiemployer Pension Plans We participate in various multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits. In the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that event, we could face a withdrawal liability. Some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability.
Domestic and international economic conditions.
Disruption in the domestic and international equity and financial markets may impact local economies in which we conduct business. We are not able to predict the future impact of other market disruptions on our liquidity and consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Foreign operations  Conditions in foreign countries and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may reduce our reported results of operations.
We have operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, and Australasia. In 2010, approximately 35 percent of our sales were generated by entities operating outside of the United States. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction and translation losses. In addition, our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions, political situations, and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries, as to which we have no control.
6 Table of Contents Interest rates  An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.
At December31, 2010, our variable rate borrowings approximated $170.8 million. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations. Accordingly, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, our annual interest expense would increase by $1.7 million on the $170.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of December31, 2010.
Credit rating  A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs. Our credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. A downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing by increasing the spread over prevailing market rates that we pay for our commercial paper or the fees associated with our bank credit facility. If for any reason the commercial paper market was not available, we would borrow on our existing credit agreements. If these were no longer available to us, we would be required to seek alternative sources of financing. We would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would further increase our borrowing costs.
Raw materials  Raw material cost increases or shortages could adversely affect our results of operations.
As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the availability and cost of raw materials, which are subject to price fluctuations. Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials have occurred in the past and are expected to recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to reflect changes in costs in selling prices for our products. In the past, we have been generally successful in managing increased raw material costs and increasing selling prices when necessary. Past performance may or may not be replicable in the future. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, in addition to terrorist activity and government regulation of environmental emissions, may negatively impact the production or delivery capacity of our raw material suppliers in the chemical and paper industries. This could result in increased raw material costs or supply shortages, which may have a negative impact on our profitability if we are unable to pass along the increased costs in our selling prices or, in the case of a shortage, secure raw materials from alternative sources.
Patents and proprietary technology  Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to acquire and retain intellectual property rights.
Our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop, acquire, and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success, which ability cannot be assured.
Information technology  A failure in our information technology infrastructure or applications could negatively affect our business.
We depend on information technology to record and process customers orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, and maintain the financial accuracy of our business records. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that will redesign and deploy new processes and a common information system across our plants over a period of several years. There can be no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to achieve our goals may impact our ability to (1)process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2)remain in step with the changing needs of the trade, which could result in the loss of customers. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue. Finally, failure or abandonment of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project.
Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.
Numerous other factors over which we may have limited or no control may affect our performance and profitability.
Other factors that may influence our earnings, financial position, and liquidity include: legal and administrative cases and proceedings (whether civil, such as environmental or product related, or criminal), settlements, judgments, and investigations; developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses; adoption of new, or changes in, accounting policies or practices and the application of such policies and practices; changes in business mix; customer and supplier business reorganizations or combinations; increase in cost of debt; ability to retain adequate levels of insurance coverage at acceptable rates; fluctuations in pension and employee benefit costs; loss of significant contract(s); risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new facilities; timely development and successful market acceptance of new products; pricing of competitive products; disruptions in transportation networks; increased participation in potentially less stable emerging markets; reliability of utility services; impact of computer viruses; general or specific economic conditions and the ability and willingness of purchasers to substitute other products for the products that we manufacture; financial condition and inventory strategies of customers and suppliers; credit risks; changes in customer order patterns; employee work stoppagesat plants; increased competition; changes in government regulations and the impact of changes in the world political environment, including the ability to estimate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on financial results; the impact of epidemiological events on the economy and on our customers and suppliers; and acts of war, terrorism, weather, and other natural disasters.
ITEM 1B  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
7 Table of Contents ITEM 2  PROPERTIES Properties utilized by the Company at December 31, 2010, were as follows: Flexible Packaging Segment This segment has 73 manufacturing plants located in 18 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and eleven non-US countries, of which 62 are owned directly by the Company or its subsidiaries and eleven are leased from outside parties. Initial lease terms generally provide for minimum terms of five to 21 years and have one or more renewal options. The initial term of leases in effect at December31, 2010, expire between 2011 and 2026.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Segment This segment has seven manufacturing plants located in three states and two non-US countries, all of which are owned directly by the Company or its subsidiaries.

The executive offices of the Company, which are leased, are located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including environmental related litigation. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, except as discussed below, that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Environmental Matters The Company is a potentially responsible party (PRP) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws in proceedings associated with seventeen sites around the United States. These proceedings were instituted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies at various times beginning in 1983. Superfund and similar state laws create liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances in the environment. Under these statutes, joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators, site owners and operators, and others regardless of fault. Although these regulations could require the Company to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment at various sites, perform remediation work at such sites, orpay damages for loss of use and non-use values, we expect the Companys liability in these proceedings to be limited to monetary damages. The Company expects its future liability relative to these sites to be insignificant, individually and in the aggregate. The Company has reserved an amount that it believes to be adequate to cover its exposure.
So Paulo Tax Dispute Dixie Toga S.A., acquired by the Company on January5, 2005, is involved in a tax dispute with the City of So Paulo, Brazil. The City imposes a tax on the rendering of printing services. The City has assessed this city services tax on the production and sale of printed labels and packaging products. Dixie Toga, along with a number of other packaging companies, disagree and contend that the city services tax is not applicable to its products and that the products are subject only to the state value added tax (VAT). Under Brazilian law, state VAT and city services tax are mutually exclusive and the same transaction can be subject to only one of those taxes. Based on a ruling from the State of So Paulo, advice from legal counsel, and long standing business practice, Dixie Toga appealed the city services tax and instead continued to collect and pay only the state VAT.
The City of So Paulo disagreed and assessed Dixie Toga the city services tax for the years 1991-1995. The assessments for those years are estimated to be approximately $65.8 million at the date the Company acquired Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2010 exchange rate. Dixie Toga challenged the assessments and ultimately litigated the issue in two annulment actions filed on November24, 1998 and August16, 1999 in the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo. A decision by the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo in 2002 cancelled all of the assessments for the years 1991-1995. The City of So Paulo, the State of So Paulo, and Dixie Toga had each appealed parts of the lower court decision. On February8, 2010, the So Paulo Court of Justice issued a Decision in favor of Dixie Toga. This Decision has been appealed by the City of So Paulo. In the event of a successful appeal by the City and an adverse resolution, the estimated amount for these years could be substantially increased for additional interest, monetary adjustments and costs from the date of acquisition.
The City has also asserted the applicability of the city services tax for the subsequent years 1996-2001 and has issued assessments for those years for Dixie Toga and for Itap Bemis Ltda., a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The assessments for those years were upheld at the administrative level and are being challenged by the companies. The assessments at the date of acquisition for these years for tax and penalties (exclusive of interest and monetary adjustments) are estimated to be approximately $9.9 million for Itap Bemis and $32.0 million for Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2010 exchange rate. In the event of an adverse resolution, the estimated amounts for these years could be increased by $47.4 million for Itap Bemis and $137.2 million for Dixie Toga for interest, monetary adjustments and costs.
The 1996-2001 assessments for Dixie Toga are currently being challenged in the courts. In pursuing its challenge through the courts, taxpayers are generally required, in accordance with court procedures, to pledge assets as security for its lawsuits. Under certain circumstances, taxpayers may avoid the requirement to pledge assets. Dixie Toga has secured a court injunction that avoids the current requirement to pledge assets as security for its lawsuit related to the 1996-2001 assessments.
8 Table of Contents The City has also asserted the applicability of the city services tax for the subsequent years 2004-2009. The assessments issued by the City for these years have been received and are being challenged by the Company at the administrative level. The assessments for tax, penalties, and interest are estimated to be approximately $32.6 million, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2010 exchange rate.
The Company strongly disagrees with the Citys position and intends to vigorously challenge any assessments by the City of So Paulo. The Company is unable at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of the controversy and as such has not recorded any liability related to this matter. An adverse resolution could be material to the consolidated results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved.
Brazil Investigation On September18, 2007, the Secretariat of Economic Law (SDE), a governmental agency in Brazil, initiated an investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the Brazilian flexible packaging industry against a number of Brazilian companies including a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The investigation relates to periods prior to the Companys acquisition of control of Dixie Toga and its subsidiaries. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the Company is unable at the present time to predict the outcome of this matter.
Other The Company is currently not otherwise subject to any pending litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of the Company.

$ 205.1 4.2 % $ 147.2 4.2 % $ 166.2 4.4 % Effective income tax rate 35.9 % 36.5 % 35.9 % Overview Bemis Company,Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets. Generally about 65 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 90 percent of our net sales. Our remaining net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets.
Market Conditions The markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive. The primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins, films, paper, ink, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals. During 2010, the cost of these raw materials generally increased, creating a short-term negative impact on gross margins as a percentage of net sales. This compares to an environment of decreasing raw material costs which created a short-term positive impact on gross margins during 2009.
Acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas On March1, 2010, Bemis completed its acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of Rio Tinto plc. Under the terms of the $1.2 billion transaction, Bemis acquired 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand, which recorded 2009 net sales totaling $1.4 billion. These facilities are included in our flexible packaging business segment and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment Bemis product offerings and technological capabilities. The majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of 2009 through the issuance of $800.0 million of public bonds and 8.2 million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering. The remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market at the time of closing.
Sale of Discontinued Operations Under the terms of an order signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February25, 2010, a portion of the Food Americas business acquired on March1, 2010 was to be divested, and we have classified the related operating results as discontinued operations. On July13, 2010, we sold these discontinued operations to Exopack Holding Corp., an affiliate of private investment firm Sun Capital Partners,Inc. The transaction was completed for a cash purchase price, net of selling costs, of $75.2 million. The divested business recorded 2009 net sales of approximately $156 million and included two facilities which manufacture flexible packaging for retail natural cheese and shrink bags for fresh red meat.
Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (inmillions,exceptpershareamounts) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 4,835.0 $ 3,514.6 $ 3,779.4 Net income attributable to Bemis   Company,Inc.
205.1 147.2 166.2 Diluted earnings per share 1.85 1.38 1.61 11 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 Net sales for the year ended December31, 2010 increased by 37.6 percent. We estimate that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 31 percent during the year. The effect of currency translations accounted for a 1.8 percent increase in net sales. Net of these impacts, the increase in net sales primarily reflects higher prices and improved unit sales volume from both existing and acquired operations. Selling prices were increased during 2010 in response to higher raw material costs.
Diluted earnings per share for 2010 of $1.85 included a $0.09 charge for transaction related legal, accounting and other professional fees, a $0.09 charge associated with purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog, as well as a $0.05 charge for acquisition related integration costs including severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs. In addition, the pre-closing impact of the July2009 financing of the Food Americas acquisition reduced 2010 diluted earnings by $0.06 per share. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.02 in 2010. For the year ended December31, 2009, diluted earnings per share included a $0.50 per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees, acquisition financing, and an administrative sales tax assessment, and severance charges, partially offset by a $0.02 per share gain on the sale of an asset. Operating results for the year ended December31, 2010 improved with increased unit sales volume, currency translation benefits, and the accretive effect of the Food Americas acquisition.
2009 versus 2008 For the year ended December31, 2009, net sales decreased 7.0 percent. The effect of currency translation decreased net sales by 3.3 percent in 2009, while the June2009 acquisition of a flexible packaging company in South America contributed 1.3 percent to net sales growth. Net of these impacts, the decline in net sales during 2009 primarily reflects lower unit sales volumes in both business segments.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.38 for 2009, a 14.3 percent decrease compared to $1.61 per share for 2008. For the year ended December31, 2009, diluted earnings per share included a $0.50 per share charge representing the impact of acquisition related professional fees, acquisition financing, and administrative sales tax assessment, and severance charges, partially offset by a $0.02 per share gain on the sale of an asset. Operating results for the year ended December31, 2009 benefited from an increased proportion of net sales of value added products and decreasing input costs during the first half of the year.
Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including applications for meat and cheese, confectionery and snack, frozen foods, lawn and garden, health and hygiene, beverages, healthcare, bakery, and dry foods.
(dollarsinmillions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 4,272.4 $ 2,983.4 $ 3,153.2 Operating profit (See Note 19 to the Consolidated   Financial Statements) 474.9 385.3 315.9 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 11.1 % 12.9 % 10.0 % 2010 versus 2009 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased 43.2 percent in 2010. Acquisitions increased net sales by approximately 36 percent, and currency effects accounted for a sales increase of 2.4 percent. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher sales across many market categories.
Operating profit increased to $474.9 million, or 11.1 percent of net sales, in 2010, compared to $385.3 million, or 12.9 percent of net sales in 2009. The net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in 2010 by $6.5 million compared to 2009. The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 reflects the combined impact of generally lower operating margins from the acquired business and the short-term negative impact of higher raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments. In addition, operating profit includes $20.1 million of acquisition related charges. Operating margins in 2009 benefited from decreasing raw material costs during the first half of that year.
2009 versus 2008 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment decreased 5.4 percent in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a sales decline of 3.3 percent compared to 2008 and the South American rigid operations of Huhtamaki Oyj, acquired in June2009, accounted for $49.6 million of 2009 net sales following the acquisition, increasing net sales by 1.6 percent. The remaining 3.7 percent decrease in net sales reflects both lower selling prices and unit sales volume. Generally lower net sales of flexible packaging reflected decreased consumer demand.
Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9 percent in 2009 from 10.0 percent in 2008. This improvement reflects the combined impact of improved sales mix and production efficiency initiatives, as well as lower input costs experienced during the first half of 2009. The improvement in sales mix during 2009 is attributable to an increased proportion of net sales represented by value-added packaging which incorporates consumer convenience features and extends shelf life. Net sales of packaging for less complex applications generally experienced the largest unit volume decrease during 2009. In comparison, operating margins during 2008 were negatively impacted by dramatic increases in raw material costs during the summer months.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and 12 Table of Contents technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, construction and medical industries.
Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs.
(dollarsinmillions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 562.6 $ 531.2 $ 626.2 Operating profit (See Note 19 to the Consolidated   Financial Statements) 33.0 13.6 34.3 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales 5.9 % 2.6 % 5.5 % 2010 versus 2009 For the total year 2010, net sales of pressure sensitive materials were $562.6 million, a 5.9 percent increase from net sales in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of 1.6 percent. The resulting 7.5 percent increase in net sales reflects the increase in unit sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 when economic conditions negatively impacted demand for our pressure sensitive materials products.
The net effect of currency translation decreased operating profit by $0.7 million in 2010. Higher operating profit in 2010 reflects the positive impact of substantially improved unit sales volumes combined with disciplined cost management.
2009 versus 2008 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of 15.2 percent in 2009. Currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of 3.2 percent. The balance of the decrease reflects dramatically lower unit sales volumes compared to 2008. The markets for our graphic and technical products, which represent about 40 percent of total business segment sales, experienced significant demand declines in light of weak global economic conditions, resulting in net sales declines for those products in excess of 20.0 percent.
Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting the decline in unit sales volumes, particularly in high value added graphic and technical product lines. Operating profit in 2009 includes severance charges totaling $2.6 million related to workforce reductions intended to better match capacity levels with current production needs.
Consolidated Gross Profit (dollarsinmillions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross profit $ 889.5 $ 700.2 $ 648.0 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 18.4 % 19.9 % 17.1 % Gross profit in 2010 reflects the negative impact of $15.4 million of expenses associated with the purchase accounting impact of the fair value write-up of inventory and a charge for the fair value of the customer order backlog, both related to the Food Americas acquisition. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2010 is attributable to lower operating margins in the newly acquired Food Americas business combined with increasing raw material costs during 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2009 benefited from declining raw material costs for the first half of that year, resulting in a substantial improvement in this ratio compared to 2008.
Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollarsinmillions) 2010 2009 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses   (SG&A) $ 455.4 $ 370.9 $ 342.7 SG&A as a percentage of net sales 9.4 % 10.5 % 9.0 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased during 2010 reflecting the increased costs associated with the newly acquired Food Americas business, including $4.6 million of expenses primarily related to severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs. Expenses in 2009 increased from the prior year as a result of higher benefit and incentive plan costs during that year. The increase in the ratio of these expenses to net sales in 2009 was magnified by lower sales levels for the year ended December31, 2009 as selling prices were adjusted downward to reflect decreasing raw material costs in 2009.
Other Expenses (dollarsinmillions) 2010 2009 2008 Research and development (R&D) $ 34.3 $ 24.3 $ 25.0 R&D as a percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Interest expense 73.5 42.1 39.4 Effective interest rate 5.8 % 4.3 % 4.8 % Other operating (income) expense, net (1.0 ) 24.7 (14.0 ) Other non-operating (income) expense, net (2.1 ) (13.7 ) Income taxes 117.6 87.8 96.3 13 Table of Contents 2010 2009 2008 Effective tax rate 35.9 % 36.5 % 35.9 % Research and Development Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold.
Interest Expense Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the July2009 issuance of $800 million of long-term bonds as financing for the Food Americas acquisition.
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net For the year 2010, other operating income and expense included $15.9 million of fiscal incentive income compared to $16.6 million in 2009 and $19.8 million in 2008. Fiscal government incentives relate to certain flexible packaging locations and are considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit. These fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in South America and are expected to continue over the next few years. In 2010, the fiscal incentive income was offset by $15.6 million of charges principally associated with the Food Americas acquisition. During 2009, in addition to the fiscal incentive income, other operating income and expense included $44.8 million of acquisition related expenses.
Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net The decrease in other non-operating income, net, is primarily due to lower interest income combined with net foreign exchange losses in 2010. In 2008, increased levels of interest income reflected higher cash balances invested outside of the United States.
Income Taxes The difference between our overall tax rate of 35.9 percent in 2010, 36.5 percent in 2009, and 35.9 percent in 2008 and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests primarily represent the outstanding preferred shares of Dixie Toga, our Brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt to Total Capitalization Net debt to total capitalization (which includes total debt net of cash balances plus equity) was 38.9 percent at December31, 2010, compared to 39.2 percent at December31, 2009, and 31.7 percent at December31, 2008. The December31, 2009 calculation of net debt to total capitalization excluded $1.0 billion of cash on hand related to the acquisition financing proceeds received in advance of the March1, 2010 closing of the Food Americas acquisition. Total debt was $1,286.5 million, $1,258.8 million, and $686.6 million, at December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The increase in debt during 2009 reflects $800.0 million of public bonds issued in July2009 in anticipation of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas acquisition, offset by a reduction in commercial paper and other debt outstanding.
Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest.
Net Cash Flow from Operations Net cash provided by operations was $368.0 million for the year ended December31, 2010, compared to $475.8 million in 2009 and $293.6 million in 2008. Changes in working capital had a significant impact on cash provided by operations during the years presented. Lower raw material costs during 2009 reduced overall working capital needs compared to 2008, while increasing raw material costs negatively impacted working capital levels during 2010. Net cash provided by operations was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $15.0 million, $30.0 million, and $2.3 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Required contributions for our U.S. pension plans are expected to be less than $5.0 million in 2011.
Available Financing In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs. At year-end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $158.8 million. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets.
Under the terms of our revolving credit agreement, we have the capacity to borrow up to $625 million. This facility is principally used as back-up for our commercial paper program. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The revolving credit agreement includes a $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. At December31, 2010, a total of $4.0 million of multicurrency loans were outstanding on the revolving credit facility. If this revolving credit facility were no longer available to us, we would expect to 14 Table of Contents meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate.
Commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2010, has been classified as long-term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The related back-up revolving credit agreement expires on April28, 2013.
Liquidity Outlook On December31, 2010, our revolving credit facility supported total commercial paper outstanding of $158.8 million, industrial revenue bonds outstanding of $8.0 million, and multicurrency loans outstanding of $4.0 million. As a result, we had the capacity to borrow an additional $454.2 million under the credit facility as of December31, 2010.
Management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. In addition, increases in raw material costs would increase our short term liquidity needs.
Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $113.2 million during 2010, compared to $89.2 million in 2009, and $120.5 million in 2008. Over the next several years, we expect average annual capital expenditures to be less than total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. We expect to fund 2011 capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities.
Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2.2 percent during the first quarter of 2010 to 23 cents per share from 22.5 cents per share. This follows increases of 2.3 percent in 2009 and 4.8 percent in 2008. In February2011, the Board of Directors approved the 28 th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 24 cents per share, a 4.3 percent increase.
Share Repurchases During 2010, we purchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock in the open market. Due to the ongoing negotiation of the Food Americas acquisition, no shares were repurchased during 2009. During 2008, we purchased 1.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market. As of December31, 2010, we were authorized to purchase up to 9.5 million additional shares of our common stock for the treasury.
Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, operating lease obligations, and certain other purchase obligations as of December31, 2010. Capital leases are insignificant.
Contractual Payments Due by Period Lessthan 1to3 3to5 Morethan (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long-term debt obligations (1) $ 1,288.0 $ 2.9 $ 484.9 400.2 $ 400.0 Interest expense (2) 355.1 66.7 112.3 78.2 97.9 Operating leases (3) 40.1 8.9 12.6 7.7 10.9 Purchase obligations (4) 298.5 296.9 0.8 0.8 Postretirement obligations (5) 60.2 2.5 26.6 14.2 16.9 Total $ 2,041.9 $ 377.9 $ 637.2 $ 500.3 $ 526.5 Pursuant to current authoritative accounting guidance, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(1) These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on April28, 2013.
(2) A portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates. The amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at December31, 2010.
(3) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements.
(4) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services.
(5) Postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded Bemis Supplemental Retirement Plan. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations.
15 Table of Contents Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates.
A portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short-term interest rates. As such, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $170.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by $1.7 million.
Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December31, 2010 and 2009, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $12.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other operating (income) expense, net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability. Amounts recognized in income related to forward exchange contracts were $1.3 million income and $4.0 million income in the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Our business in Brazil holds U.S. dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the Brazilian real. In order to hedge this exposure, we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt, effectively converting a portion of the U.S. denominated debt to the local currency. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December31, 2010, and December31, 2009, the Company had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $86.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long-term asset or liability and as an expense element of other operating (income) expense, net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses. Amounts recognized in income related to these currency swaps were $6.9 million expense and $7.9 million expense in the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of $62.1 million in 2010 and a decrease of $125.8 million in 2009. Operating profit increased by approximately $5.8 million in 2010 and decreased by $9.4 million in 2009 as a result of foreign currency translation.
Shareholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts. The impact of currency translation during 2010 was an increase in shareholders equity totaling $23.0 million.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and  The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill.
Pension costs Amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. The accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. Net periodic pension cost recorded in 2010 was $26.5 million, compared to pension cost of $18.8 million in 2009 and $10.5 million in 2008.
One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rulesis the expected return on plan assets. For the year 2010, we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of 70 percent of total assets and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. For the historical long-term investment periods of 10, 15, 20 and 25 years ending December31, 2010, our pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of 2.0 percent, 7.3 percent, 8.5 percent, and 8.7 percent, respectively. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our 16 Table of Contents outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long-term rates of return and, based on their results, we have determined our assumptions to be reasonable.
This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense.
At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December31, 2010, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 5.25 percent, a decrease of one half of one percent from the 5.75 percent rate used at December31, 2009. For our non-U.S. pension plans, we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates to be used in our actuarial calculations in each individual country.
Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 5.25 percent for the discount rate and 8.25 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2011 to be in a range of $33 million to $37 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2011 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on assets.

The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate.

Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $1.0 billion as of December31, 2010.
Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review 17 Table of Contents these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition, and amounts of future cash flows.
New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Guidance Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures In January2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued additional authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance requires that information be provided about asset movements among Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, requires expanded disclosures in the roll forward of Level 3 activity, and provides clarifications on certain existing disclosure requirements. The majority of the guidance was effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009 and did not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures A portion of the guidance issued by the FASB in January2010 referenced above, related to expanded disclosures in the roll forward of Level 3 activity, is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2010. This portion of the guidance will expand the Companys disclosures and will not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Forward-looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward-looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward-looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs and availability, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; the magnitude and volatility of price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers in selling prices or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; changes in the availability of financing; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; unexpected costs or manufacturing issues related to the implementation of an enterprise resource system; costs associated with the pursuit of business combinations; unexpected costs associated with acquisitions or divestitures; changes in governmental regulations, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings and any related proceedings or civil lawsuits; unexpected outcomes in our current and future domestic and international tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form10-K and our quarterly reports on Form10-Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statement.
18 Table of Contents ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item 7A is included in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange, currency swaps, and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position and liquidity. The effect on our consolidated results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Managements Responsibility Statement The management of Bemis Company,Inc. is responsible for the integrity, objectivity, and accuracy of the financial statements of the Company. The financial statements are prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and using managements best estimates and judgments, where appropriate. The financial information presented throughout this Annual Report on Form10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.
The management of Bemis Company,Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f). Under the direction, supervision, and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Companys management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-Framework). Based on the results of this evaluation management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2010. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions published guidance, the Companys assessment of internal control over financial reporting excluded the 2010 acquisition of the Alcan Food Americas business, which represents approximately 23 percent of net sales for the year ended December31, 2010 and 34 percent of total assets as of December31, 2010. Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form10-K contains managements favorable assessment of internal controls over financial reporting based on their review and evaluation utilizing the COSO-Framework criteria.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets quarterly with management, the Internal Audit Director, the Director of Global Financial Compliance, and independent accountants to review the work of each and to satisfy itself that the respective parties are properly discharging their responsibilities. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Director of Global Financial Compliance, and the Internal Audit Director have had and continue to have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, without the presence of Company management.
Henry   J. Theisen Scott   B. Ullem Stanley   A. Jaffy President   and Vice   President and Vice   President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer Controller 19 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bemis Company,Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of equity and of cash flow present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bemis Company,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A in this Annual Report. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the 2010 acquisition of the Alcan Food Americas business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2010. We have also excluded the 2010 acquisition of the Alcan Food Americas business from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The acquired Alcan Food Americas business consists of wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues represent 23 percent of net sales and 34 percent of total assets of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2010.

24 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1  BUSINESS DESCRIPTION Bemis Company,Inc., a Missouri corporation, was founded in 1858 and incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company. In 1965 the name was changed to Bemis Company,Inc. (the Company). Based in Neenah, Wisconsin, the Company employs approximately 19,800 individuals and has 80 manufacturing facilities. The Company manufactures and sells flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
On March1, 2010, Bemis completed its acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of Rio Tinto plc. Under the terms of the $1.2 billion transaction, Bemis acquired 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand, which recorded 2009 net sales totaling $1.4 billion. These facilities are included in our flexible packaging business segment and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment Bemis product offerings and technological capabilities.
The Companys business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging, which accounted for approximately 88 percent of 2010 net sales, and Pressure Sensitive Materials, which accounted for the remaining net sales. The Companys flexible packaging business has a strong technical base in polymer chemistry, film extrusion, coating, laminating, printing, and converting. The Companys pressure sensitive materials business specializes in adhesive technologies. The primary markets for the Companys products are in the food industry, which accounted for approximately 65 percent of net sales. The Companys flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets include chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care products, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality, and service.
Note 2  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Joint ventures which are not majority controlled are accounted for by the equity method of accounting with earnings of $2.1 million, $2.2 million, and $0.9 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively, included in other operating (income) expense, net, on the accompanying consolidated statement of income. Investments in joint ventures are included in deferred charges and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Noncontrolling interests: As of December31, 2010, the Company held 100 percent of the outstanding voting common stock and 54 percent of the outstanding non-voting preferred stock of Dixie Toga S.A. The remaining non-voting preferred shares not held by the Company are traded publicly on the Brazilian BM&FBovespa Stock Exchange in So Paulo, Brazil, and represent the most significant component of noncontrolling interests included on our consolidated balance sheet.
Estimates and assumptions required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Translation of foreign currencies: The Company considers the local currency to be the functional currency for substantially all foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. All revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. Translation gains or losses are recorded in the foreign currency translation component in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $(0.9) million, $1.4 million, and $(6.8) million in 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively, are included as a component of other operating (income) expense, net. Additionally in 2010, foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $(2.6) million are included as a component of other non-operating (income) expense, net.
Revenue recognition: Sales and related costs of sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. These conditions are typically fulfilled upon shipment of products. All costs associated with revenue, including customer volume discounts, are recognized at the time of sale. Customer volume discounts are accrued in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance and recorded as a reduction to sales. Shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of costs of sales while amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as a component of sales. The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs when specific issues are identified and the amounts are determinable.
Environmental cost: The Company is involved in a number of environmental related disputes and claims. The Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Our reserve for environmental liabilities at December31, 2010 and 2009 was $4.4 million and $0.4 million respectively. Adjustments to the reserve accounts and costs which were directly expensed for environmental remediation matters resulted in charges to the income statements for 2010, 2009, and 2008 of $0.0 million, $0.0 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. There were no third party reimbursements for any of the years presented.
Research and development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid temporary investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposit that can be readily liquidated without penalty at the Companys option. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair market value.
25 Table of Contents Accounts receivable: Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for sales returns and the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The following factors are considered when determining the collectibility of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experience, current economic industry trends, and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on managements assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $27.5 million and $21.1 million at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Inventory valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market. Inventories are summarized at December31, as follows: (inthousands) 2010 2009 Raw materials and supplies $ 249,782 $ 139,821 Work in process and finished goods 458,281 280,975 Total inventories, gross 708,063 420,796 Less inventory write-downs (34,200 ) (21,729 ) Total inventories, net $ 673,863 $ 399,067 Property and equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Plant and equipment are depreciated for financial reporting purposes principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets as follows: land improvements, 15-30 years; buildings, 15-45 years; leasehold and building improvements, the lesser of the lease term or 8-20 years; and machinery and equipment, 3-16 years. For tax purposes, the Company generally uses accelerated methods of depreciation. The tax effect of the difference between book and tax depreciation has been provided as deferred income taxes. Depreciation expense was $191.6 million, $150.8 million, and $153.0 million, for 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively. On sale or retirement, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reflected in income. Interest costs which are capitalized during the construction of major capital projects totaled $0.0 million in 2010, $1.1 million in 2009, and $2.6 million in 2008.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value.
The Company capitalizes direct costs (internal and external) of materials and services used in the development and purchase of internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three to twelve years and are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within property and equipment.
The Company is in the process of developing and implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Certain costs incurred during the application development stage have been capitalized in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance related to accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use. These costs are amortized over the systems estimated useful life as the ERP system is placed in service. As of December31, 2010, capitalized costs for this new ERP system were $84.8 million.
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment and whenever there is an impairment indicator, using a fair-value based approach.
Intangible assets: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are being amortized against income using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, with original periods ranging from one to 30 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever there is an impairment indicator. Intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations to net book value.
Financial instruments: The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders equity through other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized. Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized through earnings in the current period. Note 7 contains expanded details relating to specific derivative instruments included on the Companys balance sheet, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency swap contracts, and interest rate swap arrangements.
Treasury stock: Repurchased common stock is stated at cost and is presented as a separate reduction of shareholders equity. At December31, 2010, 9.5 million common shares can be repurchased, at managements discretion, under authority granted by the Companys Board of Directors in 2010.
26 Table of Contents Note 3  NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Accounting Guidance Adopted in the Year Ended December31, 2010 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures In January2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued additional authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance requires that information be provided about asset movements among Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, requires expanded disclosures in the roll forward of Level 3 activity, and provides clarifications on certain existing disclosure requirements. The majority of the guidance was effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009 and did not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures A portion of the guidance issued by the FASB in January2010 referenced above, related to expanded disclosures in the roll forward of Level 3 activity, is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2010. This portion of the guidance will expand the Companys disclosures and will not impact its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Note 4  ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of Alcan Packaging Food Americas On March1, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, a business unit of Rio Tinto plc. Under the terms of the $1.2 billion transaction, the Company acquired 23 Food Americas flexible packaging facilities in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and New Zealand, with 2009 net sales of $1.4 billion. These facilities produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment the Companys product offerings and technological capabilities. The acquisition was completed through the purchase of the assets of Pechiney Plastic Packaging,Inc., AP Food Americas, LLC, and Alcan Packaging Canada,Ltd. and through the purchase of the outstanding shares of Alcan Packaging Mexico, S.A. De C.V., Alcan Empaques Mexico, S.A. De C.V., Alcan Packaging Thermaplate,Inc., Danaflex Packaging Corporation Limited, Alcan Embalagens Do Brasil Ltda., Envaril Plastic Packaging S.R.L., and Envatrip S.A.
In compliance with regulatory requirements for approval of the transaction in the United States, the Company was obligated to divest a portion of the acquired business, which included two facilities. This portion of the business was related primarily to sales of flexible packaging for retail natural cheese products and shrink bag packaging for fresh meat products. The sale of this portion of the business was completed on July13, 2010 as discussed in Note 5  Discontinued Operations. The 2009 annual net sales associated with the sold business were approximately $156 million. Operating results associated with this sold business have been classified on the consolidated statement of income as income from discontinued operations, net of tax.
The total purchase price for the acquisition was as follows: (inthousands) Cash consideration $ 1,194,711 Payable to seller for working capital purchase   price adjustments 16,248 Assumption of liabilities of seller 7,046 $ 1,218,005 Certain customary working capital adjustments were made to the purchase price in the fourth quarter of 2010. The majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of 2009 through the issuance of $800.0 million of public bonds and 8.2 million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering. The remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market in advance of closing. The Company incurred $59.4 million in acquisition-related fees which were recorded in other operating expense in the consolidated statement of income, of which $15.6 million were incurred in the year ended December31, 2010 and $43.8 million were incurred in the year ended December31, 2009.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company is in the process of finalizing fair market valuations which may require adjustments to the purchase price allocation. The preliminary allocation resulted in goodwill of approximately $354.2 million, which is attributed to business synergies and intangible assets that do not meet the criteria for separate recognition. The Company expects that approximately $308.5 million of this goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. Other long-term assets include approximately $17.9 million of assets related to the indemnity provisions of the sale and purchase agreement, and are primarily related to tax matters. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: March1, (inthousands) 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 22,090 Accounts receivable, net 146,088 Inventories 179,536 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 8,291 Working capital of discontinued operations 8,452 Property and equipment 457,885 Goodwill 354,154 Other intangible assets 130,300 Long-term assets of discontinued operations 63,985 Other long-term assets 19,693 27 Table of Contents March1, (inthousands) 2010 Accounts payable (125,678 ) Accrued salaries and wages (12,088 ) Accrued income and other taxes 139 Deferred income taxes (2,610 ) Long-term liabilities (32,232 ) $ 1,218,005 The determination of fair value for acquired intangible assets was primarily based upon the discounted expected cash flows. The determination of useful life was based upon historical acquisition experience, economic factors, and future cash flows of the assets acquired. The amortization expense related to these intangible assets for 2010 was approximately $9.1 million, using straight-line amortization. The fair values and useful lives that have been assigned to the acquired identifiable intangible assets follow: (inthousands) UsefulLife FairValue Customer relationships 20 years $ 87,300 Technology 15 years 39,700 Order backlog One month 3,300 Total $ 130,300 The results of the acquired operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. In accordance with current accounting guidance, income from discontinued operations does not include depreciation or amortization expense. The amount of net sales directly attributable to the acquired operations included in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $1.1 billion. We are unable to reasonably separate the impact the acquisition had on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 as the acquired business has been integrated with the previously existing operations of the Company. The manufacture of certain acquired and existing products has been moved between plants of the acquired business and existing operations, and various sales, general and administrative functions have been combined, making the disclosure impracticable.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009 reflects the results of operations as if the acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging had been completed on January1, 2010 and January1, 2009, respectively. Pro forma adjustments have been made for the elimination of sales of discontinued operations and changes in depreciation and amortization expenses related to the valuation of the acquired fixed and intangible assets and assumed liabilities at fair value, the addition of incremental interest costs related to debt used to finance the acquisition, and the tax benefits related to the increased costs.

It is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations actually would have been had we completed the acquisition as of the beginning of each year, nor does it purport to project the future operating results of the Company.

Acquisition of South American Rigid Packaging Operations of Huhtamaki Oyj On June3, 2009, the Company announced that it acquired the South American rigid packaging operations of Huhtamaki Oyj, a global manufacturer of consumer and specialty packaging. This rigid packaging business, which includes three facilities in Brazil and one facility in Argentina, recorded annual net sales of approximately $86.0 million in 2008, primarily to dairy and food service markets. The purchase price of $43.0 million was paid with a combination of $32.3 million cash on hand, $1.9 million of debt assumed, and an $8.8 million note payable to the seller. The note payable to seller matured on May31, 2010 and has been paid. The fair values of assets and liabilities acquired were $51.7 million and $10.9 million, respectively.
Note 5  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As discussed in Note 4 - Acquisitions, we were obligated to divest a portion of the acquired Alcan Packaging Food Americas business in the United States in order to comply with regulatory requirements for approval of the transaction. This portion of the business included two facilities and was primarily related to the production and sales of flexible packaging for retail natural cheese products and 28 Table of Contents shrink bag packaging for fresh meat products. The sale of this portion of the business was completed on July13, 2010 for net cash proceeds of approximately $75.2 million. Prior to the sale, the assets and liabilities for these operations were segregated as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet. The pre-sale goodwill and intangible assets values were adjusted to reflect our updated estimate of fair value of the assets of the discontinued operations less estimated selling costs as of March1, 2010. This resulted in no gain or loss on the sale of discontinued operations.
From the March1, 2010, date of the Food Americas acquisition, through the July13, 2010 sale date, the operating results associated with this portion of the acquired business were classified as discontinued operations. In accordance with current accounting guidance, income from discontinued operations does not include depreciation or amortization expense. The operating results of the discontinued operations from March1, 2010 through July13, 2010 included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2010 follow: YearEnded (inthousands) December31,2010 Net sales $ 54,950 Income before income taxes $ 2,782 Provision for income taxes (1,000 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 1,782 Note 6  FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE The fair values of the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
The Companys non-derivative financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Fair value disclosures are classified based on the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 fair value measurements represent exchange-traded securities which are valued at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access as of the reporting date. Level 2 fair value measurements are determined using input prices that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Level 3 fair value measurements are determined using unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.
Since June30, 2010, the fair value measurements of the Companys long-term debt, including current maturities, primarily represent exchange-traded securities which are valued at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access as of the reporting date. Prior to June30, 2010, the Company used discounted cash flow analyses to estimate fair value based on the incremental borrowing rates available to the Company for similar debt with similar terms and maturity. The carrying values and estimated fair values of long-term debt, including current maturities, at December31, 2010 and 2009 follow: December31,2010 December31,2009 Carrying FairValue Carrying FairValue (inthousands) Value (Level2) Value (Level3) Total long-term debt $ 1,285,674 $ 1,388,019 $ 1,250,030 $ 1,303,760 The fair values for derivatives are based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The financial assets and financial liabilities are primarily valued using standard calculations / models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are the primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes.

The Company enters into derivative transactions to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders equity 29 Table of Contents through other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized. Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized through earnings in the current period.
The Company enters into currency swap contracts that are not hedges to manage changes in the fair value of U.S. dollar denominated debt held in Brazil. The contracts effectively convert a portion of that debt to the functional currency of its Brazilian operation. These currency swap contracts generally have maturities that match the maturities of the underlying debt. The Company has not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December31, 2010, and December31, 2009, the Company had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $86.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively. The fair value related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long-term asset or liability and as an element of other operating (income) expense, net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses.
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months and relate primarily to major Western European currencies for our European operations, the U.S. dollar for our Brazilian operations, and the U.S. and Australian dollars for our New Zealand operations. The Company has not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December31, 2010, and December31, 2009, the Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $12.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to active forward exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long-term asset or liability and as an element of other operating (income) expense, net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties in currency swap and forward exchange contracts. Collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of the Company. In the event a counterparty fails to meet the contractual terms of a currency swap or forward exchange contract, the Companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instrument. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company has not had any historical instances of non-performance by any counterparties, nor does it anticipate any future instances of non-performance.

Estimated annual amortization expense is $15.4 million for 2011, $14.2 million for 2012, and $12.9 million for the years 2013 through 2015. The Company completed its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2010 with no indications of impairment of goodwill found. The Company does not have any accumulated impairment losses.
Note 9  PENSION PLANS Total multiemployer plan, defined contribution, and defined benefit pension expense in 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $44.8 million, $29.1 million, and $16.9 million, respectively. The Company sponsors a 401(k)savings plan (a defined contribution plan) for substantially all U.S. employees. The Company contributes $0.50 for every pre-tax $1.00 an employee contributes on the first two percent of eligible compensation plus $0.25 for every pre-tax $1.00 an employee contributes on the next six percent of eligible compensation. Company contributions are invested in Company stock and are fully vested after three years of service. Total Company contributions for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $8.2 million, $6.6 million, and $6.4 million, respectively.
Effective January1, 2006, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two-thirds of the participant population. For those employees impacted, future pension benefits were replaced with the Bemis Investment Profit Sharing Plan (BIPSP), a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the Company. Total contribution expense for BIPSP and previously existing defined contribution plans was $17.0 million in 2010, $9.5 million in 2009, and $5.7 million in 2008. Multiemployer plans cover employees at four different manufacturing locations and provide for contributions to union administered defined benefit pension plans. Amounts charged to pension cost and contributed to the multiemployer plans in 2010, 2009, and 2008 totaled $1.3 million, $0.8 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.
The Companys defined benefit pension plans continue to cover a substantial number of U.S. employees, and the non-U.S. defined benefit plans cover select employees at various international locations. The benefits under the plans are based on years of service and salary levels. Certain plans covering hourly employees provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. In addition, the Company also sponsors an unfunded supplemental retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of limits under the federal tax law and increased benefits to reflect a service adjustment factor.

The employer contributions for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, were $19.2 million and $34.4 million respectively. The expected cash contribution for 2011 is $19.8 million which is expected to satisfy plan funding requirements and regulatory funding requirements.
32 Table of Contents For each of the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, the U.S. pension plans represented approximately 90 percent of the Companys total plan assets and approximately 89 percent of the Companys total projected benefit obligation. Considering the significance of the U.S. pension plans in comparison with the Companys total pension plans, we separately present and discuss the critical pension assumptions related to the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. pension plans.
The Companys actuarial valuation date is December31. The weighted-average discount rates and rates of increase in future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the years ended December31 are as follows: U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans 2010 2009 2010 2009 Weighted-average discount rate 5.25 % 5.75 % 5.13 % 5.39 % Rate of increase in future compensation levels 4.25 % 4.25 % 3.73 % 3.92 % The weighted-average discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and rates of increase in future compensation levels used to determine the net benefit cost for the years ended December31 are as follows: U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Weighted-average discount rate 5.75 % 6.00 % 6.25 % 5.42 % 5.82 % 5.60 % Expected return on plan assets 8.25 % 8.25 % 8.50 % 6.25 % 6.16 % 6.18 % Rate of increase in future compensation levels 4.25 % 4.25 % 4.75 % 3.90 % 3.90 % 3.98 % The Pension Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the investments of the pension plans. The overall investment strategy is to achieve a long-term rate of return that maintains an adequate funded ratio and minimizes the need for future contributions through diversification of asset types, investment strategies, and investment managers. A target asset allocation policy is used to balance investments in equity securities with investments in fixed income securities. The majority of pension plan assets relate to U.S. plans and employ a target asset allocation of 70% equity securities and 30% fixed income securities. Equity securities primarily include investments in diversified portfolios of domestic large cap and small cap companies. Fixed income securities include diversified investments across a broad spectrum of primarily investment-grade debt securities.

* The tables presenting the fair value of plan assets do not include a liability related to the U.S. pension plans participation in a securities lending program. The securities lending program authorizes the pension plan trustee to lend securities, which are assets of the pension plans, to approved borrowers. The trustee requires that borrowers, pursuant to a securities lending agreement, deliver collateral to secure each loan. Cash collateral received is invested in collateral funds comprised primarily of high quality, short-term investments. As of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, the value of the loans outstanding exceeded the value of the invested collateral by $5.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered historical returns and future expectations. Using historical long-term investment periods of 10, 15, 20, and 25 years ended December31, 2010, our pension plan assets have earned annualized rates of return of 2.0 percent, 7.3 percent, 8.5 percent, and 8.7 percent, respectively. Using our target asset allocation for plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long-term rates of return and, based on their results, we have determined our assumptions to be reasonable.
At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our U.S. pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, we determined this rate to be 5.25 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively. For our non-U.S. pension plans, we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates to be used in our actuarial calculations in each individual country.
Note 10  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS The Company sponsors several defined postretirement benefit plans that cover a majority of salaried and a portion of nonunion hourly employees. These plans provide health care benefits and, in some instances, provide life insurance benefits. Postretirement health care plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans are noncontributory.

The expected contribution for 2011 is $0.7 million which is expected to satisfy plan funding requirements.
The health care cost trend rate assumption affects the amounts reported. For measurement purposes, the assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was 8.5 percent for 2010 and was 7.5 percent for 2009; each years estimated rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0 percent and remain at that level thereafter. The annual incremental decrease was assumed to be one-half percent for both 2010 and 2009. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care trends would have the following effects: OnePercentage OnePercentage (inthousands) PointIncrease PointDecrease Effect on total of service and interest cost   components for 2010 $ 2 $ (2 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation at   December31, 2010 $ 20 $ (19 ) The Companys actuarial valuation date is December31. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the net postretirement projected benefit obligation for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009 were 5.25 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the net postretirement benefit cost was 5.75 percent, 6.00 percent, and 6.25 percent for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
Note 11  STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS The Companys 2001 and 2007 (adopted in 2006) Stock Incentive Plans provide for the issuance of an aggregate of up to 11,000,000 shares of common stock to certain employees. Each plan expires 10 years after its inception, at which point no further stock options or performance units (commonly referred to as stock awards) may be granted. As of December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, 4,541,522, 5,674,004, and 5,915,585 shares were available for future grants under these plans. Shares forfeited by an employee become available for future grants.
Stock Options Stock options have not been granted since 2003 and all stock options outstanding at December31, 2010 are fully vested. Stock options were granted at prices equal to fair market value on the date of the grant and are exercisable, upon vesting, over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant. Stock options for directors vested immediately, while options for Company employees generally vested over three years (one-third per year). Details of the exercisable stock options are presented in the table below: Aggregate PerShare Weighted-Average Intrinsic Numberof OptionPrice ExercisePrice (dollarsinthousands,exceptpershareamounts) Value Options Range PerShare Exercisable at December31, 2007 $ 13,238 1,684,082 $15.86 - $26.95 $ 19.52 Exercised in 2008 $ 2,385 (287,346 ) $15.88 - $18.81 $ 18.45 Forfeited in 2008 $ 46 (7,398 ) $18.81 $ 18.81 Exercisable at December31, 2008 $ 5,467 1,389,338 $15.86 - $26.95 $ 19.75 Exercised in 2009 $ 4,906 (563,156 ) $15.86 - $17.44 $ 17.40 Exercisable at December31, 2009 $ 6,860 826,182 $16.78 - $26.95 $ 21.35 Exercised in 2010 $ 5,988 (575,236 ) $16.78 - $24.82 $ 19.87 Exercisable at December31, 2010 $ 1,991 250,946 $22.04 - $26.95 $ 24.72 The following table summarizes information about outstanding and exercisable stock options at December31, 2010.

Distribution of the shares will normally be made not less than three years, nor more than six years, from the date of the stock award grant. Stock awards for directors vest immediately. All other stock awards granted under the plans are subject to restrictions as to continuous employment, except in the case of death, permanent disability, or retirement. Approximately 18 percent of the stock awards granted in 2010 and 50 percent of stock awards granted in 2009 are also subject to the degree to which specified total shareholder return conditions are satisfied. In addition, cash payments are made during the vesting period on the outstanding stock awards granted prior to January1, 2010, equal to the dividend on the Companys common stock. Cash payments equal to dividends on awards made on or after January1, 2010, will be distributed at the same time as the shares of common stock to which they relate. The cost of the award is based on the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and is charged to income over the requisite service period.
36 Table of Contents Total compensation expense related to stock incentive plans was $18.4 million in 2010, $19.0 million in 2009, and $18.1 million in 2008.
As of December31, 2010, the unrecorded compensation cost for stock awards was $43.4 million and will be recognized over the remaining vesting period for each grant which ranges between December31, 2011 and December31, 2015. The remaining weighted-average life of all stock awards outstanding as of December31, 2010 was 2.6 years. These awards are considered equity-based awards and are therefore classified as a component of additional paid-in capital.

The weighted-average interest rate of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2010, was 0.4 percent. The maximum outstanding during 2010 was $440.0 million, and the average outstanding during 2010 was $275.5 million. The weighted-average interest rate during 2010 was 0.4 percent.
As of December31, 2010, the Company had available from its banks a $625.0 million revolving credit facility. This credit facility is used principally as back-up for our commercial paper program and expires on April28, 2013. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The revolving credit agreement includes a combined $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries.
On July27, 2009, we issued $400.0 million of bonds due in 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 5.7 percent and $400.0 million of bonds due in 2019 with a fixed interest rate of 6.8 percent. The proceeds of these bonds were used as partial funding of the acquisition of the Alcan Packaging Food Americas business.
The industrial revenue bond has a variable interest rate which is determined weekly by a Remarketing Agent based on similar debt then available. The interest rate at December31, 2010, was 1.9 percent and the weighted-average interest rate during 2009 was 1.8 percent.
Long-term debt maturing in years 2011 through 2015 is $2.9 million, $320.8 million, $164.1 million, $399.7 million, and $0.0 million, respectively. The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants.
Note 13  LEASES The Company has operating leases for manufacturing plants, land, warehouses, machinery and equipment, and administrative offices that expire at various times over the next 32 years. Under most leasing arrangements, the Company pays the property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other expenses related to the leased property. Total rental expense under operating leases was approximately $13.9 million in 2010, $10.6 million in 2009, and $11.5 million in 2008. Capital leases are insignificant.

Approximately $23.3 million of the carryover expires over the period 2014-2023. The balance has no expiration. FASB authoritative guidance requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has, and continues to generate, both net operating losses and deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions for which a valuation allowance is required. The Companys management determined that a valuation allowance of $23.0 million against deferred tax assets primarily associated with the foreign net operating loss carryover was necessary at December31, 2010. This valuation allowance includes $4.8 million at December31, 2010 associated with assets acquired in the acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging.
Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on $263.4 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings.
The Company had total unrecognized tax benefits of $24.0 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009 respectively. The approximate amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective income tax rate if recognized in any future periods was $16.8 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, in millions, is as follows: 2010 2009 Balance at beginning of year $ 11.6 $ 11.9 Additions based on tax positions related to the   current year 1.3 1.0 Additions for tax positions of prior years 13.0 5.5 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (0.7 ) (0.5 ) Reductions due to a lapse of the statute of   limitations (0.8 ) (0.8 ) Settlements (0.4 ) (5.5 ) Balance at end of year $ 24.0 $ 11.6 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of income tax expense. The Company had approximately $7.8 million and $1.0 million accrued for interest and penalties, net of tax benefits, at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
As a result of the acquisition of the Food Americas operations of Alcan Packaging, the Company recorded $7.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $6.7 million of interest and penalties as of December31, 2010 related to pre-acquisition tax positions of prior years. A corresponding asset related to the indemnity provisions has also been recorded for these amounts.
During the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that a reduction of gross unrecognized tax benefits will occur in a range of $0.0 to $3.0 million as a result of the resolution of positions taken on previously filed returns.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax as well as income tax in multiple international jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited for tax years 2008 and 2009. The U.S. federal income tax returns prior to 2008 have been audited and completely settled. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2005 in the significant jurisdictions in which it operates.

On January4, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining 10 percent noncontrolling interest in Insit Embalagens Ltda. for $2.3 million. In accordance with current accounting guidance, the differences between the total consideration amounts paid and the noncontrolling interest adjustments were recorded as adjustments to capital in excess of par value.

Participating securities under this guidance include a portion of our unvested employee stock awards, which receive nonforfeitable cash payments equal to the dividend on the Companys common stock. The calculation of earnings per share for common stock shown below excludes the income attributable to the participating securities from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those awards from the denominator.

Note 18  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including environmental related litigation. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, except as discussed below, that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Environmental Matters The Company is a potentially responsible party (PRP) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws in proceedings associated with seventeen sites around the United States. These proceedings were instituted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies at various times beginning in 1983. Superfund and similar state laws create liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances in the environment. Under these statutes, joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators, site owners and operators, and others regardless of fault. Although these regulations could require the Company to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment at various sites, perform remediation work at such sites, orpay damages for loss of use and non-use values, we expect the Companys liability in these proceedings to be limited to monetary damages. The Company expects its future liability relative to these sites to be insignificant, individually and in the aggregate. The Company has reserved an amount that it believes to be adequate to cover its exposure.
So Paulo Tax Dispute Dixie Toga S.A., acquired by the Company on January5, 2005, is involved in a tax dispute with the City of So Paulo, Brazil. The City imposes a tax on the rendering of printing services. The City has assessed this city services tax on the production and sale of printed labels and packaging products. Dixie Toga, along with a number of other packaging companies, disagree and contend that the city services tax is not applicable to its products and that the products are subject only to the state value added tax (VAT). Under Brazilian law, state VAT and city services tax are mutually exclusive and the same transaction can be subject to only one of those taxes. Based on a ruling from the State of So Paulo, advice from legal counsel, and long standing business practice, Dixie Toga appealed the city services tax and instead continued to collect and pay only the state VAT.
The City of So Paulo disagreed and assessed Dixie Toga the city services tax for the years 1991-1995. The assessments for those years are estimated to be approximately $65.8 million at the date the Company acquired Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2010 exchange rate. Dixie Toga challenged the assessments and ultimately litigated the issue in two annulment actions filed on November24, 1998 and August16, 1999 in the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo. A decision by the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo in 2002 cancelled all of the assessments for the years 1991-1995. The City of So Paulo, the State of So Paulo, and Dixie Toga had each appealed parts of the lower court decision. On February8, 2010, the So Paulo Court of Justice issued a Decision in favor of Dixie Toga. This Decision has been appealed by the City of So Paulo. In the event of a successful appeal by the City and an adverse resolution, the estimated amount for these years could be substantially increased for additional interest, monetary adjustments and costs from the date of acquisition.
The City has also asserted the applicability of the city services tax for the subsequent years 1996-2001 and has issued assessments for those years for Dixie Toga and for Itap Bemis Ltda., a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The assessments for those years were upheld at the administrative level and are being challenged by the companies. The assessments at the date of acquisition for these years for tax and penalties (exclusive of interest and monetary adjustments) are estimated to be approximately $9.9 million for Itap Bemis and $32.0 million for Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2010 exchange rate. In the event of an adverse resolution, the estimated amounts for these years could be increased by $47.4 million for Itap Bemis and $137.2 million for Dixie Toga for interest, monetary adjustments and costs.
The 1996-2001 assessments for Dixie Toga are currently being challenged in the courts. In pursuing its challenge through the courts, taxpayers are generally required, in accordance with court procedures, to pledge assets as security for its lawsuits. Under certain circumstances, taxpayers may avoid the requirement to pledge assets. Dixie Toga has secured a court injunction that avoids the current requirement to pledge assets as security for its lawsuit related to the 1996-2001 assessments.
The City has also asserted the applicability of the city services tax for the subsequent years 2004-2009. The assessments issued by the City for these years have been received and are being challenged by the Company at the administrative level. The assessments for tax, penalties, and interest are estimated to be approximately $32.6 million, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2010 exchange rate.
The Company strongly disagrees with the Citys position and intends to vigorously challenge any assessments by the City of So Paulo. The Company is unable at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of the controversy and as such has not recorded any liability related to this matter. An adverse resolution could be material to the consolidated results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved.
Brazil Investigation On September18, 2007, the Secretariat of Economic Law (SDE), a governmental agency in Brazil, initiated an investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the Brazilian flexible packaging industry against a number of Brazilian companies including a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The investigation relates to periods prior to the Companys acquisition of control of Dixie Toga and its 41 Table of Contents subsidiaries. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the Company is unable at the present time to predict the outcome of this matter.
Other The Company is currently not otherwise subject to any pending litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of the Company.
Note 19  SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS The Companys business activities are organized around and aggregated into its two principal business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure, with no significant differences in accounting policies applied. Minor intersegment sales are generally priced to reflect nominal markups. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based primarily on operating profit, which is defined as profit before general corporate expense, interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests. While there are similarities in selected technology and manufacturing processes utilized between the Companys business segments, notable differences exist in products, application and distribution of products, and customer base.
Products produced within the Flexible Packaging business segment service packaging applications for markets such as food, medical devices, personal care, agribusiness, chemicals, pet food, and tissue. Products produced within the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment include film, paper, and metalized plastic film printing stocks used for primary package labeling, promotional decoration, bar code inventory control labels, and laser printing for administrative office and promotional applications. This segment also includes micro-thin film adhesives used in delicate electronic parts assembly and graphic films for decorative signage.

ITEM 9A  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Managements Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Companys management, under the direction, supervision, and involvement of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)) of the Company. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures in place at the Company are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commissions rulesand forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Bemis Company,Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f).
