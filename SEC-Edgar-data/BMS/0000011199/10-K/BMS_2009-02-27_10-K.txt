Curler, Chief Executive Officer of the   Company, and Gene C. Wulf, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, pursuant   to Section 1350, dated March 8, 2005 2 PART I - ITEMS 1, 2, 3, and 4 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS Bemis Company, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the Registrant or Company), continues a business formed in 1858. The Registrant was incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company with the name changed to Bemis Company, Inc. in 1965. The Registrant is a principal manufacturer of flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials selling to customers throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe with a growing presence in Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico. In 2004, approximately 80 percent of the Registrants sales were derived from the Flexible Packaging segment and approximately 20 percent were derived from the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment.
The Registrants products are sold to customers primarily in the food industry. Other customers include companies in the following types of businesses: chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care products, batteries, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. Further information about the Registrants operations in its business segments is available at Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.
As of December 31, 2004, the Registrant had approximately 11,900 employees, about 8,300 of whom were classified as production employees. Many of the North American production employees are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving four different international unions and one independent union and 19 individual contracts with terms ranging from one to six years. During 2004, six contracts covering approximately 2,000 employees at six different locations in the United States were successfully negotiated. During 2005, three domestic and one Canadian labor agreements covering approximately 600 employees are scheduled to expire. Many of the non-North American production employees as well as some of the non-North American salaried workforce are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving six different unions with terms ranging from one to two years.
Working capital elements fluctuate throughout the year in relation to the level of customer volume and other marketplace conditions. Customer and vendor payment terms are split approximately equally between net 30 days and discountable terms. Discounts are generally one percent for payment within ten days. Inventory levels reflect a reasonable balance between raw material pricing and availability, and the Registrants commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which the Registrant operates as most orders placed with the Registrant are for delivery within 90 days or less. The business of each of the segments is not seasonal to any significant extent.
The Registrant is the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of its products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. The Registrant also has a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign countries. The Registrants patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrants results as a whole or those of either of its segments.
The Registrants business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure. A summary of the Registrants business activities reported by its two business segments follows.
Flexible Packaging Segment The flexible packing segment manufactures a broad range of consumer and industrial packaging. Multilayer flexible polymer film structures and barrier laminates are sold for food, medical, and personal care products as well as non-food applications utilizing controlled or modified atmosphere packaging or unique open or close features. Monolayer and coextruded films are also produced for applications with fewer barrier requirements. Additional products include blown and cast stretchfilm products, carton sealing tapes and application equipment, custom thermoformed plastic packaging, multiwall and single-ply paper bags, printed paper roll stock, and bag closing materials. Markets for our products include processed and fresh meat, liquids, frozen foods, cereals, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, pet food, bakery, seed, lawn and garden, tissue, fresh produce, personal care and hygiene, disposable diapers, printed shrink overwrap for the food and beverage industry, agribusiness, minerals, and medical device packaging.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Segment The pressure sensitive materials segment manufactures pressure sensitive materials that are sold into label markets, graphic markets, and technical markets.
Products for label markets include narrow-web rolls of pressure sensitive paper, film, and metalized film printing stocks used in high-speed printing and die-cutting of primary package labeling, secondary or promotional decoration, and for high-speed, high-volume data processing (EDP) stocks, bar code labels, and numerous laser printing applications. Primary markets include food packaging, personal care product packaging, inventory control labeling, shipping labels, postage stamps, and laser/ink jet printed labels.
Products for graphic markets include pressure sensitive papers and films used for decorative signage through computer-aided plotters, digital and screen printers, and photographic overlaminate and mounting materials including optically clear films with built-in UV inhibitors. Offset printers, sign makers, and photo labs use these products on short-run and/or digital printing technology to create labels, signs, or vehicle graphics. Primary markets are indoor and outdoor signage, photograph and digital print overlaminates, and vehicle graphics.
Products for technical markets are pressure sensitive materials that are technically engineered for performance in varied industrial applications. They include micro-thin film adhesives used in delicate electronic parts assembly and pressure sensitives 3 utilizing foam and tape based stocks to perform fastening and mounting functions. Tapes sold to medical markets feature medical-grade adhesives suitable for direct skin contact. Primary markets are batteries, electronics, automotive, construction, medical, and pharmaceuticals.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition While the Registrants sales are made through a variety of distribution methods, more than 90 percent of each segments sales are made by the Registrants direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico to provide prompt and economical service to more than 30,000 customers. The Registrants technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, and a customer service organization.
No single customer accounts for ten percent or more of the Registrants total sales. Furthermore, the loss of one or a few major customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrants operating results. Nevertheless, business arrangements with large customers require a large portion of the manufacturing capacity at a few individual manufacturing sites. Any change in the business arrangement would typically occur over a period of time, which would allow for an orderly transition for both the Registrants manufacturing site and the customer.
The major markets in which the Registrant sells its products are highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms. Major competitors in the Flexible Packaging segment include Amcor Limited, Exopack Company, Hood Packaging Corporation, Intertape Polymer Group Inc., Alcan Packaging, Pliant Corporation, Printpack, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Sonoco Products Company, Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, and Wihuri OY. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment major competitors include Avery Dennison Corporation, Acucote, Inc., Green Bay Packaging Inc., 3M, Ricoh Company, Ltd., Ritrama Inc., Flexcon Co., Inc., Spinnaker Industries, Inc., Technicote Inc., UPM-Kymmene Corporation, and Wausau Coated Products Inc.
The Registrant considers itself to be a significant factor in the market niches it serves; however, due to the diversity of the Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials segments, the Registrants precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. Advertising is limited primarily to business and trade publications emphasizing the Registrants product features and related technical capabilities and the individual problem-solving approach to customer problems.
Raw Materials Plastic resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, and chemicals constitute the basic major raw materials. These are purchased from a variety of industry sources and the Registrant is not dependent on any one supplier for its raw materials. While temporary shortages of raw materials may occur occasionally, these items are currently readily available.
Research and Development Expense Research and development expenditures were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Flexible Packaging $ 16,923,000 $ 17,060,000 $ 14,509,000 Pressure Sensitive Materials 4,215,000 4,394,000 2,937,000 Total $ 21,138,000 $ 21,454,000 $ 17,446,000 The increase in 2003 reflects additional effort related to new product development.
Environmental Control Compliance with federal, state, and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating discharges of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Registrant and its subsidiaries.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES Properties utilized by the Registrant at December 31, 2004, were as follows: Flexible Packaging Segment This segment has 43 manufacturing plants located in 14 states and eight non-USA countries, of which 36 are owned directly by the Registrant or its subsidiaries, six are leased from outside parties, and one is leased from the Registrants Mexican joint venture partner on a month-to-month basis. Initial lease terms generally provide for minimum terms of two to 25 years and have one or more renewal options. The initial terms of leases in effect at December 31, 2004, expire between 2005 and 2010. In addition a flexible packaging operating location leased adjacent vacant land in 1999 for an initial lease term of 42 years.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Segment This segment has eight manufacturing plants located in four states and two non-USA countries, of which seven are owned directly by the Registrant or its subsidiaries and one is leased from an outside party. The initial term, excluding renewal options, of the lease in effect as of December 31, 2004, expires in 2006.
Corporate and General The executive offices of the Registrant, which are leased, are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Registrant considers its plants and other physical properties to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of its business. The manufacturing plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on the type of operation and market conditions.
ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Registrant is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including environmental related litigation. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, except as discussed below, that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect upon the Registrants financial condition or results of operations.
The Indiana Department of Environmental Management has issued a Notice of Violation to the Registrant regarding various permitting and air emissions violations at its Terre Haute, Indiana facility. The Registrant is cooperating with the Indiana agency and is seeking to resolve all open issues raised by the Notice of Violation. Any settlement or other resolution of these matters may include a penalty. While the Registrant cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any such penalty, management believes that it would not have a material adverse effect upon the Registrants financial condition or results of operations.
The Registrant is a potentially responsible party (PRP) in twelve superfund sites around the United States. The Registrant expects its future liability relative to these sites to be insignificant, individually and in the aggregate. The Registrant has reserved an amount that it believes to be adequate to cover its exposure.
5 Dixie Toga S.A., acquired by the Company on January 5, 2005, is involved in a tax dispute with the City of So Paulo. The City has assessed a city services tax on the production and sale of printed labels and packaging products. Dixie Toga, along with a number of other packaging companies disagree and contend that the city services tax is not applicable and that the products are subject only to the state value added tax (VAT). Under Brazilian law, state VAT and city services tax are mutually exclusive and the same transaction can be subject to only one of those taxes. Based on a ruling from the State of So Paulo, advice from legal counsel, and long standing business practice, Dixie Toga did not pay the city services tax but instead continued to collect and pay the state VAT.
The City of So Paulo disagreed and assessed Dixie Toga the city services tax for the years 1991-1995. The assessments for those years are estimated to be approximately $40.0 million at the date the Company acquired Dixie Toga. Dixie Toga challenged the assessments and ultimately litigated the issue. A lower court decision in 2002 cancelled all of the assessments for 1991-1995. The City of So Paulo, the State of So Paulo, and Dixie Toga have each appealed parts of the lower court decision. The City continues to assert the applicability of the city services tax and has issued assessments for the subsequent years 1996-2001. The assessments for those years for tax and penalties (exclusive of interest) are estimated to be approximately $26.0 million.
Dixie Toga strongly disagrees with the Citys position. The Company believes that Dixie Toga has a strong legal position and intends to vigorously challenge any assessments by the City of So Paulo. The Company is unable at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of the controversy. An adverse resolution could be material to the results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved.
The Company first disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April23, 2003, that the Department of Justice expected to initiate a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry and the Company further discussed the investigation and disclosed that it expected to receive a subpoena in its Form 10-Q filed for the quarter ended June30, 2003. In a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August15, 2003, the Company disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the Departments criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry. The Company has responded to the subpoena and will continue to cooperate fully with the requests of the U.S. Department of Justice.
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Morgan Adhesives Company, have been named as defendants intwelve civil lawsuits. Five of theselawsuits purport to represent a nationwide class of labelstock purchasers, and each alleges a conspiracy to fix prices within the self-adhesive labelstock industry. On November5, 2003, the Judicial Panel on MultiDistrict Litigation issued a decision consolidating all of the federal class actions for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, before the Honorable Chief Judge Vanaskie. Judge Vanaskie entered an order which calls for discovery to be taken on the issues relating to class certification and briefing on plaintiffs motion for class certification to be completed inNovember2005. At this time, a discovery cut-off and a trial date have not been set. TheCompanyhas also been named in four lawsuits filed in the California Superior Court in San Francisco. Three of these lawsuits seek to represent a class of all California indirect purchasers of labelstock and each alleged a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. These three lawsuits havebeen consolidated. Thefourth lawsuit seeks torepresent a class ofCalifornia direct purchasers of labelstock and alleges a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. Finally, the Company has been named in one lawsuit in Vermont, seeking to represent a class of allVermont indirect purchasers of labelstock, one lawsuit in Ohio, seeking to represent a class of all Ohio indirect purchasers of labelstock, and one lawsuit in Tennessee, seeking to represent a class of purchasers of labelstock in various jurisdictions, all alleging a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. The Company intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.
In a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 25, 2004, the Company disclosed that representatives from the European Commission had commenced a search of business records and interviews of certain Company personnel at itsself-adhesive labelstockoperation in Soignies, Belgium to investigate possible violations of European competition law in connection with an investigation of potential anticompetitive activities in the European paper and forestry products sector. The Company continues to cooperate fully with the European Commission.
Given the ongoing status of the U.S. Department of Justice investigation, the related class-action civil lawsuits, and the European Commission investigation, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters although the effect could be material to the results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved. The Company is currently not otherwise subject to any pending litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of the Company.

Generally about 65 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices, personal care, and lawn care. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 80 percent of our net sales. The remaining 20 percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets.
Market Conditions During 2004, higher petrochemical feedstock costs significantly increased the price of polymer resins and adhesives, the primary raw materials for our business segments. Our business model has been developed to accommodate such cost increases by adjusting selling prices to reflect increased costs. In addition, we focus on marketing value-added, unique materials and customer service that cannot be easily duplicated by our competition. During the year, we experienced increased customer demand for innovative packaging and pressure sensitive solutions, reflecting a strengthening economy and our customers focus on new product introductions.
Restructuring and Related Charges During the third quarter of 2003, we initiated a restructuring program in which three flexible packaging plants were closed. This program eliminated less efficient capacity and consolidated production of monolayer blown film into fewer, more efficient facilities. While most of the restructuring activities were completed as of December 31, 2003, gains and losses related to the sale of these closed facilities resulted in a net gain of $0.7 million during 2004.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a restructuring program for our pressure sensitive materials business segment to reduce capacity and fixed costs associated with our label materials product line. The majority of the restructuring activities were completed by the second quarter of 2004. Restructuring charges totaled $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $3.1 million in 2004.
Acquisitions Our acquisitions strategy is growth oriented, focused on the identification of businesses that offer unique packaging technologies, access to new markets or product lines, or critical mass. Since the beginning of 2002, we have completed four such acquisitions to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our business segments. These four acquisitions have added about $275 million of net sales, about two-thirds of which is from non-U.S. manufacturing plants. Our non-U.S. plants are focused on serving the flexible packaging needs of the geographic regions in which each plant resides. These acquisitions are more fully discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On May 26, 2004, Bemis and our Mexican joint venture partner completed the purchase of certain flexible packaging assets of Masterpak S.A. de C.V., including a converting facility in Tultitln, Mexico. These assets produce flexible packaging for dry foods, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, confectionery and bakery products. Annual sales related to the assets acquired were approximately $35 million. We own 51 percent of the acquired business, which will focus on supplying the packaging needs of Mexican food and consumer goods markets.
On January 5, 2005, subsequent to year-end 2004, we acquired majority ownership of Dixie Toga S.A., one of the largest packaging companies in South America with annual revenues in excess of $300 million. The acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of Dixie Toga in addition to 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock. The cash purchase price was approximately $250 million. This acquisition significantly increases our exposure to the growing South American packaging market and provides a strong platform from which to introduce our propriety film products to a new region. Since 1998, Bemis and Dixie Toga have operated a joint venture in Brazil, known as Itap Bemis Ltda., and have established a successful working relationship. Dixie Toga has a strong regional management team, a business model similar to Bemis and growing, profitable operations. We expect this acquisition to have a positive impact on our financial results in 2005.
Results of Operations Consolidated Overview For the year ended December 31, 2004, net sales increased 7.6 percent to $2.83 billion, compared to $2.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. Acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2004 accounted for 1.1 percent of the 7.6 percent increase in net sales while currency translation accounted for 2.3 percent. Increased unit sales in both business segments drove a 3.1 percent increase in net sales during the year, while price and mix accounted for the remaining 1.1 percent increase. Demand for innovative packaging for a variety of food categories such as meat and cheese, frozen foods, confectionery products and snack foods led flexible packaging volumes, while technical products drove an increase in pressure sensitive materials. Net sales in 2003 increased 11.2 percent from net sales of $2.37 billion in 2002. Acquisitions accounted for 6.6 percent of the net sales growth, while currency translation accounted for about 3.0 percent. The remaining 1.6 percent sales growth reflects primarily the increased sales volumes in flexible packaging during 2003.
Operating profit increased to $342.2 million in 2004 from $280.1 million in 2003 and $316.4 million in 2002. Operating profit in 2004 reflects a $5.6 million gain on the sale of an in-house rotogravure graphics plant. In addition, restructuring and related charges included in operating profit totaled $2.4 million and $16.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the plant and any restructuring charges, operating profit would have been $339.0 million for 2004, an increase of 14.3 9 percent from $296.7 million for 2003. There were no restructuring charges during 2002. Cost savings in 2004 resulting from the completed restructuring programs were partially offset by increased pension expense. Sales mix improvements resulted in increased operating profit during 2004. During 2003, competitive pricing pressures for flexible packaging products sold into industrial markets and for pressure sensitive label materials, in addition to increases in certain resin costs, contributed to lower margins.
Net income totaled $180.0 million in 2004, $147.1 million in 2003, and $165.5 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 for 2004, including restructuring and related charges of about $0.014 per share. Results for 2004 also reflect a gain of $0.032 per share on the sale of rotogravure plant assets during the fourth quarter of the year. For 2003, diluted earnings per share were $1.37, including restructuring and related charges of about $0.095 per share. Diluted earnings per share for 2002 totaled $1.54.
Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including meat and cheese, confectionery, frozen foods, lawn and garden, personal care, beverages, medical devices, bakery and snack foods. These markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion.
The most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins, which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products. During periods of unusual raw material cost volatility, selling price changes may lag behind changes in our raw material costs. During 2004, resin costs steadily increased, resulting in double-digit percentage increases by year-end. These raw material costs were reflected in increased selling prices during the year. During 2003, polyethylene resin prices increased 30 percent during the first quarter in anticipation of natural gas shortages due to conflict in the Middle East and other international supply concerns. As concerns subsided in April, prices drifted back down, resulting in a volatile pricing period that delayed our ability to adjust selling prices, which negatively impacted 2003 operating margins.
In July 2003, we announced a restructuring effort to reduce fixed costs, take out monolayer film capacity and direct production volume to more efficient facilities. We closed three flexible packaging manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of 2003, recording restructuring and related charges of $13.9 million during 2003. Of this total charge, $7.1 million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and was classified as costs of products sold. The remaining $6.8 million of charges included $5.0 million for employee severance and related costs and $1.8 million of other costs, primarily equipment relocation, all of which have been recorded as other costs (income), net. With the flexible packaging restructuring efforts essentially completed at December 31, 2003, the net restructuring gain of $0.7 million classified as other costs (income), net, in 2004 relates primarily to the sale of closed facilities offset by ongoing costs to maintain these closed facilities.
Our flexible packaging business segment recorded net sales of $2.25 billion in 2004, a 7.1 percent increase from $2.10 billion in 2003. The acquisition of the flexible packaging assets of Masterpak, a Mexican joint venture investment made during the second quarter of 2004, contributed 0.8 percent sales growth. Currency translation accounted for a 1.8 percent increase in sales, primarily reflecting the impact of our exposure to the strengthening Euro. Strong unit sales to markets for meat and cheese, confectionery and snack foods, frozen foods, personal care products, cereal products and unitizing film for products such as bottled water was partially offset by lower unit sales to bakery, pet product and industrial markets. Price and mix increased sales by about 1.1 percent in total, as customers balanced price increases with changes in product mix. Net sales increased 12.3 percent in 2003 from $1.87 billion in 2002. Acquisitions accounted for an increase of 8.4 percent and currency translation accounted for 2.0 percent of the improvement from 2002.
Operating profit increased to $308.3 million in 2004 compared to $263.8 million in 2003 and $289.1 million in 2002. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.7 percent in 2004 compared to 12.6 percent in 2003. Operating profit was 15.5 percent in 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a gain of $5.6 million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Florence, Kentucky that supported internal rotogravure graphics capabilities. Excluding the impact of both the gain on the sale of that facility as well as restructuring charges, operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 13.4 percent in 2004 compared to 13.2 percent in 2003. Savings resulting from the restructuring program were significantly offset by increased pension costs and incentive compensation in 2004. In addition, operating losses from the newly acquired joint venture in Mexico totaled $3.7 million in 2004 where resolution of supplier issues and deferred maintenance activities related to the previous ownership is continuing. Factors that dampened flexible packaging operating profits in 2003 included increased employee pension and other benefit costs and unusual volatility in the price of polyethylene resin during the first half of the year.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, battery, construction and medical industries.
Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions have had a greater negative influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs. During 2004, the increased cost of petrochemical products caused an associated increase in the cost of adhesive materials, in addition to a concern about availability of adhesive from suppliers. In response to these cost increases, we increased selling prices and secured alternative supplies of raw materials in case of shortages. We focused on margin expansion by introducing new product innovations and quality initiatives during the year. In addition, recent restructuring activities resulted in better capacity utilization in label products.
In October of 2003, we announced the restructuring of our label products capacity. We closed two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization in our label products line. Restructuring and related charges of $2.7 million were recorded in 10 2003, of which $2.3 million related to severance and related charges and was recorded as other costs (income), net. The remaining $0.4 million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and related charges and was recorded as an element of costs of products sold. During 2004, restructuring and related charges totaling $3.1 million related primarily to the cost of closing a label products plant in Nevada. Of this total, $1.8 million related to costs and equipment relocation and was recorded as other costs (income), net, with the remaining costs associated with accelerated depreciation charged to costs of products sold.
Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported net sales of $584.8 million in 2004, an increase of 9.5 percent from net sales of $534.1 million in 2003. An acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2003 of a graphic business in Europe increased net sales by 2.6 percent during 2004 and currency translation provided a 4.2 percent increase. About 44 percent of the sales from this business segment are from our manufacturing operations in Belgium, which benefited from the strengthening of the European currencies during 2004. Stronger unit sales of technical products more than offset slightly lower unit sales of label and graphic products compared to 2003. Price and mix provided a combined improvement to net sales during the year of about 1.0 percent. Net sales in 2003 increased 7.0 percent from $498.9 million in 2002, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro during 2003.
Operating profit increased substantially in 2004 to $33.9 million or 5.8 percent of net sales, compared to $16.3 million or 3.1 percent of net sales in 2003, and $27.3 million or 5.5 percent of net sales in 2002. Excluding the impact of restructuring and related charges, operating profit would have been $37.0 million or 6.3 percent of net sales in 2004, and $19.0 million or 3.6 percent of net sales in 2003. Currency translation contributed $2.2 million to operating profit in 2004 and $2.9 million in 2003. Improved profit levels in 2004 reflect improved sales mix and the savings associated with restructuring activities early in the year, partially offset by increased pension expense. During 2003, label product markets were very competitive, as reduced selling prices offset much of the benefits of improving production volume during the year.
Gross Margin Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased to 21.0 percent in 2004 compared to 20.2 percent in 2003. Gross margin was 22.3 percent in 2002. Restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by $1.1 million in 2004 and $7.6 million in 2003. Lower margins in 2004 reflect the impact of higher resin costs in advance of selling price increases and an increased proportion of lower margin non-U.S. sales. We are implementing improvements in Europe and Mexico to increase profitability at those locations. During 2003, unusual volatility in raw material prices for flexible packaging products coupled with pricing pressure in markets for certain commodity-like products caused margins to decline from 2002 levels.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.1 percent for 2004, compared to 9.7 percent for both 2003 and 2002. Total expenses were $285.0 million in 2004, $256.7 million in 2003, and $229.3 million in 2002. Increased expenses for 2004 reflect the larger sales organization associated with our global sales efforts and an increase from 2003 in broad-based incentive compensation and pension expense.
Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased slightly in 2004 to $21.1 million compared to $21.5 million in 2003. Expenses in 2002 totaled $17.4 million. Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness and relevance of our research and developments activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold.
Interest Expense Substantially all of our outstanding debt for each of the three years presented was subject to variable interest rates. During 2004, short-term interest rates increased gradually from about 1.1 percent at December 31, 2003 to about 2.3 percent at December 31, 2004. The impact of this increase in short-term interest rates was partially offset by a $42.6 million decrease in outstanding debt during 2004. Interest expense increased in 2004 to $15.5 million compared to $12.6 million in 2003. During 2002, we recorded interest expense of $15.4 million, reflecting lower interest rates but higher outstanding debt levels. We expect interest expense to increase substantially in 2005 due to increasing short-term interest rates and higher debt levels. On January 5, 2005, we acquired a Brazilian packaging company for which we assumed about $40 million in interest-bearing debt and borrowed approximately $250 million to complete the acquisition.
Other Costs (Income), Net We reported net other income of $20.1 million in 2004, reflecting a $5.6 million gain on the sale of a rotogravure facility during the fourth quarter partially offset by restructuring and related charges of $1.2 million. Equity income from our Brazilian joint venture was $11.7 million in 2004, reflecting improved profitability in addition to an increase in our equity ownership from 33 percent to 45 percent in January 2004. The remainder of other income in 2004 is primarily interest income. During 2003, net other costs of $2.7 million included $8.9 million of restructuring and related charges related to employee severance and the closure of manufacturing facilities. The Brazilian joint venture accounted for $3.2 million of equity income during 2003. Net other income of $1.2 million in 2002 was primarily related to interest income.
Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 38.7 percent in 2004, 38.5 percent in 2003, and 38.0 percent in 2002. The difference between our overall tax rate and the U. S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent in each of those three years principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits.
11 Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Rating At year-end the Company had long-term credit ratings of A from Standard & Poors and A2 from Moodys Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-1 and P-1 for our commercial paper program from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. Our financial position and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest.
On January 5, 2005, we acquired the outstanding voting common stock and 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock of Dixie Toga S.A. for a cash price of approximately $250 million. The acquisition was initially financed with commercial paper. We intend to refinance a portion of our commercial paper during the first half of 2005. In July 2005, $100 million of existing public bonds will mature and we expect to refinance this debt with available commercial paper capacity.
In conjunction with the January 2005 acquisition, the credit rating agencies have reviewed the ratings that they have assigned to our debt. Standard & Poors has confirmed their ratings of A and A-1 for our long-term senior unsecured debt and commercial paper, respectively. On March 11, 2005, Moodys Investor Service reduced our long-term senior unsecured debt credit rating to "Baa1" and reduced our commercial paper rating to "P-2." Sources of Liquidity Cash provided by operations was $271.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $311.1 million in 2003 and $286.7 million in 2002. Cash provided by operations in 2004 and 2003 was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $50 million and $40 million, respectively. While no contributions are required for 2005 or 2006, we continue to monitor the funded status of our U.S. pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity. Increased raw material costs during 2004 resulted in increased levels of working capital, which had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during the second half of the year.
In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs. At year-end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $160 million. In early January 2005 the amount of outstanding commercial paper increased substantially as a direct result of the acquisition of Dixie Toga S.A. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. While not anticipated, if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper, we would draw upon our existing back-up credit facility. In September 2004, we renegotiated our back-up credit facility to extend the term to September of 2009. The previous credit facility included a Revolving Credit Agreement where the Company could borrow up to $334 million through August 2006. Our new credit facility provides $500 million of available financing supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. In addition to funds available under this credit facility, we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately $100 million of Extendable Commercial Notes (ECNs), which are short-term instruments whose maturity can be extended to 390 days from the date of issuance. Previously the Company had a 364-day Credit Agreement under which the Company could borrow up to $250 million. If these new credit facilities and ECNs were no longer available to us, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs.
Long-term Debt Commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004, has been classified as long-term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The related back-up credit agreement expires in 2009. In July 2005, public bonds totaling $100 million will mature. We intend to refinance those bonds with commercial paper.
Uses of Liquidity Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $134.5 million during 2004, compared to $106.5 million in 2003 and $91.0 million in 2002. During 2004, we invested in additional capacity for our European operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and to provide a platform to introduce new proprietary film products. Capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to be in the $185 million to $200 million range. Increased expenditures for 2005 primarily relate to capacity needs in North American operations. After 2005, capital expenditures are expected to return to levels approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses.
Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14.3 percent during the first quarter of 2004 to 16 cents per share from 14 cents per share. This follows increases of 7.7 percent in 2003 and 4.0 percent in 2002. In February 2005, the Board of Directors approved the 22 nd consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 18 cents per share, a 12.5 percent increase.
Share Repurchases We did not make any share repurchases during the three years presented. As of December 31, 2004, management is authorized to purchase up to 4.7 million shares of common stock for the treasury.
12 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of December 31, 2004.
Contractual Payments Due by Period Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt payments (1) $ 572.0 $ 115.7 $ 25.4 $ 422.4 $ 8.5 Capital leases (2) 0.7 0.2 0.4 0.1 0.0 Operating leases (3) 26.0 6.8 7.4 4.4 7.4 Purchase obligations (4) 136.5 132.7 3.7 0.1 0.0 Pension contributions (5) 5.2 5.2 (1) Amount   noted includes estimated interest costs. Long-term and short-term debt   obligations, excluding interest, are included in our Consolidated Balance   Sheets. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit   facility that expires on September 2, 2009. See Note 11 of the Notes to the   Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our debt   and related matters.
(2) Amount   noted includes estimated interest costs. The present value of these   obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance   Sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for   additional information about our capital lease obligations.
(3) We   enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially   all lease agreements have fixed payments terms based on the passage of time.   Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our   future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal   options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. Our   operating lease obligations are described in Note 10 of our Consolidated   Financial Statements.
(4) Purchase   obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw   materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services.
(5) Amount   noted is funding requirements of non-U.S. pension plans. No requirements   exist for future funding.
Interest Rate Swaps Our long-term unsecured notes include $100 million due in July 2005 and $250 million due in August 2008. In September 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with three U.S. banks, which increased our exposure to variable rates. We generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term. These interest rate swap agreements, which expire in 2005 and 2008, reduced the interest cost of the $350 million of long-term debt from about 6.6 percent to about 3.2 percent in 2004. Since these variable rates are based upon six-month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), calculated in arrears, at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $518.4 million of total debt outstanding would increase by $5.2 million.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the fair value of these swaps, which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding, be recorded as an asset or liability of the Company. The fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of $14.9 million at December 31, 2004, and an asset of $22.6 million at December 31, 2003. For each period, an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long-term notes outstanding. These fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes, nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated.
Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates, establish rates for future issuance of public bonds, and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates.
Interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short-term interest rates. As such, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $518.4 million of total debt outstanding would increase by $5.2 million.
Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, principally for transactions in non-Euro zone countries. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $3.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months and relate primarily to major Western European currencies. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and 13 recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability.
The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on 2004 net sales was an increase of $59.6 million or 2.3 percent from 2003. Operating profit improved by approximately $4.8 million as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation during 2004.
Long-term Compensation While our practice of awarding long-term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period, we have also granted some stock options in the past. Beginning in 2004, we discontinued the awarding of stock options. Stock options granted prior to 2004 were granted at prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and exercisable, upon vesting, over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant. Stock options for Directors vested immediately, while options for Company employees become vested over three years (one-third per year). Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Options, we disclose the impact on net income and earnings per share of stock options outstanding, as if compensation expense were measured using a fair value method, in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements. Beginning July 1, 2005, accounting rules will require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options. If we followed this fair value method during 2004, diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by one cent for the year ended 2004, two cents for the year ended 2003, and one cent for the year ended 2002. We expect the impact to diluted earnings per share for 2005 to be insignificant.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and  The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill.
Accounting for annual pension costs We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States. As permitted by SFAS No. 87, we use a calculated value of plan assets (which is further described below). SFAS No. 87 requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plans assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income or expense be amortized over future periods.
Pension expense recorded in 2004 was $25.2 million, compared to pension expense of $9.6 million in 2003 and pension income of $3.2 million in 2002. We expect 2005 pension expense to be comparable to the levels of 2004.
One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87 is the expected return on plan assets. As of January 1, 2005, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, we have assumed that the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.75 percent. This represents a decrease from the 9.0 percent level assumed for 2004 and 9.5 percent level assumed for 2003.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. Using historical long-term investment periods of 10, 15 and 20 years, our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of 10.9 percent, 10.1 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively, each in excess of our assumed rates.
In future years, we expect that returns will be lower than the historical returns discussed above due to a generally lower inflation and interest rate environment. Considering this, we selected an 8.75 percent long-term rate of return on assets assumption as of January 1, 2005. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 80 percent equity securities and 20 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long-term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable.
This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense.
14 At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2004, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 5.75 percent, a decrease of one half of one percent from the 6.25 percent rate used at December 31, 2003.
Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 5.75 percent for the discount rate and 8.75 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2005 to be in a range of $25 million to $28 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2005 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on assets.
Total increase (decrease) Total increase (decrease) to pension expense to pension expense ($in millions) from current assumptions from current assumptions Discount rate Rate of Return on Plan Assets 5.00 percent $ 6.0 8.00 percent $ 2.9 5.25 percent 4.0 8.25 percent 1.9 5.50 percent 2.0 8.50 percent 1.0 5.75   percentCurrent Assumption 0.0 8.75 percent  Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent (1.9 ) 9.00 percent (1.0 ) 6.25 percent (3.8 ) 9.25 percent (1.9 ) 6.50 percent (5.7 ) 9.50 percent (2.9 ) The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the minimum pension liability adjustment on equity, net of tax, resulting from changes in the assumed discount rate.
Total (increase) decrease in equity from current assumptions Discount rate 5.00 percent $ 55.2 5.25 percent (1) 46.9 5.50 percent 2.7 5.75 percent  Current Assumption 0.0 6.00 percent (2.6 ) 6.25 percent (5.2 ) 6.50 percent (7.6 ) (1) If   the discount rate had been reduced to 5.25 percent at December 31, 2004, the   accumulated benefit obligation for the largest of the defined benefit pension   plans would have exceeded the related plan assets. This would then have   required a minimum pension liability adjustment with a corresponding   reduction to equity, net of tax, of about $46.9 million. A further decrease   in the discount rate to 5.00 percent would only result in an additional   equity adjustment of $8.3 million.
Intangible assets and goodwill The purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and goodwill. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $442.2 million as of December 31, 2004.
Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 20 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition and amounts of future cash flows.
New Accounting Pronouncements On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which will significantly change accounting practice with respect to employee stock options. FAS 123R requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity-based service awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to 15 provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. A public entity will initially measure the cost of liability-based service awards based on its current fair value; the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period. The Company expects that the impact of adopting this standard will be insignificant to the Companys results of operation.
On November 24, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The standard adopts the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. Additionally, the Board made the decision to clarify the meaning of the term normal capacity. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has not determined the impact of this SFAS No. 151 to its inventory accounting results which may result upon adoption of this statement on January 1, 2006.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) No. FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This FSP provides guidance on how an enterprise should account for the deduction for qualified production activities provided by the American Jobs Act of 2004. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new deduction, the benefit of which will be considered in our future tax provisions.
In December 2004, the FASB also issued FSP No. FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This FSP allows additional time for companies to determine how the new law affects a companys accounting for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings. The new law provides for a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated and which meet certain requirements. We are currently evaluating whether any of the earnings of our non-U.S. operations will be repatriated in accordance with the terms of this law.
Subsequent Events On January 5, 2005, Bemis announced that it had acquired majority ownership of Dixie Toga S.A., one of the largest packaging companies in South America and Bemis Brazil-based partner in the Itap Bemis Ltda. joint venture. In this transaction, we acquired the outstanding voting common stock and 43 percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock of Dixie Toga for a total cash price of approximately $250 million. The purchase price was initially financed with commercial paper and, combined with a small amount of debt assumed in the acquisition, our debt to total capitalization ratio increased on the acquisition date to approximately 36 percent. Preferred stock of Dixie Toga is publicly traded on the Brazilian Bovespa Stock Exchange. Dixie Toga recorded annual revenues during 2004 in excess of $300 million. With this acquisition, the results of operations of Dixie Toga will include our Brazilian joint venture, Itap Bemis Ltda., and will be consolidated in our financial statements beginning in January of 2005. We expect this acquisition to have a positive impact on our financial results in 2005.
Forward-looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward-looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward-looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; operating results and cash flows from acquisitions may differ from what we anticipate; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs, availability, and terms, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; changes in governmental regulation, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings, including the U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry, any related proceedings or civil lawsuits, and the investigation by European Anticompetitive Authorities into the competitive practices in the Paper and Forestry Products industries; unexpected outcomes in our current and future tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statement.
16 ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Managements Responsibility Statement The management of Bemis Company, Inc., is responsible for the integrity, objectivity, and accuracy of the financial statements of the Company. The financial statements are prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and using managements best estimates and judgments, where appropriate. The financial information presented throughout the Annual Report is consistent with that in the financial statements.
The management of Bemis Company, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f). Under the direction, supervision, and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Registrants management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-Framework). Based on the results of this evaluation management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO-Framework criteria. Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains managements favorable assessment of internal controls over financial reporting based on their review and evaluation. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets quarterly with management, the internal audit manager, and independent accountants to review the work of each and to satisfy itself that the respective parties are properly discharging their responsibilities. Both PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the internal audit manager have had and continue to have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, without the presence of Company management.
Jeffrey H. Curler Gene C. Wulf Stanley A.   Jaffy President and Vice   President, Chief Financial Vice   President and Chief Executive Officer Officer and   Treasurer Controller 17 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Bemis Company, Inc.: We have completed an integrated audit of Bemis Company, Inc.s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bemis Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

22 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1  BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of the business: Bemis Company, Inc., a Missouri corporation, was founded in 1858 and incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company. In 1965 the name was changed to Bemis Company, Inc. (the Company). Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Company employs approximately 11,900 individuals and has 51 manufacturing facilities in nine countries around the world. The Company is a manufacturer of flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials selling to customers throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe, with a growing presence in Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico.
The Companys business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging, which accounted for approximately 80 percent of 2004 net sales, and Pressure Sensitive Materials, which accounted for the remaining net sales. The Companys flexible packaging business has a strong technical base in polymer chemistry, film extrusion, coating, laminating, printing, and converting. The Companys pressure sensitive materials business specializes in adhesive technologies. The primary markets for the Companys products are in the food industry, which accounted for approximately 65 percent of 2004 net sales. The Companys flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets include chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care products, batteries, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality, and service.
Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The single joint venture in which the Company participates is accounted for by the equity method of accounting with earnings ($11,698,000, $3,156,000, and $5,000 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively) included in other costs (income), net, on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and the investment included with deferred charges and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Estimates and assumptions required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Translation of foreign currencies: The Company considers the local currency to be the reporting currency for all foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. All revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. Translation gains or losses are recorded in the foreign currency translation component in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $1,002,000, $1,147,000, and $(165,000) in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, are included as a component of other costs (income), net.
Revenue recognition: Sales and related costs of sales are recognized upon shipment of products or when all of the conditions of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 are fulfilled. There are no significant post delivery obligations. All costs associated with revenue, including customer rebates and discounts, are recognized at the time of sale. Customer rebates are accrued in accordance with EITF No. 01-9 Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer and recorded as a reduction to sales. In December 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of EITF No. 02-16 Accounting by a Customer for Certain Consideration Received From a Vendor, with no material impact to the financial statements. Shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of costs of sales while amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as a component of sales. The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs when specific issues are identified and the amounts are determinable.
Environmental cost: The Company is involved in a number of environmental related disputes and claims. The Company accrues for environmental costs when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, reserves were $836,000 and $721,000, respectively. Adjustments to the reserve accounts and costs which were directly expensed for environmental remediation matters resulted in charges to the income statements for 2004, 2003, and 2002 of $174,000, $265,000, and $327,000, net of third party reimbursements totaling $79,000, $91,000, and $101,000, for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
Research and development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.
Taxes on undistributed earnings: No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiary companies which the Company controls but does not include in the consolidated federal income tax return as it is managements practice and intent to indefinitely reinvest the earnings.
23 Earnings per share: Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year and dilutive shares relating to stock options, restricted stock, and stock incentive plans. The following table presents information necessary to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share: (in thousands, except per share   amounts) 2004 2003 2002 Weighted average common shares outstanding    basic 106,892 106,180 105,871 Dilutive shares 1,050 1,553 1,622 Weighted average common shares outstanding    diluted 107,942 107,733 107,493 Net income   for basic and diluted earnings per share computation $ 179,967 $ 147,145 $ 165,515 Earnings per common share  basic $ 1.68 $ 1.39 $ 1.56 Earnings per common share  diluted $ 1.67 $ 1.37 $ 1.54 Certain options outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002 (409,070 and 2,494 shares) were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not have had a dilutive effect.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation: In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. An amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 only and has elected to continue with its current practice of applying the recognition and measurement principles of APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
The intrinsic value method is used to account for stock-based compensation plans. If compensation expense had been determined based on the fair value-based method and charged against income over the vesting periods, net income and income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: (dollars in thousands, except   per share amounts) 2004 2003 2002 Net income - as reported $ 179,967 $ 147,145 $ 165,515 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included   in net income, net of related tax effects 7,297 6,563 9,428 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation   expense under fair value-based method, net of related tax effects (7,790 ) (8,035 ) (10,537 ) Net income - pro forma $ 179,474 $ 145,673 $ 164,406 Basic earnings per share - as reported $ 1.68 $ 1.39 $ 1.56 Basic earnings per share - pro forma $ 1.68 $ 1.37 $ 1.55 Diluted earnings per share - as reported $ 1.67 $ 1.37 $ 1.54 Diluted earnings per share - pro forma $ 1.66 $ 1.35 $ 1.53 Compensation expense for pro forma purposes is reflected over the vesting period. Note 9 contains the significant assumptions used in determining the underlying fair value of options and Note 3 addresses accounting changes, effective in 2005, surrounding stock-based compensation.
Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid temporary investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates market value.
Accounts Receivable: Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The following factors are considered when determining the collectibility of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experience, current economic industry trends, and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on managements assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,935,000 and $14,949,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Inventory valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market. Inventories are summarized at December 31, as follows: (in thousands) 2004 2003 Raw materials and supplies $ 136,379 $ 101,966 Work in process and finished goods 264,312 216,303 Total inventories, gross 400,691 318,269 Less inventory write-downs (13,277 ) (13,087 ) Total inventories, net $ 387,414 $ 305,182 24 Property and equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Plant and equipment are depreciated for financial reporting purposes principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets as follows: land improvements, 15-30 years; buildings, 15-45 years; leasehold and building improvements, 8-20 years; and machinery and equipment, 3-16 years. For tax purposes, the Company generally uses accelerated methods of depreciation. The tax effect of the difference between book and tax depreciation has been provided as deferred income taxes. Depreciation expense was $126,082,000, $122,295,000, and $114,170,000 for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. On sale or retirement, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reflected in income. Interest costs, which are capitalized during the construction of major capital projects, totaled $178,000 in 2004, $135,000 in 2003, and $55,000 in 2002.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value.
The Company capitalizes direct costs of materials and services used in the development and purchase of internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three to seven years and are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within property and equipment.
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the reporting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and, as required, has applied its requirements to acquisitions made after June 30, 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or whenever there is an impairment indicator, using a fair-value based approach.
Intangible assets: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are being amortized against income using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, with periods ranging up to 20 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever there is an impairment indicator. Intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations to net book value.
Financial Instruments: The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in shareholders equity through other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized. Gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized through earnings in the current period. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 was not material to the Company. Note 15 contains expanded details relating to specific derivative instruments included on the Companys balance sheet, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap arrangements.
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows as of December 31: (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Foreign currency translation $ 57,426 $ 11,493 $ (47,744 ) Minimum pension liability, net of deferred   tax benefit of $16,258, $14,825, and $30,493 (25,752 ) (23,681 ) (49,753 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income   (loss) $ 31,674 $ (12,188 ) $ (97,497 ) Treasury Stock: Repurchased common stock is stated at cost and is presented as a separate reduction of shareholders equity. At December 31, 2004, 4.7 million common shares can be repurchased, at managements discretion, under authority granted by the Companys Board of Directors in 2000.
Preferred Stock Purchase Rights: On July 29, 1999, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan by declaring a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock. Under certain circumstances, a right may be exercised to purchase one four-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Preferred Stock for $60, subject to adjustment. The rights become exercisable if, subject to certain exceptions, a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock or announces an offer which would result in such person acquiring beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock. If a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions, each right will entitle its holder to buy from the Company, common stock of the Company having a market value of twice the exercise price of the right. The rights expire August 23, 2009, and may be redeemed by the Company for $.001 per right at any time before a person becomes a beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock. The Companys Board of Directors has designated 600,000 shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock with a par value of $1 per share that relate to the Shareholder Rights Plan. At December 31, 2004, none of these shares were issued or outstanding.
25 Note 2  SUBSEQUENT EVENT  ACQUISITION OF DIXIE TOGA S.A.
On January 5, 2005, the Company acquired majority ownership of Dixie Toga S.A., headquartered in So Paulo, Brazil. Dixie Toga recorded annual net sales in excess of $300 million in 2004. In this transaction, the Company acquired the outstanding voting common stock and 43 percent of the outstanding, non-voting preferred stock of Dixie Toga for a total cash price of approximately $250 million, which was financed with commercial paper.
The Company and Dixie Toga have operated a flexible packaging joint venture in Brazil since 1998. This venture, known as Itap Bemis Ltda., represents about one-third of Dixie Togas annual net sales. The Company owns 45 percent of the joint venture and has accounted for it on an equity basis for the year 2004 and earlier. Dixie Toga is a leading packaging company in South America, specializing in flexible packaging, thermoformed and injection molded containers, laminated plastic tubes, printed labels, and printed folding cartons. Dixie Toga employs over 3,000 people in South America and operates nine manufacturing plants in Brazil and two in Argentina. The remaining non-voting preferred shares not acquired are traded publicly on the Brazilian Bovespa Exchange.
Note 3  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which will significantly change accounting practice with respect to employee stock options. FAS 123R requires that the Company measure the cost of equity-based service awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. The Company will initially measure the cost of liability-based service awards based on its current fair value; the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period. The Company expects that the impact of adopting this standard will be insignificant to the Companys results of operation.
On November 24, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The standard adopts the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. Additionally, the Board made the decision to clarify the meaning of the term normal capacity. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has not determined the impact of this SFAS No. 151 to its inventory accounting results which may result upon adoption of this statement on January 1, 2006.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) No. FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This FSP provides guidance on how an enterprise should account for the deduction for qualified production activities provided by the American Jobs Act of 2004. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new deduction, the benefit of which will be considered in our future tax provisions.
In December 2004, the FASB also issued FSP No. FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This FSP allows additional time for companies to determine how the new law affects a companys accounting for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings. The new law provides for a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated and which meet certain requirements. We are currently evaluating whether any of the earnings of our non-U.S. operations will be repatriated in accordance with the terms of this law.
Note 4  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment follow: Flexible Packaging Pressure Sensitive (in thousands) Segment Materials Segment Total Reported balance at December 31, 2002 $ 397,301 $ 50,708 $ 448,009 Currency translation adjustment 5,377 5,377 Other adjustments (2,793 ) (2,793 ) Reported balance at December 31, 2003 399,885 50,708 450,593 Contribution of previously consolidated   subsidiary to equity investment in Brazilian joint venture (7,679 ) (7,679 ) Business acquisition 1,932 1,932 Goodwill allocated to business dispositions (4,316 ) (4,316 ) Currency translation adjustment 1,651 1,651 Reported balance at December 31, 2004 $ 391,473 $ 50,708 $ 442,181 26 The components of amortized intangible assets follow: December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 (in thousands) Gross Carrying Accumulated Gross Carrying Accumulated Intangible Assets Amount Amortization Amount Amortization Contract based $ 15,323 $ (5,681 ) $ 15,323 $ (4,531 ) Technology based 52,218 (10,845 ) 52,644 (8,102 ) Marketing related 8,989 (2,189 ) 8,729 (1,244 ) Customer based 10,547 (2,966 ) 10,139 (1,809 ) Reported balance $ 87,077 $ (21,681 ) $ 86,835 $ (15,686 ) Amortization expense for intangible assets during 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $5.8 million, $5.9 million, and $5.1 million, respectively. Estimated amortization expense is $5.8 million for 2005 and for 2006, $5.7 million for 2007, and $5.6 million for 2008 and for 2009. The Company completed its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2004 with no indications of impairment of goodwill found.
Note 5  BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS On May 25, 2004, the Company and its Mexican partner, Corporacion JMA, S.A. de C.V., acquired the Tultitlan, Mexico plant operation of Masterpak, S.A. de C.V. for $30.7 million. Recently reported annual sales related to the assets purchased were approximately $35.0 million. While the Companys ownership share is 51 percent, the Company financed its Mexican partners portion of the purchase price and as such 100 percent of this entity continues to be effectively consolidated by the Company at December 31, 2004. The total purchase price has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, reflecting the provisions of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142, and includes: working capital, $9.9 million; property, $19.5 million; intangible assets, deferred charges, and goodwill $2.0 million; and long-term liabilities, $0.7 million. Results of operations from the date of acquisition are included in these financial statements.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company contributed its 90 percent ownership interest in Curwood Itap Ltda., its shrink bags business in Brazil, to its Brazilian flexible packaging joint venture, Itap Bemis Ltda. Assets and liabilities of Curwood Itap Ltda. (consolidated at December 31, 2003) contributed included: working capital, $14.7 million, including cash of $7.1 million; property, $3.7 million; intangible assets and deferred charges, $8.4 million; and minority interest, $2.7 million. In exchange for this contribution, the Companys ownership interest in Itap Bemis Ltda. increased from 33 percent to 45 percent. In addition, the Company recorded a $6.2 million charge related to previously deferred cumulative translation losses which substantially offset the gain on the divesture of assets described above. The net increase in the investment in Itap Bemis Ltda. was $30.5 million, including a net gain of $0.2 million on this transaction. During 2004, the joint venture has been accounted for on the equity method and equity earnings have been included as a component of other costs (income), net. In connection with the business acquisition described in Note 2, this joint venture, Itap Bemis Ltda., is now majority owned and controlled (effective January 5, 2005) and will be consolidated beginning in 2005.
Effective on November 5, 2003, the Company purchased the pressure sensitive materials business of Multi-Fix N.V. for a cash price of $11.3 million. The acquired business, which recorded annual sales in 2002 of approximately $15.0 million (unaudited), offers additional coating capacity for the Companys existing European graphics product line. The acquisition included a manufacturing plant in Genk, Belgium. The total cash purchase price has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, reflecting the provisions of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142, and includes the allocations as follows: $16.1 million to tangible assets and $4.8 million to liabilities assumed. Results of operations from the date of acquisition are included in these financial statements.
Effective on October 1, 2002, the Company purchased the Walki Films business of UPM-Kymmene for a cash price of $68.5 million, subsequently increased by a working capital adjustment of $0.7 million. The acquired business, which recorded annual sales in 2001 of approximately $120.0 million (unaudited), is the largest component of Bemis European packaging operations and specializes in high barrier vacuum and modified atmosphere packaging used primarily for packaging meat, cheese, and other fresh foods. The acquisition included manufacturing plants in Valkeakoski, Finland, and Epernon, France. The net cash purchase price has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting reflecting the provisions of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 and includes the allocations as follows: $77.9 million to tangible assets, $7.5 million to intangible assets, $21.3 million to liabilities assumed, $4.1 million to tax deductible goodwill, and $1.0 million to non-deductible goodwill. Intangible assets acquired had a weighted-average useful life of approximately 10 years and include $0.2 million for contract-based intangibles with a useful life of 1 year, $3.0 million for marketing related intangibles with a useful life of 10 years, and $4.3 million for customer-based intangibles with a useful life of 10 years. Results of operations from the date of acquisition are included in these financial statements.
On July 31, 2002, the Company acquired the global Clysar  shrink film business of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company for a cash price of $142.0 million, subsequently reduced by a working capital adjustment of $6.2 million. This business, now known as Bemis Clysar, Inc., is a global supplier of premium polyolefin shrink film used primarily in total over-wrap applications for the display, protective packaging, and food markets. Operating from plants in Clinton, Iowa, and Le Trait, France, this business had annual sales in 2001 of approximately $100.0 million (unaudited). The net cash purchase price has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting reflecting the provisions of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142. The final purchase price allocation included $45.8 million to tangible assets, $18.7 million to intangible assets, $8.8 million to liabilities assumed, $78.0 million to tax deductible goodwill, and $2.1 million to non-deductible goodwill. Intangible assets acquired had a weighted-average useful life of approximately 12.8 years and include $9.6 million for technology-based intangibles with a useful life of 17.4 years, $5.0 million for marketing related intangibles with a useful life of 10 years, and $4.1 million for customer-based intangibles with a useful life of 10 years. Results of operations from the date of acquisition are included in these financial statements.
27 Note 6  RESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS In July 2003, the Company committed to a plan to close three flexible packaging plants: Murphysboro, Illinois; Union City, California; and Prattville, Alabama. The closure of these plants, together with related support staff and capacity reductions within the flexible packaging business segment, has reduced fixed costs and improved capacity utilization elsewhere in the Company. During the third quarter 2003, manufacturing activity at the three plants was concluded with customer order fulfillment absorbed by other facilities within the flexible packaging segment. This plan is completed except for the clean-up and disposal of the remaining two plants.
During 2003, the Company incurred charges of $5.0 million for employee severance (314 employees terminated), $7.1 million for accelerated depreciation, $0.7 million for equipment and employee relocation, and $1.1 million for other related costs. During 2004, the Company incurred charges of $0.1 million for accelerated depreciation, $0.4 million for equipment and employee relocation, and $0.2 million for other related costs. This restructuring effort is essentially complete with minor costs to be incurred to maintain vacated facilities until sold. In addition during 2004, the Company realized a $1.4 million gain on the disposition of the Union City, California plant, and expects to realize small gains on the sales of each of the other vacated facilities. No realized or anticipated gains are included in the total costs reflected above.
In October 2003, the Company committed to a plan to close two pressure sensitive materials plants: North Las Vegas, Nevada, and Brampton, Ontario, Canada. The closure of these plants, together with related support staff and capacity reductions within the pressure sensitive materials business segment, has reduced fixed costs and improved capacity utilization elsewhere in this business segment. This plan is completed except for the clean-up and disposal of the remaining plant which is expected to occur in 2005 and for which a small gain is expected to be realized.
During 2003, the Company incurred charges of $2.3 million for employee severance (81 employees terminated), $0.1 million for accelerated depreciation, and $0.3 million for other related costs. During 2004, the Company incurred charges of $0.3 million for employee severance, $1.0 million for accelerated depreciation, $1.0 million for equipment and employee relocation, and $0.8 million for other related costs. No realized or anticipated gains are included in the total costs reflected above.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, employee severance, equipment relocation, and other related costs totaling $0.8 million have been included as a component of other costs (income) in the consolidated statement of income, while the accelerated depreciation costs and inventory write-offs of $0.1 million are included in cost of products sold. Facilities consolidation and relocation costs have been expensed as incurred. For the year 2003, a total of $8.9 million has been charged to other costs (income), $7.6 million has been charged to cost of products sold, and $0.1 million has been charged to selling, general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of income. For the year 2004, a total of $2.6 million has been charged to other costs (income), $1.1 million has been charged to cost of products sold, and $0.1 million has been charged to selling, general and administrative expense within the consolidated statement of income. In addition, the $1.4 million gain on the first quarter 2004 sale of the Union City, California plant (which was closed in the third quarter of 2003) is included in other costs (income). The accrued liability remaining at December 31, 2004, will be paid in 2005.

Total contribution expense for these plans was $1,262,000 in 2004, $1,204,000 in 2003, and $971,000 in 2002. Multiemployer plans cover employees at three different manufacturing locations and provide for contributions to a union administered defined benefit pension plan. Amounts charged to pension cost and contributed to the multiemployer plans in 2004, 2003, and 2002 totaled $1,700,000, $771,000, and $732,000, respectively. The 2004 expense included a multiemployer plan withdrawal charge of $995,000 (included in other costs (income) on the consolidated statement of income) associated with the closure of the Murphysboro, Illinois facility.
The Company also has defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of U.S. employees, along with non-US defined benefit plans covering select employees in various international locations. The benefits under the plans are based on years of service and salary levels. Certain plans covering hourly employees provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. In addition, the Company also sponsors an unfunded supplemental retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of limits under the federal tax law and increased benefits to reflect a service adjustment factor. Net periodic pension cost for defined benefit plans included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002: (in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Service cost - benefits earned during the   year $ 18,448 $ 14,066 $ 12,129 Interest cost on projected benefit   obligation 28,374 25,895 24,884 Expected return on plan assets (34,675 ) (35,552 ) (41,996 ) Amortization of unrecognized transition   obligation 404 335 987 Amortization of prior service cost 2,244 1,895 1,431 Recognized actuarial net (gain) or loss 7,483 1,014 (2,309 ) Net periodic pension (income) cost $ 22,278 $ 7,653 $ (4,874 ) Changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, and a reconciliation of the funded status at December 31, 2004 and 2003, are as follows: U.S. pension plans Non-U.S. pension plans (in thousands) 2004 2003 2004 2003 Change in Benefit Obligation: Benefit obligation at the beginning of the   year $ 420,705 $ 369,614 $ 49,869 $ 26,806 Opening benefit obligation for new plans 2,102 Service cost 15,526 11,961 2,922 2,105 Interest cost 25,588 24,214 2,786 1,681 Participant contributions 466 408 Plan amendments 4,161 2,704 Actuarial (gain) or loss 21,646 32,260 (926 ) 11,378 Benefits paid (20,621 ) (20,048 ) (1,184 ) (1,304 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes 4,070 6,693 Benefit obligation at the end of the year $ 467,005 $ 420,705 $ 58,003 $ 49,869 Accumulated benefit obligation at the end   of the year $ 422,575 $ 378,648 $ 44,701 $ 36,770 Change in Plan Assets: Fair value of plan assets at the beginning   of the year $ 349,719 $ 262,795 $ 35,442 $ 24,383 Opening plan assets for new plans 941 Actual return on plan assets 25,162 66,055 3,148 4,163 Employer contributions 50,874 40,917 2,958 2,080 Participant contributions 466 408 Benefits paid (20,621 ) (20,048 ) (1,184 ) (1,304 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes 3,063 4,771 Fair value of plan assets at the end of the   year $ 405,134 $ 349,719 $ 43,893 $ 35,442 Reconciliation of Funded Status: Funded (unfunded) status $ (61,871 ) $ (70,986 ) $ (14,110 ) $ (14,427 ) Unrecognized actuarial net (gain) or loss 135,708 113,962 11,232 12,605 Unrecognized transition obligation 59 316 3,459 3,355 Unrecognized prior service cost 18,193 16,271 58 60 Net amount recognized in consolidated   balance sheet $ 92,089 $ 59,563 $ 639 $ 1,593 Amount recognized in consolidated balance   sheet consists of: Prepaid benefit cost $ 75,558 $ 53,068 $ 369 Accrued benefit liability (33,211 ) (34,489 ) $ (1,731 ) (3,145 ) Intangible asset 9,598 6,827 504 20 Deferred tax 15,536 13,151 722 1,674 Accumulated other comprehensive income 24,608 21,006 1,144 2,675 Net amount recognized in consolidated   balance sheet $ 92,089 $ 59,563 $ 639 $ 1,593 29 The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $467,276,000 and $415,418,000 at December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Presented below are the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.
Projected Benefit Obligation Accumulated Benefit Obligation Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans Assets Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans Assets U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans (in thousands) 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Projected benefit obligation $ 146,186 $ 420,705 $ 51,558 $ 48,207 $ 146,186 $ 131,439 $ 46,942 $ 41,090 Accumulated benefit obligation 141,423 378,648 38,731 35,492 141,423 125,976 35,833 31,397 Fair value of plan assets 108,213 349,719 37,047 33,558 108,213 91,489 33,409 28,991 The Companys general funding policy is to make contributions as required by applicable regulations and when beneficial to the Company for tax and planning purposes. The employer contributions for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, were $53,832,000 and $42,997,000, respectively. The expected plan asset cash contribution for 2005 is $3,986,000 which is expected to satisfy plan funding requirements and regulatory funding requirements.
Total multiemployer plan, defined contribution, and defined benefit pension (expense) income in 2004, 2003, and 2002 was ($25,240,000), ($9,628,000), and $3,171,000, respectively. In addition to these plans, the Company also sponsors a 401(k) savings plan for substantially all U.S. employees. The Company contributes $0.50 for every pre-tax $1.00 an employee contributes on the first two percent of eligible compensation plus $0.25 for every pre-tax $1.00 an employee contributes on the next six percent of eligible compensation. Additionally, for each year in which specified financial targets are met, the Company will increase its annual matching by 25 percent or 50 percent. Contributions are invested in Company stock and are fully vested after three years of service. Total Company contributions for 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $6,667,000, $4,410,000, and $4,314,000.
For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the U.S. pension plans represented approximately 90 percent and 91 percent, respectively, of the Companys total plan assets, and approximately 89 percent and 89 percent, respectively, of the Companys total projected benefit obligation. Considering the significance of the U.S. pension plans in comparison with the Companys total pension plans, we separately present and discuss the critical pension assumptions related to the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. pension plans.
The Companys actuarial valuation date is December 31. The weighted-average discount rates and rates of increase in future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the years ended December 31, are as follows: U.S. pension plans Non-U.S. pension plans 2004 2003 2004 2003 Weighted-average discount rate 5.75 % 6.25 % 5.03 % 5.63 % Rate of increase in future compensation   levels 4.75 % 4.75 % 4.14 % 4.34 % The weighted-average discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and rates of increase in future compensation levels used to determine the net benefit cost for the years ended December 31, are as follows: U.S. pension plans Non-U.S. pension plans 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Weighted-average discount rate 6.25 % 6.75 % 7.00 % 5.57 % 5.71 % 5.93 % Expected return on plan assets 9.00 % 9.50 % 10.00 % 6.85 % 6.84 % 6.85 % Rate of increase in future compensation   levels 4.75 % 5.00 % 5.50 % 4.55 % 4.39 % 3.64 % 30 The weighted average plan asset allocation at December 31, 2004, and 2003, and target allocation (not weighted) for 2005, are as follows: U.S. pension plans Non-U.S. pension plans 2005 Percentage 2005 Percentage Target of plan assets Target of plan assets Asset Category Allocation 2004 2003 Allocation 2004 2003 Equity Securities 80 % 81 % 85 % 47 % 40 % 48 % Debt Securities 20 % 19 % 15 % 26 % 32 % 25 % Other 27 % 28 % 27 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid: (in thousands) U.S. pension plans Non-U.S. pension plans 2005 $ 21,663 $ 742 2006 22,958 658 2007 24,142 1,283 2008 25,278 1,822 2009 26,640 1,442 Years 2010-2014 155,467 14,653 As of January 1, 2005, we have assumed that the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.75 percent. This represents a decrease from the 9.0 percent level assumed for 2004 and 9.5 percent level assumed for 2003. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered historical returns and future expectations. Using historical long-term investment periods of 10, 15, and 20 years, our pension plan assets have earned compound annual rates of return of 10.9 percent, 10.1 percent, and 11.1 percent, respectively, each in excess of our assumed rates. In future years, we expect that returns will be lower than the historical returns discussed above due to a generally lower inflation and interest rate environment. Considering this, we selected an 8.75 percent long-term rate of return on assets assumption as of January 1, 2005. Using our target asset allocation for plan assets of 80 percent equity securities and 20 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long-term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable.
At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December 31, 2004, we determined this rate to be 5.75 percent, a decrease of one half of one percent from the rate used at December 31, 2003.
For our non-U.S. pension plans we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates, to be used in our actuarial calculations for the pension plans offered in each individual country. We tailor each of these assumptions in accordance with the historical market performance and prevailing market expectations for each respective country. As a result, each pension plan contains unique assumptions, which reflect the general market environment within each respective country, and are often quite different from the corresponding assumptions applied to our U.S. pension plans.
Note 8 - POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS The Company sponsors several defined postretirement benefit plans that cover a majority of salaried and a portion of nonunion hourly employees. These plans provide health care benefits and, in some instances, provide life insurance benefits. Except for one closed-group plan, which is noncontributory, postretirement health care plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans are noncontributory.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare and, in certain circumstances, a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. The Companys U.S. postretirement health care plan offers prescription drug benefits. In accordance with FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, any measures of the accumulated projected benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the Act on the plan as the benefits under the plan which are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D under the Act are not considered significant. The Company has not concluded if plan amendments will be effected to obtain greater benefit from the new legislation.
Net periodic postretirement benefit costs included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.
(in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Service cost - benefits earned during the   year $ 614 $ 414 $ 318 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement   benefit obligation 1,298 1,101 1,060 Amortization of prior service cost 72 72 48 Recognized actuarial net (gain) or loss 95 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 2,079 $ 1,587 $ 1,426 31 Changes in benefit obligation and plan assets, and a reconciliation of the funded status at December 31, 2004 and 2003, are as follows: (in thousands) 2004 2003 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation at the beginning of the   year $ 21,424 $ 16,958 Service cost 614 414 Interest cost 1,298 1,101 Plan amendments (904 ) Actuarial (gain) or loss (694 ) 4,301 Benefits paid (990 ) (1,350 ) Benefit obligation at the end of the year $ 20,748 $ 21,424 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets at the beginning   of the year $ 0 $ 0 Employer contribution 990 1,350 Benefits paid (990 ) (1,350 ) Fair value of plan assets at the end of the   year $ 0 $ 0 Reconciliation of Funded Status Funded status $ (20,748 ) $ (21,424 ) Unrecognized net actuarial (gain) or loss 2,497 3,287 Unrecognized prior service cost (472 ) 503 Accrued postretirement benefit liability $ (18,723 ) $ (17,634 ) The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid: (in thousands) Benefit Payments 2005 $ 1,262 2006 1,268 2007 1,393 2008 1,438 2009 1,575 2010-2014 9,338 The employer contributions for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, were $990,000 and $1,350,000, respectively. The expected plan asset contribution for 2005 is $1,262,000. The $1,262,000 cash contribution is expected to satisfy plan funding requirements.
The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For measurement purposes, an 11.0 percent and 12.0 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2004 and 2003, respectively; the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0 percent by the year 2011 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care trends would have the following effects: One Percentage One Percentage (in thousands) Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total of service and interest   cost components for 2004 $ 215 $ (186 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation   at December 31, 2004 $ 1,886 $ (1,656 ) The Companys actuarial valuation date is December 31. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the net postretirement projected benefit obligation for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are 5.75 percent and 6.25 percent, respectively. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the net postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 are 6.25 percent, 6.75 percent, and 7.0 percent, respectively.
Note 9  STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS Since 1987, the Companys stock option and stock award plans have provided for the issuance of up to 13,800,000 shares of common stock to key employees. As of December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, 2,020,520, 3,252,888, and 3,596,918, shares were available for future grants under these plans. Shares forfeited by the employee become available for future grants.
Options are granted at prices equal to fair market value on the date of the grant and are exercisable, upon vesting, over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant. Options for directors vest immediately, while options for Company employees generally vest over three years (one-third per year).

The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during 2003 and 2002 used in computing pro forma compensation expense disclosed in Note 1 was $9.91, and $10.04 per share, respectively. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2003 2002 Dividend yield 2.3 % 2.1 % Expected volatility 29.2 % 29.0 % Risk-free interest rate 6.75 % 6.75 % Expected lives (in   years) 10.0 10.0 In 1994 and in 2001, the Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan for certain key executive employees. The 1994 and 2001 Plans provide for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 grants, respectively. Each Plan expires 10 years after its inception, at which point no further stock options or performance units may be granted. Since 1994, 3,932,910 and 3,046,570 grants of either stock options or performance units (commonly referred to as restricted stock) have been made under the 1994 and 2001 plans, respectively. Distribution of the performance units is normally made in the form of shares of the Companys common stock on a one for one basis. Distribution of the shares will normally be made not less than three years, nor more than six years, from the date of the performance unit grant. All performance units granted under the plan are subject to restrictions as to continuous employment, except in the case of death, permanent disability, or retirement. In addition, cash payments are made during the grant period on outstanding performance units equal to the dividend on Bemis common stock. The cost of the awards is charged to income over the vesting period. Total compensation expense related to these Plans was $13,776,000 in 2004, $10,666,000 in 2003, and $15,210,000 in 2002.
Details of the stock award plan at December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, are: 2004 2003 2002 Outstanding shares granted at the beginning   of the year 2,501,620 2,891,672 2,992,110 Shares Granted 1,372,644 206,004 195,648 Shares Paid (849,258 ) (471,898 ) (199,362 ) Shares Canceled (138,308 ) (124,158 ) (96,724 ) Outstanding shares granted at the end of   the year 2,886,698 2,501,620 2,891,672 33 Note 10  LEASES The Company has operating leases for manufacturing plants, land, warehouses, machinery and equipment, and administrative offices that expire at various times over the next 37 years. Under most leasing arrangements, the Company pays the property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other expenses related to the leased property. Total rental expense under operating leases was approximately $13,137,000 in 2004, $12,836,000 in 2003, and $13,330,000 in 2002.
The Company has capitalized leases for a manufacturing site and some machinery and equipment that expire at various times over the next five years. The present values of minimum future obligations shown in the following chart are calculated based on an interest rate of approximately 4.0 percent, which is the lessors implicit rate of return. Interest expense on the outstanding obligations under capital leases was approximately $21,000 in 2004, $32,000 in 2003, and $8,000 in 2002.
Minimum future obligations on leases in effect at December 31, 2004, are: (in thousands) Capital Leases Operating Leases 2005 $ 200 $ 6,767 2006 209 4,165 2007 219 3,264 2008 57 2,536 2009 55 1,846 Thereafter 0 7,388 Total minimum obligations $ 740 $ 25,966 Less amount representing interest 115 Present value of net minimum obligations $ 625 Less current portion 168 Long-term obligations $ 457 Note 11  LONG-TERM DEBT Debt consisted of the following at December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 Commercial paper payable through 2005 at an   interest rate of 2.3% $ 160,380 $ 194,000 Notes payable in 2008 at an interest rate   of 6.5% 250,000 250,000 Notes payable in 2005 at an interest rate   of 6.7% 100,000 100,000 Interest rate swap agreement 14,943 22,589 Industrial revenue bond payable through 2012   at an interest rate of 2.2% 8,000 15,500 Debt of subsidiary company payable through 2005   at an interest rate of 6.68% 850 1,772 Obligations under capital leases 625 651 Total debt 534,798 584,512 Less current portion 912 1,113 Total long-term debt $ 533,886 $ 583,399 The commercial paper has been classified as long-term debt, to the extent of available long-term backup credit agreements, in accordance with the Companys intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The interest rate of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004, was 2.3 percent. The maximum outstanding during 2004 was $223,910,000, and the average outstanding during 2004 was $187,010,000. The weighted-average interest rate during 2004 was 1.4 percent.
As described in Note 2, the Company issued approximately $250.0 million of additional commercial paper in January 2005 to fund the acquisition of Dixie Toga S.A. During the first half of 2005, the Company anticipates issuing long-term notes, the proceeds of which will be used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. The notes are anticipated to be sold to qualified institutional buyers under the provisions of Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with this proposed debt offering, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap arrangement in February 2005 which effectively fixed the associated interest rate.
The industrial revenue bond has a variable interest rate which is determined weekly by a Remarketing Agent based on similar debt then available. The weighted-average interest rate at December 31, 2004, was 2.2 percent. The Company had two industrial revenue bonds outstanding for the majority of 2004. The weighted-average interest rate during 2004 was 1.4 percent.
Long-term debt maturing in years 2005 through 2009 is $100,912,000, $143,000, $140,000, $250,140,000, and $160,520,000, respectively.
Under the terms of a revolving credit agreement with eight banks, the Company may borrow up to $500.0 million through September 2, 2009. The Company currently pays a facility fee of 0.08 percent annually on the entire amount of the commitment. There were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at December 31, 2004. This credit facility is used primarily to support the Companys issuance of commercial paper.
34 The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $350.0 million in the third quarter of 2001, effectively converting a portion of the Companys interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate basis to hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap agreements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as interest rates change. The interest rate swap agreements have been designated as hedges of the fair value of the Companys fixed rate long-term debt obligations: $100.0 million, 6.7 percent notes due July 1, 2005, and $250.0 million, 6.5 percent notes due August 15, 2008.
The variable rate on all three of the interest rate swaps is based on the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), set in arrears, plus a fixed spread. The variable rates are reset semi-annually at each net settlement date. The net settlement benefit to the Company, which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense, was $15.0 million, $15.3 million and $13.7 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of these interest rate swaps was $14.9 million and $22.6 million in the Companys favor, as determined by the respective counterparties using discounted cash flow or other appropriate methodologies, and is included with deferred charges and other assets with a corresponding increase in long-term debt.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on $223,255,000 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. The Company is currently studying the impact of the one-time foreign dividend provisions enacted in October 2004 as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As of December 31, 2004, and based on the tax laws in effect at that time, it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings and, accordingly, no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection therewith.
Note 13  SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS The Companys business activities are organized around its two principal business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure, with no significant differences in accounting policies applied. Minor intersegment sales are generally priced to reflect nominal markups. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on operating profit, which is defined as profit before general corporate expense, interest expense, income taxes, and minority interest. While there are similarities in selected technology and manufacturing processes utilized between the Companys business segments, notable differences exist in products, application and distribution of products, and customer base.
Products produced within the Flexible Packaging business segment service packaging applications for markets such as food, medical devices, personal care, agribusiness, chemicals, pet food, and tissue. Products produced within the Pressure Sensitive Materials business segment include film, paper, and metalized plastic film printing stocks used for primary package labeling, promotional decoration, bar code inventory control labels, and laser printing for administrative office and promotional applications. This segment also includes micro-thin film adhesives used in delicate electronic parts assembly and graphic films for decorative signage.
A summary of the Companys business activities reported by its two business segments follows: BUSINESS SEGMENTS (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net Sales: Flexible Packaging $ 2,250.1 $ 2,101.6 $ 1,871.3 Pressure Sensitive Materials 584.8 534.2 499.1 Intersegment Sales: Flexible Packaging (0.5 ) (0.7 ) (1.2 ) Pressure Sensitive Materials (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Net Sales to Unaffiliated Customers $ 2,834.4 $ 2,635.0 $ 2,369.0 Operating Profit and Pretax Profit: Flexible Packaging $ 308.3 $ 263.8 $ 289.1 Pressure Sensitive Materials 33.9 16.3 27.3 Total operating profit (1) 342.2 280.1 316.4 General corporate expenses (32.5 ) (27.5 ) (33.0 ) Interest expense (15.5 ) (12.6 ) (15.5 ) Minority interest in net income (0.5 ) (0.8 ) (0.9 ) Income before income taxes $ 293.7 $ 239.2 $ 267.0 Identifiable Assets: Flexible Packaging $ 1,869.8 $ 1,780.8 $ 1,763.8 Pressure Sensitive Materials 428.2 386.5 358.2 Total identifiable assets (2) 2,298.0 2,167.3 2,122.0 Corporate assets (3) 188.7 125.6 134.7 Total $ 2,486.7 $ 2,292.9 $ 2,256.7 Depreciation and Amortization: Flexible Packaging $ 113.6 $ 109.8 $ 100.4 Pressure Sensitive Materials 15.4 16.5 17.0 Corporate 1.8 1.9 1.8 Total $ 130.8 $ 128.2 $ 119.2 Expenditures for Property and Equipment: Flexible Packaging $ 120.9 $ 99.2 $ 85.0 Pressure Sensitive Materials 13.5 6.4 4.9 Corporate 0.1 0.9 1.1 Total $ 134.5 $ 106.5 $ 91.0 36 OPERATIONS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA 2004 2003 2002 (in   millions) Net Sales to Unaffiliated Customers: (4) United States $ 2,140.1 $ 2,026.6 $ 1,930.6 Canada 76.7 75.4 86.3 Europe 553.6 468.3 298.9 Other 64.0 64.7 53.2 Total $ 2,834.4 $ 2,635.0 $ 2,369.0 Identifiable Assets: United States $ 1,722.4 $ 1,665.0 $ 1,713.6 Canada 36.8 32.5 33.0 Europe 471.7 412.4 329.1 Other 67.1 57.4 46.3 Total $ 2,298.0 $ 2,167.3 $ 2,122.0 (1) Operating profit is defined   as profit before general corporate expense, interest expense, income taxes,   and minority interest.

Note 14  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is a defendant in lawsuits incidental to its business. The management of the Company believes, except as discussed below, that the disposition of these lawsuits will not have any material impact on the financial position or operating results of the Company.
The Company first disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April23, 2003, that the Department of Justice expected to initiate a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry and the Company further discussed the investigation and disclosed that it expected to receive a subpoena in its Form 10-Q filed for the quarter ended June30, 2003. In a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August15, 2003, the Company disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the Departments criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry. The Company has responded to the subpoena and will continue to cooperate fully with the requests of the Department of Justice.
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Morgan Adhesives Company, have been named as defendants inten civil lawsuits. Five of theselawsuits purport to represent a nationwide class of labelstock purchasers, and each alleges a conspiracy to fix prices within the self-adhesive labelstock industry. On November5, 2003, the Judicial Panel on MultiDistrict Litigation issued a decision consolidating all of the federal class actions for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, before the Honorable Chief Judge Vanaskie. Judge Vanaskie entered an order which calls for discovery to be taken on the issues relating to class certification and briefing on plaintiffs motion for class certification to be completed inNovember2005. At this time, a discovery cut-off and a trial date have not been set. TheCompanyhas also been named in four lawsuits filed in the California Superior Court in San Francisco. Three of these lawsuits seek to represent a class of all California indirect purchasers of labelstock and each alleged a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. These three lawsuits havebeen consolidated. Thefourth lawsuit seeks torepresent a class ofCalifornia direct purchasers of labelstock and alleges a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. Finally, the Company has been named in one lawsuit in Vermont, seeking to represent a class of allVermont indirect purchasers of labelstock and alleging a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. The Company intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.
In a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 25, 2004, the Company disclosed that representatives from the European Commission had commenced a search of business records and interviews of certain Company personnel at itsself-adhesive labelstockoperation in Soignies, Belgium to investigate possible violations of European competition law in connection with an investigation of potential anticompetitive activities in the European paper and forestry products sector. The Company continues to cooperate fully with the European Commission.
37 Given the ongoing status of the Department of Justice investigation, the related class-action civil lawsuits, and the European Commission investigation, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters although the effect could be material to the results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved. The Company is currently not otherwise subject to any pending litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of the Company.
Note 15  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months and relate primarily to major Western European currencies. The Company has not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $3,531,000 and $5,196,000, respectively. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to active forward exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as part of accounts payable and as an expense element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and was not significant at December 31, 2004 and 2003.
The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt resulting from interest rate fluctuations. To hedge this exposure, the Company entered into three fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps during the third quarter of 2001. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as a fair value hedge. The terms of the interest rate swap agreements have been specifically designed to conform to the applicable terms of the hedged items and with the requirements of paragraph 68 of SFAS No. 133 to support the assumption of no ineffectiveness (changes in fair value of the debt and the swaps exactly offset). The fair value of these three interest rate swaps is recorded within long-term debt. Changes in the payment of interest resulting from the interest rate swaps are recorded as an offset to interest expense. See Note 11 for further discussion of the interest rate swaps.
The Companys non-derivative financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including current maturities but excluding capitalized leases, is estimated to be $534,215,000 and $584,008,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, using discounted cash flow analyses and based on the incremental borrowing rates currently available to the Company for similar debt with similar terms and maturity.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties in interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of the Company. In the unlikely event a counterparty fails to meet the contractual terms of an interest rate swap or foreign exchange forward contract, the Companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instrument. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company has not had any historical instances of non-performance by any counterparties, nor does it anticipate any future instances of non-performance. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and countries. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.

38 ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable.
ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Managements Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Registrants management, under the direction, supervision, and involvement of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)) of the Registrant. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures in place at the Registrant are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrant in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Bemis Company, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f). Under the direction, supervision, and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Registrants management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-Framework).
