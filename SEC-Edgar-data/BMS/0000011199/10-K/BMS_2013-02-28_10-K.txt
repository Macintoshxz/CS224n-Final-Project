Wulf, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, pursuant to   Section1350, dated February27, 2009 53 2 Table of Contents PARTI  ITEMS 1, 1A, 1B, 2, 3, and 4 ITEM 1  BUSINESS Bemis Company,Inc., a Missouri corporation (the Registrant or Company), continues a business formed in 1858. The Company was incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company with the name changed to Bemis Company,Inc. in 1965. The Company is a principal manufacturer of flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials, selling to customers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. In 2008, approximately 83 percent of the Companys sales were derived from the Flexible Packaging segment and approximately 17 percent were derived from the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment.
The Companys products are sold to customers primarily in the food industry. Other customers include companies in the following types of businesses: chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. Further information about the Companys operations in its business segments is available at Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
As of December31, 2008, the Company had approximately 15,400 employees, about 10,200 of whom were classified as production employees. Many of the North American production employees are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving three different international unions, one independent union, and 16 individual contracts with terms ranging from one to five years. During 2008, three contracts covering approximately 600 employees at three different locations in the United States were successfully negotiated while two contracts covering approximately 120 employees at one domestic location continue to be negotiated. Five domestic labor agreements covering approximately 1,400 employees are scheduled to expire in 2009. Many of the non-North American production employees as well as some of the non-North American salaried workforce are covered by collective bargaining contracts involving 23 different unions with terms ranging from one to two years.
Working capital elements fluctuate throughout the year in relation to the level of customer volume and other marketplace conditions. Inventory levels reflect a reasonable balance between raw material pricing and availability, and the Companys commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which the Company operates. The business of each of the segments is not seasonal to any significant extent.
The Company is the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of its products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. The Company also has a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign countries. The Companys patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results as a whole or those of either of its segments.
The Companys business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure. A summary of the Companys business activities reported by its two business segments follows.
Flexible Packaging Segment The flexible packaging segment manufactures a broad range of food, consumer goods, and industrial packaging. Multilayer flexible polymer film structures and laminates are sold for food, medical, and personal care products as well as non-food applications utilizing vacuum or modified atmosphere packaging. Additional products include blown and cast stretchfilm products, carton sealing tapes and application equipment, custom thermoformed plastic packaging, multiwall paper bags, printed paper roll stock, and bag closing materials. Markets for our products include processed and fresh meat, liquids, frozen foods, cereals, snacks, cheese, coffee, condiments, candy, pet food, bakery, seed, lawn and garden, tissue, fresh produce, personal care and hygiene, disposable diapers, printed shrink overwrap for the food and beverage industry, agribusiness, pharmaceutical, minerals, and medical device packaging.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Segment The pressure sensitive materials segment manufactures pressure sensitive adhesive coated paper and film substrates sold into label markets, graphic markets, and technical markets.
Products for label markets include narrow-web rolls of pressure sensitive paper, film, and metalized film printing stocks used in high-speed printing and die-cutting of primary package labeling, secondary or promotional decoration, and for high-speed, high-volume electronic data processing (EDP) stocks, bar code labels, and numerous laser printing applications. Primary markets include food and consumer goods, inventory control labeling, shipping labels, postage stamps, and laser/ink jet printed labels.
Products for graphic markets include pressure sensitive films used for decorative signage through computer-aided plotters, digital and screen printers, and photographic overlaminate and mounting materials including optically clear films with built-in UV inhibitors. Offset printers, sign makers, and photo labs use these products on short-run and/or digital printing technology to create signs or vehicle graphics. Primary markets are indoor and outdoor signage, photograph and digital print overlaminates, and vehicle graphics.
Products for technical markets are pressure sensitive materials that are technically engineered for performance in varied industrial applications. They include micro-thin film adhesives used in delicate electronic parts assembly and pressure sensitives utilizing foam and tape based stocks to perform fastening and mounting functions. Tapes sold to medical markets feature medical-grade adhesives suitable for direct skin contact. Primary markets are electronics, automotive, construction, medical, and pharmaceuticals.
3 Table of Contents Marketing, Distribution, and Competition While the Companys sales are made through a variety of distribution methods, more than 90 percent of each segments sales are made by the Companys direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Asia Pacific, South America, and Mexico to provide prompt and economical service to more than 30,000 customers. The Companys technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, and a customer service organization.
No single customer accounts for ten percent or more of the Companys total sales. Furthermore, the loss of one or a few major customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results. Nevertheless, business arrangements with large customers require a large portion of the manufacturing capacity at a few individual manufacturing sites. Any change in the business arrangement would typically occur over a period of time, which would allow for an orderly transition for both the Companys manufacturing site and the customer.
The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms. Major competitors in the Flexible Packaging segment include Alcan Packaging, Amcor Limited, Exopack Company, Hood Packaging Corporation, Bryce Corporation, Pliant Corporation, Printpack,Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Sonoco Products Company, Winpak Ltd., and Wihuri OY. In the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment major competitors include 3M, Acucote,Inc., Avery Dennison Corporation, Flexcon Corporation, Green Bay Packaging Inc., Ricoh Company, Ltd., Ritrama Inc., Spinnaker Industries,Inc., Technicote Inc., UPM-Kymmene Corporation, and Wausau Coated Products Inc.
The Company considers itself to be a significant factor in the market niches it serves; however, due to the diversity of the Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials segments, the Companys precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. Advertising is limited primarily to business and trade publications emphasizing the Companys product features and related technical capabilities and the individual problem-solving approach to customer problems.
Raw Materials Plastic resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, and chemicals constitute the basic major raw materials. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources and the Company is not dependent on any one supplier for its raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, the Company expects to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currently, raw materials are readily available.
Research and Development Expense Research and development expenditures were as follows: (inthousands) 2008 2007 2006 Flexible   Packaging $ 17,646 $ 19,477 $ 20,036 Pressure   Sensitive Materials 7,364 6,506 4,988 Total $ 25,010 $ 25,983 $ 25,024 Environmental Control Compliance with federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating discharges of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company and its subsidiaries.

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS Domestic and international economic conditions.
Disruption in the domestic and international equity and financial markets has negatively impacted the United States economy as well as international markets in which we conduct business. We are not able to predict the future impact of this global financial crisis on our liquidity and consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Funded status of pension plans  Recognition of pension liabilities may cause a significant reduction in stockholders equity.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans , requires balance sheet recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. If the fair value of our pension plans assets at a future reporting date decreases or if the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation (PBO) as of that date decreases, we will be required to record the incremental change in the excess of PBO over the fair value of the assets as a reduction of stockholders equity. The resulting non-cash after-tax charge would not reduce reported 5 Table of Contents earnings as this amount would represent future expense. It would be recorded directly as a decrease in the Other Comprehensive Income component of stockholders equity. While we cannot estimate the future funded status of our pension liability with any certainty at this time, we believe that if the market value of assets or the discount rate used to calculate our pension liability materially decreases, the adjustment could significantly reduce our stockholders equity. A significant reduction in stockholders equity may impact our compliance with debt covenants or could cause a downgrade in our credit ratings that could also adversely impact our future cost and speed of borrowing and have an adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We have identified pension assumptions as critical accounting estimates. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Estimates and JudgmentsAccounting for pension costs and Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Goodwill and other intangible assets  A significant write down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth.
On January1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS No.142). We no longer amortize goodwill, but we review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year using the business valuation methods required by FAS No.142. These methods include the use of a weighted-average cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangibles as a critical accounting estimate. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Estimates and JudgmentsIntangible assets and goodwill included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Foreign operations  Conditions in foreign countries and changes in foreign exchange rates may reduce our reported results of operations.
We have operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, and Asia. In 2008, approximately 36 percent of our sales were generated by entities operating outside of the United States. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction and translation losses. In addition, our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions, political situations, and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries, as to which we have no control.
Interest rates  An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.
At December31, 2008, our variable rate borrowings approximated $380.7 million. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations. Accordingly, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, our annual interest expense would increase by $3.8 million on the $380.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of December31, 2008.
Credit rating  A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs. Our credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. A downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing by increasing the spread over prevailing market rates that we pay for our commercial paper or the fees associated with our bank credit facility. In addition, our bank credit facility has covenants that include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. If for any reason our existing credit arrangements were no longer available to us we would be required to seek alternative sources of financing. We would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would further increase our borrowing costs.
Raw materials  Raw material cost increases or shortages could adversely affect our results of operations.
As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the availability and cost of raw materials, which are subject to price fluctuations. Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials have occurred in the past and are expected to recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to reflect changes in costs in selling prices for our products. In the past, we have been generally successful in managing increased raw material costs and increasing selling prices when necessary. Past performance may or may not be replicable in the future. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, in addition to terrorist activity and government regulation of environmental emissions, may negatively impact the production or delivery capacity of our raw material suppliers in the chemical and paper industries. This could result in increased raw material costs or supply shortages, which may have a negative impact on our profitability if we are unable to pass along the increased costs in our selling prices or, in the case of a shortage, secure raw materials from alternative sources.
Patents and proprietary technology  Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to acquire and retain intellectual property rights.
Our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop, acquire, and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success, which ability cannot be assured.
Industry investigations  Several lawsuits have been filed against us related to alleged unlawful competitive activities in the industry in connection with now-concluded investigations of the labelstock industry by the U.S. Department of Justice and of the paper and forest products sector by the European Commission.
In April2003, we were notified by the U.S. Department of Justices Antitrust Division that it expected to initiate a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the labelstock industry, and in August2003 the U.S. Department of Justice issued a subpoena to us in connection with the investigation. In May2004, the European Commission, seeking evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities, initiated inspections and obtained documents from our pressure sensitive materials facility in Belgium. We cooperated fully 6 Table of Contents with these investigations, and both investigations were closed by each agency without further action. We and one of our subsidiaries are named defendants in lawsuits in the United States seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the U.S. Department of Justice investigation. We are unable to predict the outcome of these matters although the effect could be material to the results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved.
Acquisitions  We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire.
We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and are actively seeking new acquisitions that we believe will provide meaningful opportunities to grow our business and improve profitability. Acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, productivity, or otherwise perform as we expect. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies as well as difficulties in integrating acquired businesses. While we believe that our acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, we can give no assurance that acquisitions will be successful or accretive to earnings.
Information technology  A failure in our information technology infrastructure or applications could negatively affect our business.
We depend on information technology to record and process customers orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, and maintain the financial accuracy of our business records. We are in the process of developing and implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that will redesign and deploy new processes and a common information system across our plants over a period of several years. There can be no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to achieve our goals may impact our ability to (1)process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2)remain in step with the changing needs of the trade, which could result in the loss of customers. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue. Finally, failure or abandonment of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project.
Our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.
Numerous other factors over which we may have limited or no control may affect our performance and profitability.
Other factors that may influence our earnings, financial position, and liquidity include: legal and administrative cases and proceedings (whether civil, such as environmental or product related, or criminal), settlements, judgments, and investigations; developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses; adoption of new, or changes in, accounting policies or practices and the application of such policies and practices; changes in business mix; customer and supplier business reorganizations or combinations; increase in cost of debt; ability to retain adequate levels of insurance coverage at acceptable rates; fluctuations in pension and employee benefit costs; loss of significant contract(s); risks and uncertainties relating to investment in development activities and new facilities; timely development and successful market acceptance of new products; pricing of competitive products; disruptions in transportation networks; increased participation in potentially less stable emerging markets; reliability of utility services; impact of computer viruses; general or specific economic conditions and the ability and willingness of purchasers to substitute other products for the products that we manufacture; financial condition and inventory strategies of customers and suppliers; credit risks; changes in customer order patterns; employee work stoppagesat plants; increased competition; changes in government regulations and the impact of changes in the world political environment, including the ability to estimate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on financial results; the impact of epidemiological events on the economy and on our customers and suppliers; and acts of war, terrorism, weather, and other natural disasters.
ITEM 1B  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2  PROPERTIES Properties utilized by the Company at December31, 2008, were as follows: Flexible Packaging Segment This segment has 50 manufacturing plants located in 13 states and ten non-USA countries, of which 45 are owned directly by the Company or its subsidiaries and five are leased from outside parties. Initial lease terms generally provide for minimum terms of five to 15 years and have one or more renewal options. The initial term of leases in effect at December31, 2008, expire between 2009 and 2014.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Segment This segment has seven manufacturing plants located in three states and two non-USA countries, all of which are owned directly by the Company or its subsidiaries.
Corporate and General The Company considers its plants and other physical properties to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of its business. The manufacturing plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on the type of operation and market conditions. The executive offices of the Company, which are leased, are located in Neenah, Wisconsin.
7 Table of Contents ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including environmental related litigation. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, except as discussed below, that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
The Company is a potentially responsible party (PRP) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws in proceedings associated with seventeen sites around the United States. During 2008, the Company was identified as a PRP in four new sites. In addition, two sites previously considered closed have been re-opened for potential further remediation. These proceedings were instituted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies at various times beginning in 1983. Superfund and similar state laws create liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances in the environment. Under these statutes, joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators, site owners and operators, and others regardless of fault. Although these regulations could require the Company to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment at various sites, perform remediation work at such sites, orpay damages for loss of use and non-use values, we expect the Companys liability in these proceedings to be limited to monetary damages. The Company expects its future liability relative to these sites to be insignificant, individually and in the aggregate. The Company has reserved an amount that it believes to be adequate to cover its exposure.
Dixie Toga S.A., acquired by the Company on January5, 2005, is involved in a tax dispute with the City of So Paulo, Brazil. The City imposes a tax on the rendering of printing services. The City has assessed this city services tax on the production and sale of printed labels and packaging products. Dixie Toga, along with a number of other packaging companies, disagrees and contends that the city services tax is not applicable to its products and that the products are subject only to the state value added tax (VAT). Under Brazilian law, state VAT and city services tax are mutually exclusive and the same transaction can be subject to only one of those taxes. Based on a ruling from the State of So Paulo, advice from legal counsel, and long standing business practice, Dixie Toga appealed the city services tax and instead continued to collect and pay only the state VAT.
The City of So Paulo disagreed and assessed Dixie Toga the city services tax for the years 1991-1995. The assessments for those years are estimated to be approximately $47.0 million at the date the Company acquired Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2008 exchange rate. Dixie Toga challenged the assessments and ultimately litigated the issue in two annulment actions filed on November24, 1998 and August16, 1999 in the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo. A decision by the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo in 2002 cancelled all of the assessments for the years 1991-1995. The City of So Paulo, the State of So Paulo, and Dixie Toga have each appealed parts of the lower court decision. In the event of an adverse resolution, the estimated amount for these years could be substantially increased for additional interest, monetary adjustments and costs from the date of acquisition.
The City has also asserted the applicability of the city services tax for the subsequent years 1996-2001 and has issued assessments for those years for Dixie Toga and for Itap Bemis Ltda., a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The assessments for those years were upheld at the administrative level and are being challenged by the companies. The assessments at the date of acquisition for these years for tax and penalties (exclusive of interest and monetary adjustments) are estimated to be approximately $7.1 million for Itap Bemis and $22.8 million for Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2008 exchange rate. In the event of an adverse resolution, the estimated amounts for these years could be increased by $27.1 million for Itap Bemis and $77.9 million for Dixie Toga for interest, monetary adjustments and costs.
The 1996-2001 assessments for Dixie Toga are currently being challenged in the courts. In pursuing its challenge through the courts, taxpayers are generally required, in accordance with court procedures, to pledge assets as security for its lawsuits. Under certain circumstances, taxpayers may avoid the requirement to pledge assets. Dixie Toga has secured a court injunction that avoids the current requirement to pledge assets as security for its lawsuit related to the 1996-2001 assessments.
The Company strongly disagrees with the Citys position and intends to vigorously challenge any assessments by the City of So Paulo. The Company is unable at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of the controversy and as such has not recorded any liability related to this matter. An adverse resolution could be material to the consolidated results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved.
On September18, 2007, the Secretariat of Economic Law (SDE), a governmental agency in Brazil, initiated an investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the Brazilian flexible packaging industry against a number of Brazilian companies including a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The investigation relates to periods prior to the Companys acquisition of control of Dixie Toga and its subsidiaries. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings the Company is unable at the present time to predict the outcome of this matter.
The Company and its subsidiary, Morgan Adhesives Company, have been named as defendants inthirteen civil lawsuits related to an investigation that was initiated and subsequently closed by the U.S. Department of Justice without any further action. Six of theselawsuits purport to represent a nationwide class of labelstock purchasers, and each alleges a conspiracy to fix prices within the self-adhesive labelstock industry. The first of these lawsuits was filed on May27, 2003. In these lawsuits, the plaintiffs seek actual damages for the period of the alleged conspiracy (January1, 1996 through July25, 2003) trebled, plus an award of attorneys fees and costs. On November5, 2003, the Judicial Panel on MultiDistrict Litigation issued a decision consolidating all of the federal class actions for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, before the Honorable Chief Judge Vanaskie. On November20, 2007, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. On March6, 2008, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals denied Defendants petition for leave to appeal the district courts decision granting class certification. On June24, 2008, the Court in the consolidated federal class actions issued a decision dismissing the Company from those actions. On January27, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to decertify the class based on new case law in the Third Circuit. At this time, a discovery cut-off has been set for 8 Table of Contents December21, 2009. However, no trial date has been set. TheCompany and Morgan Adhesives Company have also been named in three lawsuits filed in the California Superior Court in San Francisco. These three lawsuits, which have been consolidated, seek to represent a class of all California indirect purchasers of labelstock and each alleges a conspiracy to fix prices within the self-adhesive labelstock industry. Finally, the Company has been named in one lawsuit in Vermont, seeking to represent a class of allVermont indirect purchasers of labelstock, one lawsuit in Nebraska seeking to represent a class of all Nebraska indirect purchasers of labelstock, one lawsuit in Kansas seeking to represent a class of all Kansas indirect purchasers of labelstock, and one lawsuit in Tennessee, seeking to represent a class of purchasers of labelstock in various jurisdictions, all alleging a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. The Company and Morgan Adhesives Company intend to vigorously defend the state class actions, and Morgan Adhesives Company intends to vigorously defend the federal class actions.
Given the ongoing status of the class-action civil lawsuits, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters although the effect could be material to the results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved. The Company is currently not otherwise subject to any pending litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of the Company.

Generally about 60 percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry. Sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices, personal care, and lawn and garden. Our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment, which accounts for about 83 percent of our net sales. The remaining 17 percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which, while diversified in end use products, is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets.
The markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our leading flexible packaging market positions in North and South America reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value-added, proprietary products. We also manufacture products that are less unique but for which our technical know-how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage. The primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins, films, paper, ink, and adhesives.
Market Conditions During 2008, economic conditions continued to weaken and global financial markets experienced a significant liquidity crisis. Governments around the world have responded to the financial crisis with funding support for their regional financial systems. Consumer spending declined and unemployment in the United States increased. The housing and automotive markets continue to be weak. Commodity prices hit historically high levels during the second and third quarters of 2008, resulting in increased raw material and energy costs for manufacturers. Some of the commodity grade raw material costs steadily decreased throughout the fourth quarter as the global financial crisis widened. Our raw material costs hit historic highs during the year, but by the end of the year certain material costs had declined to early 2007 levels. While lower raw material costs benefit operating profit on a short-term basis, our selling prices will decrease to reflect these lower costs over a few months.
Restructuring and Related Charges In January2006, we announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency. These efforts were substantially complete as of December31, 2006. Total remaining costs incurred in 2007 were substantially offset by restructuring related gains. Restructuring and related charges incurred in 2006 totaled $31.2 million, of which $12.9 million primarily reflected accelerated depreciation and was recorded as a component of cost of products sold. The remaining $18.3 million primarily reflected employee-related costs and was recorded as a component of other costs (income).
Acquisitions In April2006, we acquired the remaining shares of our three majority-owned joint ventures in Mexico for $6.8 million.
Results of Operations Consolidated Overview (inmillions,exceptpershareamounts) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 3,779.4 $ 3,649.3 $ 3,639.4 Net income 166.2 181.6 176.3 Diluted earnings   per share 1.65 1.74 1.65 2008 versus 2007 For the year ended December31, 2008, net sales increased 3.6 percent, reflecting increased raw material costs incorporated into higher selling prices during the year. Unit volume sold into certain food packaging markets increased compared to 2007, while unit volumes declined in advertising, display film, and construction-related markets that are more sensitive to economic conditions. Currency translation benefits increased net sales by 1.7 percent.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for 2008, a 5.2 percent decrease compared to $1.74 per share for 2007. In 2007, diluted earnings per share included $0.02 per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries. Higher raw material costs in 2008 negatively impacted gross margins.
2007 versus 2006 For the year ended December31, 2007, net sales increased 0.3 percent, reflecting a net sales benefit from currency translation of 3.4 percent, offset by a 3.1 percent decrease in net sales related to lower unit sales volume.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.74 for 2007, including a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries. In 2006, diluted earnings per share were $1.65 for 2006, including $0.18 per share of restructuring and related charges.
Flexible Packaging Business Segment Our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets, including meat and cheese, confectionery and snack, frozen foods, lawn and garden, health and hygiene, beverages, medical devices, bakery, and dry foods. The most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins, which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products. Selling price changes lag behind changes in our raw material costs. During 2008, resin costs dramatically increased during the second and third quarters. Certain commodity resin costs subsequently decreased during the fourth quarter. The magnitude and frequency of these cost changes negatively impacted operating profit during 2008.
11 Table of Contents In Januaryof 2006, we announced a restructuring plan to close five flexible packaging plants in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency throughout this business segment. These efforts were substantially completed by December31, 2006. Restructuring and related charges for the flexible packaging business segment totaled $29.0 million in 2006.
(dollarsinmillions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 3,153.2 $ 3,001.8 $ 3,000.1 Operating profit   (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 315.9 346.6 335.1 Operating profit   as a percentage of net sales 10.0 % 11.5 % 11.2 % 2008 versus 2007 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased 5.0 percent in 2008, principally reflecting the impact of higher selling prices. Currency effects accounted for sales growth of 1.4 percent during 2008. Increases in net sales of packaging for meat and cheese, dairy and liquids, bakery products, and medical products markets reflected higher unit volume. These markets represent approximately 48 percent of total flexible packaging net sales. Net sales also increased in packaging for dry foods, health and hygiene, and industrial product markets, driven primarily by higher selling prices. These markets represent approximately 22 percent of flexible packaging net sales. We experienced lower net sales in the remaining 30 percent of our flexible packaging market categories as a result of lower unit volume. These lower volume markets include confectionery and snack markets, pet products, overwrap film for bottled water, frozen foods, lawn and garden, and protective display films. Non-discretionary food markets have historically provided defensive characteristics during times of economic weakness. Markets for protective display films and packaging for discretionary food and consumer products have been negatively impacted during the recent economic downturn. We expect these trends to continue until the economy begins to strengthen and consumer confidence improves.
Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.0 percent in 2008 from 11.5 percent in 2007. Restructuring and related activities increased 2007 operating income by $1.5 million. Raw material prices increased substantially during the first eight months of 2008, and many specialty materials used in our food packaging products maintained those prices through the end of the year. Our method of passing these input costs on to customers through increased selling prices normally occurs with a several month lag and pressures operating profit margins during that period.
2007 versus 2006 Net sales in our flexible packaging business segment were virtually unchanged from 2006 to 2007. A benefit from currency translation of 3.1 percent was completely offset by weak demand across many of our packaging markets. Net sales of packaging for meat and cheese, which represent about 30 percent of our flexible packaging net sales, decreased about 3 percent excluding the impact of currency. Packaging for bakery products and dry foods, for which consumer demand has been impacted by increased wheat prices, experienced a drop in net sales of about 10 percent from 2006 levels. Packaging for pet products and industrial products also decreased over 9 percent in 2007. Packaging for bakery, dry foods, pet products, and industrial products represents about 17 percent of flexible packaging net sales. Growth in other flexible packaging markets representing a combined 17 percent of total flexible packaging net sales substantially offset the impact of these decreases. Packaging for dairy and liquid products and overwrap for bottled beverages each increased by about 11 percent. Net sales of medical device packaging increased almost 6 percent compared to 2006, despite a slowdown related to a period of manufacturing shutdown during 2007 in order to move equipment to a new facility in Northern Ireland.
Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.5 percent in 2007 from 11.2 percent in 2006. Restructuring and related activities resulted in $1.5 million of operating income in 2007 and a $29.0 million reduction in operating profit in 2006. During 2007, operating profit was negatively impacted by the lower unit sales volume noted in the previous paragraph and a steady increase in raw material costs.
Pressure Sensitive Materials Business Segment The pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets: prime and variable information labels, which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets; graphic design, used to create signage and decorations; and technical components, which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics, automotive, construction and medical industries.
Paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment. For the last several years, general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs.
In Januaryof 2006, we announced a restructuring plan which included the closure of one pressure sensitive materials plant in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency. This effort was completed by December31, 2006. Restructuring and related charges incurred for this business segment totaled $1.0 million in 2006. These costs were primarily employee-related costs and were recorded as a component of other costs (income), net.
(dollarsinmillions) 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 626.2 $ 647.5 $ 639.3 Operating profit   (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) 34.3 40.3 50.1 Operating profit   as a percentage of net sales 5.5 % 6.2 % 7.8 % 12 Table of Contents 2008 versus 2007 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of 3.3 percent in 2008, reflecting a benefit from currency translation of 2.8 percent which was more than offset by lower unit sales. Unit volumes declined in each of our pressure sensitive product lines, partially offset by increased label products prices and improved sales mix for technical products. Our label and graphic product lines represent 88 percent of our 2008 pressure sensitive materials net sales. Demand for these products in the discretionary consumer and advertising markets declined during the recent global economic downturn.
Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting decreased unit sales volumes across all product lines. Due to the nature of the markets served by this business segment, we expect operating profit as a percent of net sales to continue to decline until global economic conditions improve.
2007 versus 2006 Our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of 1.3 percent in 2007, reflecting a benefit from currency translation of 4.5 percent, substantially offset by lower unit sales for label and technical products. Increased industry capacity for label products dampened unit sales volume and pricing during 2007, resulting in a 4 percent decrease in net sales of label products, excluding the impact of currency. Technical product net sales decreased by over 8 percent as customers faced economic challenges associated with the housing and medical markets. Graphic product net sales increased by about 5 percent during 2007.
Operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting decreased sales of value-added technical products and a lower margin sales mix in our graphic product sales.
Consolidated Gross Margin (dollarsinmillions) 2008 2007 2006 Gross margin $ 648.0 $ 676.0 $ 696.7 Gross margin as   a percentage of net sales 17.1 % 18.5 % 19.1 % Restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by $0.3 million in 2007 and $12.9 million in 2006. There were no restructuring charges during 2008. The time lag between increases in raw material costs and the implementation of related selling price increases negatively impacted gross margins as a percent of net sales in each of the years presented. In addition, lower production volume associated with weak consumer demand for products in our markets reduced fixed cost absorption during 2007 and 2008. The impact of these cost pressures was partially offset by ongoing initiatives to improve production efficiency and cost management during the same timeframe.
Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (dollarsinmillions) 2008 2007 2006 Selling, general   and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 342.7 $ 341.6 $ 336.4 SG&A as a   percentage of net sales 9.1 % 9.4 % 9.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses have remained relatively stable over the past few years, reflecting managements focus on cost management. The decline in the ratio of these expenses to net sales was driven by higher selling prices included in net sales over these time periods.
Other Expenses (dollarsinmillions) 2008 2007 2006 Research and   development (R&D) $ 25.0 $ 26.0 $ 25.0 R&D as a   percentage of net sales 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.7 % Interest expense $ 39.4 $ 50.3 $ 49.3 Other costs   (income), net (27.6 ) (31.5 ) (3.3 ) Minority   interest in net income 6.0 3.7 3.5 Income taxes 96.3 104.3 109.5 Effective tax   rate 36.7 % 36.5 % 38.3 % Research and Development Our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations. Our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment, bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment. We believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products. Expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold.
Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $10.9 million during 2008, reflecting lower levels of debt outstanding and lower average interest rates. The percentage of variable rate debt included in total debt is 55 percent in 2008, 64 percent in 2007, and 59 percent in 2006. The effective interest rate was 4.8 percent in 2008, 5.9 percent in 2007, and 5.9 percent in 2006.
13 Table of Contents Other Costs (Income), Net In 2008, other costs (income) included $33.5 million of financial income, about 40 percent of which relates to interest income on cash held at non-U.S. locations. The use of cash on hand for debt reduction during the fourth quarter of 2008 is expected to result in lower interest income during 2009. The remainder of the financial income is generated from fiscal incentives for certain flexible packaging locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit. These fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in South America and are expected to continue to grow at a modest pace over the next few years in conjunction with sales growth in that region. Transaction losses on foreign currency totaling $6.8 million offset financial income in 2008. Of this total, $6.1 million of transaction losses were recorded during the fourth quarter as dramatic changes in currency exchange rates occurred as a result of the global financial crisis.
In 2007, other costs (income) included $28.3 million of financial income, about half of which related to interest income on cash held at non-U.S. locations. In 2006, other costs (income) included $18.3 million of restructuring and related charges, which were more than offset by financial income of $18.0 million and a $4.5 million favorable resolution of a litigated foreign excise tax liability.
Minority Interest in Net Income Minority interest in net income is primarily associated with the accounting for the outstanding preferred shares of Dixie Toga, our Brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary.
Income Taxes The difference between our overall tax rate of 36.7 percent in 2008, 36.5 percent in 2007, and 38.3 percent in 2006 and the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits. The lower effective tax rates in 2008 and 2007 as compared to 2006 reflect benefits related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary, the increasing impact of U.S. tax incentives for manufacturing companies, and a change in the geographic mix of pretax income.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity In the second half of 2008, global financial markets experienced a liquidity crisis. This crisis resulted in a substantial reduction in available funding for commercial banks and corporate debt issuers. Governments around the world have responded with funding support for their regional financial systems. Despite this government intervention, capital market financing has become less available and more expensive. We use commercial paper to finance our daily operations. Our strong balance sheet and short-term A-1/P-2 credit ratings have preserved our ability to access the commercial paper market at a reasonable cost. If the commercial paper market becomes unavailable to us, we would expect to use our revolving bank credit facilities to finance our operations until the commercial paper market is restored or alternative financing can be arranged.
Debt to Total Capitalization Debt to total capitalization (which includes total debt, long-term deferred tax liabilities and equity) was 32.0 percent at December31, 2008, compared to 32.9 percent at December31, 2007 and 33.0 percent at December31, 2006. Improvement in this ratio was driven by debt repayments, partially offset by reductions to stockholders equity for pension and currency translation effects. Total debt was $686.6 million, $843.3 million, and $789.8 million at year-end 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Credit Rating Our capital structure and financial practices have earned Bemis Company long-term credit ratings of A from Standard& Poors and Baa1 from Moodys Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-1 and Prime-2 for our commercial paper program from Standard& Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest.
Net Cash Flow from Operations Net cash provided by operations was $293.6 million for the year ended December31, 2008, compared to $406.2 million in 2007 and $349.0 million in 2006. During 2008, cash flow was negatively impacted by lower operating profit and higher levels of working capital compared to 2007. Working capital increases during 2008 reflect the impact of higher raw material costs on inventory and increased selling prices on accounts receivable. Net cash provided by operations in the year ended December31, 2006, was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. pension plans of $24.0 million. Contributions of $2.3 million and $1.1 million were made to our U.S. pension plans in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately $30 million to our U.S. pension plans in 2009. We expect to fund this contribution with cash provided by operations.
Available Financing In addition to using cash provided by operations, we issue commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs. At year-end, our commercial paper debt outstanding was $330.8 million. Based upon our current credit rating, we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the global financial crisis threatened to eliminate liquidity in the commercial paper market. While not anticipated, if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper, we would draw upon our existing back-up credit facility. Under the terms of our revolving credit agreements, we have the capacity to borrow up to $625 million, of which $425 million matures April28, 2013, and $200 million matures April28, 2009. These facilities are primarily used to support our issuance of commercial paper. Our revolving credit facilities are supported by a group of major U.S. and international banks. Covenants imposed by these revolving credit facilities include limits on the sale of businesses, minimum net worth calculations, and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The revolving credit agreements include a combined $100 million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries. In addition, we have arrangements in place to issue up to $100 million of Extendable Commercial Notes (ECNs), which are short-term instruments whose 14 Table of Contents maturity can be extended to 390 days from the date of issuance. As of December31, 2008, the ECN market was unavailable due to unfavorable market conditions. If these revolving credit facilities and ECNs were no longer available to us, we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market, which would increase our borrowing costs. Borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate.
Commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2008, has been classified as long-term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The related back-up credit agreement expires on April28, 2013.
On August15, 2008, notes totaling $250 million matured and were repaid using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. On December31, 2008, our revolving credit facilities supported total commercial paper outstanding of $330.8 million, industrial revenue bond outstanding of $8.0 million, and multicurrency loans outstanding of $5.8 million. As a result, we had the capacity to borrow an additional $280.4 million under the credit facility as of December31, 2008. Of this available liquidity, $200 million of revolving credit facilities mature on April28, 2009. While cash flows from operations are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash obligations projected for 2009, we will continue to evaluate the need to refinance this excess revolving credit capacity in light of existing capital market conditions and updated liquidity needs.
Liquidity Outlook Management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward. Our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment or the recent economic slowdown, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by ongoing capital market disruptions. In addition, substantial increases in raw material costs could increase our short term liquidity needs.
Uses of Liquidity Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $120.5 million during 2008, compared to $178.9 million in 2007, and $158.8 million in 2006. Capital expenditures during the years presented supported multiyear investments for new facilities and equipment for the medical and pharmaceutical markets, a platform for rigid polyester packaging products, additional converting equipment in our Malaysian operation, proprietary film production capacity for European markets, and a new enterprise resource planning system. Capital expenditures for 2009 are estimated to be approximately $105 million. Over the long-term, we expect average annual capital expenditures to be approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses. We expect to fund 2009 capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities.
Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 4.8 percent during the first quarter of 2008 to 22 cents per share from 21 cents per share. This follows increases of 10.5 percent in 2007 and 5.6 percent in 2006. In February2009, the Board of Directors approved the 26 th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 22.5 cents per share, a 2.3 percent increase.
Share Repurchases During 2008, we purchased 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market. During 2007, we purchased 5.15 million shares of common stock, of which 4.0 million shares were repurchased in conjunction with an accelerated share repurchase program. The remaining 1.15 million shares were purchased in the open market. During 2006, we purchased 0.6 million shares of common stock in the open market. As of December31, 2008, we were authorized to purchase up to 4.1 million additional shares of common stock for the treasury.
Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, and certain other purchase obligations as of December31, 2008.
Contractual Payments Due by Period Lessthan 1to3 3to5 Morethan (inmillions) Total 1year years years 5years Debt payments   (1) $ 686.6 $ 26.6 $ 21.1 $ 638.9 $ 0.0 Interest expense   (2) 91.9 26.8 49.8 15.3 0.0 Capital leases   (3) 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Operating leases   (4) 25.6 6.8 8.6 4.5 5.8 Purchase   obligations (5) 149.1 146.8 1.4 0.1 0.8 Postretirement   obligations (6) 53.0 4.4 15.9 12.6 20.1 Pursuant to the application of FIN 48, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments. See Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(1) These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on April28, 2013.
(2) A portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates. The amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at December31, 2008.
15 Table of Contents (3) Amount noted also includes estimated interest costs. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations.
(4) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements.
(5) Purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials, utilities, capital equipment and various other goods and services.
(6) Postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded Bemis Supplemental Retirement Plan. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations.
Interest Rate Swaps As of December31, 2007, our long-term unsecured notes included $250 million due in August2008. In September2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two U.S. banks, which increased our exposure to variable rates. We generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term. These interest rate swap agreements, which expired on the date the related notes matured in August2008, reduced the interest cost of the notes from 6.5 percent to about 6.0 percent in 2008 and 6.0 percent in 2007. Since these variable rates are based upon six-month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), calculated in arrears, at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) require that the fair value of these swaps, which were designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding, be recorded as an asset or liability of the Company. The fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of $3.3 million at December31, 2007. An offsetting increase was recorded in the fair value of the related long-term notes outstanding. This fair value adjustment did not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes, nor did it impact the income statement or related cash flows.
Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. Our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates, establish rates for future issuance of public notes, and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates.
Interest expense on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short-term interest rates. As such, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. For each one percent increase in variable interest rates, the annual interest expense on $380.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by $3.8 million.
Our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. At December31, 2008 and 2007, we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $1.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months. Counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability.
Our business in Brazil holds U.S. dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the Brazilian real. In order to hedge this exposure, we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt, effectively converting a portion of the U.S. denominated debt to the local currency. We have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December31, 2008 and 2007, we had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $24.6 million and $49.6 million, respectively. The net settlement amounts (fair value) related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as part of the underlying debt and as an expense element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and were not significant at December31, 2008 and 2007.
The operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes. The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of $60.5 million in 2008 and $123.2 million in 2007. Operating profit improved by approximately $5.9 million in 2008 and $9.6 million in 2007 as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation.
Stockholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts. The impact of currency translation during 2008 was a reduction in stockholders equity totaling $183.2 million.
16 Table of Contents The majority of our pension liabilities are funded with assets that are invested in equity and fixed income securities whose market values are readily available from published market sources. During 2008, the market value of these assets declined in conjunction with the global economic downturn. This decline in market value is the principal reason that pension expense in 2009 is expected to increase by approximately $9.7 million. As of December31, 2008, the unfunded portion of our pension liabilities increased by $164.1 million compared to the balance as of December31, 2007. The after-tax impact of this increased liability is a charge to other comprehensive income of $99.5 million, which is reflected as reduction in stockholders equity at December31, 2008.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
The calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities; and  The valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill.
Accounting for pension costs We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with FAS No.87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , as amended by FAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans , which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. FAS No.158 requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet. A substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the United States.
Net periodic pension costs recorded in 2008 was $10.5 million, compared to pension cost of $15.2 million in 2007 and $17.7 million in 2006. Effective January1, 2006, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two-thirds of the participant population. For those employees impacted, future pension benefits were replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the Company. As a result, future pension liability is no longer adjusted for additional years of service for those employees impacted by the amendment and the related service cost and pension expense have decreased.
One element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rulesis the expected return on plan assets. As of January1, 2008, in conjunction with a change in the allocation of the U.S. pension assets to equity investments from 80 percent to 70 percent of total assets, we reduced our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to 8.50 percent. For the years 2006 and 2007, we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of 80 percent of total assets and had assumed that the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would be 8.75 percent.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation. Using historical long-term investment periods of 10, 15, 20 and 25 years ending December31, 2008, our pension plan assets have earned annualized rates of return of 0.5 percent, 6.4 percent, 7.7 percent, and 8.9 percent, respectively. This is a substantial decline from the annualized long-term investment returns as of December31, 2007 of 6.3 percent, 9.0 percent, 9.8 percent and 10.5 percent. This decline reflects substantially lower investment market values on U.S. pension assets during 2008. Considering these long-term results, we further reduced our expected return on assets assumption to 8.25 percent as of January1, 2009. Using our target asset allocation of plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long-term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable.
This assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years. This process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods. The net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and, ultimately, future pension income and expense.
At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to changes in rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. At December31, 2008, for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be 6.00 percent, a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the 6.25 percent rate used at December31, 2007.
17 Table of Contents Pension assumptions sensitivity analysis Based upon current assumptions of 6.00 percent for the discount rate and 8.25 percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for 2009 to be in a range of $18 million to $23 million. The following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated 2009 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on assets.

The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate.

Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets. We review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows. Goodwill was $595.5 million as of December31, 2008.
Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, and tradenames and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 30 years, when purchased. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable. The test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. These estimates and projections require judgments as to future events, condition and amounts of future cash flows.
New Accounting Pronouncements In December2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position (FSP) No.FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)), which provides guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP FAS 132(R)on our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan note disclosures.
In June2008, the FASB issued FSP No.EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1), which clarified that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities, and thus, should be included in the two-class method of computing earnings per share (EPS). As discussed in Note 7, nonforfeitable dividend equivalent payments are made during the grant period on outstanding, unvested performance units. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning 18 Table of Contents after December15, 2008, and interim periods within those years, and requires that all prior period EPS data be adjusted retroactively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP EITF 03-6-1 on our calculation and disclosure of basic and diluted EPS.
In April2008, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142-3), which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. As this guidance applies only to assets we may acquire in the future, we are not able to predict the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
In March2008, the FASB issued FAS No.161, The Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about (a)how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b)how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and (c)how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008. For the Company, FAS No.161 will be effective at the beginning of its 2009 fiscal year and will result in additional disclosures in notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In December2007, the FASB issued FAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No.51 (FAS 160), which amends ARB No.51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The standard is effective for the Company on January1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 160 on our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
In December2007, the FASB issued FAS No.141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R)establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The new standard also requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. FAS 141(R)is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. Accordingly, any business combination we enter into and/or close after December31, 2008, will be subject to this new standard. Beginning January1, 2009, the Company will expense all acquisition-related costs as incurred as well as any capitalized costs related to business combinations that were in process, but not completed by the effective date of FAS 141(R).
In February2007, the FASB issued FAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 (FAS 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The standard was effective for the Company on January1, 2008 and, as permitted, the Company has not elected the fair value option for its financial assets and financial liabilities.
In September2006, the FASB issued FAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 will apply whenever another standard requires (or permits) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances. In early 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 157-2, which delays by one year the effective date of FAS 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis. The Company adopted FAS 157 on January1, 2008, as required, with no effect on the measurement of the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities or on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. We are continuing to evaluate the impact the standard will have on the determination of fair value related to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities in years after 2008.
Forward-looking Statements This Annual Report contains certain estimates, predictions, and other forward-looking statements (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Forward-looking statements are generally identified with the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, target, may, will, plan, project, should, continue, or the negative thereof or other similar expressions, or discussion of future goals or aspirations, which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters. Such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance (financial and otherwise), including those of acquired companies, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
19 Table of Contents Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions caused by inflation, interest rates, consumer confidence, rates of unemployment and foreign currency exchange rates; investment performance of assets in our pension plans; competitive conditions within our markets, including the acceptance of our new and existing products; threats or challenges to our patented or proprietary technologies; raw material costs and availability, particularly for polymer resins and adhesives; the magnitude and volatility of price changes for raw materials and our ability to pass these price changes on to our customers in selling prices or otherwise manage commodity price fluctuation risks; changes in the availability of financing; the presence of adequate cash available for investment in our business in order to maintain desired debt levels; unexpected costs or manufacturing issues related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource system; changes in governmental regulation, especially in the areas of environmental, health and safety matters, and foreign investment; unexpected outcomes in our current and future litigation proceedings and any related proceedings or civil lawsuits; unexpected outcomes in our current and future domestic and international tax proceedings; changes in our labor relations; and the impact of changes in the world political environment including threatened or actual armed conflict. These and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form10-K and our quarterly reports on Form10-Q, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In addition, actual future results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement as a result of changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statement.
ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item 7A is included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K, and under the caption Market Risks and Foreign Currency Exposures which is part of Managements Discussion and Analysis included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10 percent adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange, currency swaps, and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.

The financial statements are prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and using managements best estimates and judgments, where appropriate. The financial information presented throughout this Annual Report on Form10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.
The management of Bemis Company,Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f). Under the direction, supervision, and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Companys management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO-Framework).

Henry   J. Theisen Gene   C. Wulf Stanley   A. Jaffy President   and Senior   Vice President and Vice   President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer Controller 20 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors of Bemis Company,Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders equity and of cash flow present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bemis Company,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A in this Annual Report. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, effective December31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No, 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.
As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

25 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1  BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of the business: Bemis Company,Inc., a Missouri corporation, was founded in 1858 and incorporated in 1885 as Bemis Bro. Bag Company. In 1965 the name was changed to Bemis Company,Inc. (the Company). Based in Neenah, Wisconsin, the Company employs approximately 15,400 individuals and has 57 manufacturing facilities located in the United States and ten other countries. The Company manufactures and sells flexible packaging products and pressure sensitive materials throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
The Companys business activities are organized around its two business segments, Flexible Packaging, which accounted for approximately 83 percent of 2008 net sales, and Pressure Sensitive Materials, which accounted for the remaining net sales. The Companys flexible packaging business has a strong technical base in polymer chemistry, film extrusion, coating, laminating, printing, and converting. The Companys pressure sensitive materials business specializes in adhesive technologies. The primary markets for the Companys products are in the food industry, which accounted for approximately 60 percent of 2008 net sales. The Companys flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store. Other markets include chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care products, electronics, automotive, construction, graphic industries, and other consumer goods. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality, and service.
Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Joint ventures which are not majority controlled are accounted for by the equity method of accounting with earnings of $919,000, $933,000, and $32,000 in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, included in other costs (income), net, on the accompanying consolidated statement of income. Investments in joint ventures are included in deferred charges and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Certain prior year amounts have been restated to conform to current year presentation.
Estimates and assumptions required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Translation of foreign currencies: The Company considers the local currency to be the reporting currency for all foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. All revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. Translation gains or losses are recorded in the foreign currency translation component in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $(6,755,000) $2,445,000, and $(849,000), in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, are included as a component of other costs (income), net.
Revenue recognition: Sales and related costs of sales are recognized upon shipment of products or when all of the conditions of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No.104 are fulfilled. All costs associated with revenue, including customer volume discounts, are recognized at the time of sale. Customer volume discounts are accrued in accordance with EITF No.01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer and recorded as a reduction to sales. Shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of costs of sales while amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as a component of sales. The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs when specific issues are identified and the amounts are determinable.
Environmental cost: The Company is involved in a number of environmental related disputes and claims. The Company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. At December31, 2008 and 2007, reserves were $401,000 and $588,000, respectively. Adjustments to the reserve accounts and costs which were directly expensed for environmental remediation matters resulted in charges to the income statements for 2008, 2007, and 2006 of $306,000, $111,000, and $128,000, net of third party reimbursements totaling $0, $0, and $102,000, for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Earnings per share: Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year and dilutive shares relating to stock incentive plans. The following table presents information necessary to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share: (inthousands,exceptpershareamounts) 2008 2007 2006 Weighted average   common shares outstanding  basic 99,777 102,992 104,865 Dilutive shares 1,192 1,122 1,902 Weighted average   common and common equivalent shares outstanding  diluted 100,969 104,114 106,767 Net income for   basic and diluted earnings per share computation $ 166,214 $ 181,554 $ 176,296 Earnings per   common share  basic $ 1.67 $ 1.76 $ 1.68 Earnings per   common share  diluted $ 1.65 $ 1.74 $ 1.65 Certain options outstanding at December31, 2008 (410,720 shares) were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share above because they would not have had a dilutive effect.
Research and development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.
26 Table of Contents Taxes on undistributed earnings: No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiary companies which the Company controls but does not include in the consolidated federal income tax return as it is managements practice and intent to indefinitely reinvest the earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid temporary investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposit that can be readily liquidated without penalty at the Companys option. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair market value.
Accounts receivable: Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The following factors are considered when determining the collectibility of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experience, current economic industry trends, and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on managements assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,262,000 and $19,311,000 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Inventory valuation: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market. Inventories are summarized at December31, as follows: (inthousands) 2008 2007 Raw materials   and supplies $ 161,451 $ 169,687 Work in process   and finished goods 293,132 328,758 Total   inventories, gross 454,583 498,445 Less inventory   write-downs (18,916 ) (19,718 ) Total   inventories, net $ 435,667 $ 478,727 Property and equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred. Plant and equipment are depreciated for financial reporting purposes principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets as follows: land improvements, 15-30 years; buildings, 15-45 years; leasehold and building improvements, the lesser of the lease term or 8-20 years; and machinery and equipment, 3-16 years. For tax purposes, the Company generally uses accelerated methods of depreciation. The tax effect of the difference between book and tax depreciation has been provided as deferred income taxes. Depreciation expense was $152,962,000, $149,852,000, and $144,058,000 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. On sale or retirement, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reflected in income. Interest costs which are capitalized during the construction of major capital projects totaled $2,557,000 in 2008, $4,220,000 in 2007, and $2,871,000 in 2006.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value.
The Company capitalizes direct costs (internal and external) of materials and services used in the development and purchase of internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three to seven years and are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within property and equipment.
The Company is in the process of configuring and developing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Certain costs incurred during the application development stage are being capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use . These costs will be amortized over the systems estimated useful life and amortization will begin as the ERP system is placed in service.
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Effective January1, 2002, the Company adopted the reporting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No.141, Business Combinations, and FAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and as required, has applied its requirements to acquisitions made after June30, 2001. In accordance with FAS No.142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or whenever there is an impairment indicator, using a fair-value based approach.
Intangible assets: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are being amortized against income using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, with original periods ranging from one to 30 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever there is an impairment indicator. Intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations to net book value.
Financial instruments: The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair 27 Table of Contents value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized. Gains or losses, if any, related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized through earnings in the current period. Note 14 contains expanded details relating to specific derivative instruments included on the Companys balance sheet, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency swap contracts, and interest rate swap arrangements.
Treasury stock: Repurchased common stock is stated at cost and is presented as a separate reduction of stockholders equity. At December31, 2008, 4.1 million common shares can be repurchased, at managements discretion, under authority granted by the Companys Board of Directors in 2008.
Preferred stock purchase rights: On July29, 1999, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan by declaring a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock. Under certain circumstances, a right may be exercised to purchase one four-hundredth of a share of SeriesA Junior Preferred Stock for $60, subject to adjustment. The rights become exercisable if, subject to certain exceptions, a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock or announces an offer which would result in such person acquiring beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock. If a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions, each right will entitle its holder to buy from the Company, common stock of the Company having a market value of twice the exercise price of the right. The rights expire August23, 2009, and may be redeemed by the Company for $.001 per right at any time before a person becomes a beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock. The Companys Board of Directors has designated 600,000 shares of SeriesA Junior Preferred Stock with a par value of $1 per share that relate to the Shareholder Rights Plan. At December31, 2008, none of these shares were issued or outstanding.
Note 2  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position (FSP) No.FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)), which provides guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP FAS 132(R)on our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan note disclosures.
In June2008, the FASB issued FSP No.EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1), which clarified that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities, and thus, should be included in the two-class method of computing earnings per share (EPS). As discussed in Note 7, nonforfeitable dividend equivalent payments are made during the grant period on outstanding, unvested performance units. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within those years, and requires that all prior period EPS data be adjusted retroactively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FSP EITF 03-6-1 on our calculation and disclosure of basic and diluted EPS.
In April2008, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142-3), which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. As this guidance applies only to assets we may acquire in the future, we are not able to predict the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
In March2008, the FASB issued FAS No.161, The Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about (a)how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b)how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and (c)how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008. For the Company, FAS No.161 will be effective at the beginning of its 2009 fiscal year and will result in additional disclosures in notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In December2007, the FASB issued FAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No.51 (FAS 160), which amends ARB No.51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The standard is effective for the Company on January1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 160 on our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
In December2007, the FASB issued FAS No.141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R)establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The new standard also requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. FAS 141(R)is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. Accordingly, any business combination we enter into and/or close after December31, 2008, will be subject to this new standard. Beginning January1, 2009, the Company will expense all acquisition-related costs as incurred as well as any capitalized costs related to business combinations that were in process, but not completed by the effective date of FAS 141(R).
28 Table of Contents In February2007, the FASB issued FAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 (FAS 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The standard was effective for the Company on January1, 2008 and, as permitted, the Company has not elected the fair value option for its financial assets and financial liabilities.
In September2006, the FASB issued FAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 will apply whenever another standard requires (or permits) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances. In early 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 157-2, which delays by one year the effective date of FAS 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis. The Company adopted FAS 157 on January1, 2008, as required, with no effect on the measurement of the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities or on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. We are continuing to evaluate the impact the standard will have on the determination of fair value related to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities in years after 2008.
Note 3  FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE The fair values of the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The fair values are based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The financial assets and financial liabilities are primarily valued using standard calculations / models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are the primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes.

Estimated annual amortization expense is $9.7 million for 2009 and 2010, $9.5 million for 2011, $8.0 million for 2012, and $6.9 million for 2013. The Company completed its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2008 with no indications of impairment of goodwill found.
Note 5  PENSION PLANS Total multiemployer plan, defined contribution, and defined benefit pension expense in 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $16,909,000, $26,311,000, and $28,942,000, respectively. In addition to these plans, the Company also sponsors a 401(k)savings plan for substantially all U.S. employees. The Company contributes $0.50 for every pre-tax $1.00 an employee contributes on the first two percent of eligible compensation plus $0.25 for every pre-tax $1.00 an employee contributes on the next six percent of eligible compensation. Company contributions are invested in Company stock and are fully vested after three years of service. Total Company contributions for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $6,417,000, $5,993,000, and $5,830,000, respectively.
29 Table of Contents Effective January1, 2006, our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two-thirds of the participant population. For those employees impacted, future pension benefits were replaced with the Bemis Investment Profit Sharing Plan (BIPSP), a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the Company. Total contribution expense for BIPSP and previously existing defined contribution plans was $5,661,000 in 2008, $10,394,000 in 2007, and $10,551,000 in 2006. Multiemployer plans cover employees at two different manufacturing locations and provide for contributions to a union administered defined benefit pension plan. Amounts charged to pension cost and contributed to the multiemployer plans in 2008, 2007, and 2006 totaled $780,000, $749,000, and $740,000, respectively.
The Companys defined benefit pension plans continue to cover a substantial number of U.S. employees, and the non-U.S. defined benefit plans cover select employees at various international locations. The benefits under the plans are based on years of service and salary levels. Certain plans covering hourly employees provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. In addition, the Company also sponsors an unfunded supplemental retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of limits under the federal tax law and increased benefits to reflect a service adjustment factor.
Effective December31, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  An Amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) (FAS 158). As a result of the adoption of FAS 158, the Company has recorded a cumulative effect adjustment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity (also see Note 6). The Companys disclosures for the fiscal year ended 2006 also reflected the revised accounting and disclosure requirements of FAS 158. Reported items for fiscal year 2005 were not affected.
The adoption of FAS 158 on December31, 2006, resulted in incremental adjustments to the following individual line items in the consolidated balance sheet: Before After Applicationof Applicationof (inthousands) FAS158 Adjustments FAS158 Deferred charges   and other assets $ 188,748 $ (125,224 ) $ 63,524 Total assets 3,164,233 (125,224 ) 3,039,009 Deferred taxes 189,244 (55,076 ) 134,168 Other   liabilities and deferred credits 107,396 18,578 125,974 Total   stockholders equity 1,560,742 (88,726 ) 1,472,016 Total   liabilities and stockholders equity 3,164,233 (125,224 ) 3,039,009 Net periodic pension cost for defined benefit plans included the following components for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006: (inthousands) 2008 2007 2006 Service cost -   benefits earned during the year $ 13,109 $ 13,868 $ 14,572 Interest cost on   projected benefit obligation 34,217 32,497 30,726 Expected return   on plan assets (44,233 ) (45,274 ) (41,626 ) Settlement   (gain) loss 29 3,726 Curtailment 667 Amortization of   unrecognized transition obligation 261 240 158 Amortization of   prior service cost 2,355 2,290 2,352 Recognized   actuarial net (gain) or loss 4,730 7,820 10,802 Net periodic   pension (income) cost $ 10,468 $ 15,167 $ 17,651 Changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, and a reconciliation of the funded status at December31, 2008 and 2007, are as follows: U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans (inthousands) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Change   in Benefit Obligation: Benefit   obligation at the beginning of the year $ 500,152 $ 510,663 $ 68,009 $ 75,046 Service cost 9,844 10,346 3,265 3,522 Interest cost 30,507 28,633 3,710 3,864 Participant   contributions 634 652 Plan amendments 76 114 418 Plan   curtailments (418 ) Plan settlements (1,139 ) Acquisitions 2,555 Benefits paid (23,077 ) (22,386 ) (2,559 ) (13,533 ) Actuarial (gain)   or loss 277 (27,218 ) (4,916 ) (6,117 ) Foreign currency   exchange rate changes (11,402 ) 5,714 Benefit   obligation at the end of the year $ 517,779 $ 500,152 $ 59,296 $ 68,009 Accumulated   benefit obligation at the end of the year $ 480,525 $ 448,679 $ 47,421 $ 54,534 ChangeinPlanAssets: Fair value of   plan assets at the beginning of the year $ 481,889 $ 484,567 $ 53,937 $ 56,541 Actual return on   plan assets (123,041 ) 18,594 (2,834 ) 2,258 Employer   contributions 2,271 1,114 3,450 3,973 Participant   contributions 635 652 Plan settlements (29 ) Benefits paid (23,076 ) (22,386 ) (2,559 ) (13,533 ) Foreign currency   exchange rate changes (10,027 ) 4,046 Fair value of   plan assets at the end of the year $ 338,043 $ 481,889 $ 42,573 $ 53,937 Funded   (unfunded) status at year end: $ (179,736 ) $ (18,263 ) $ (16,724 ) $ (14,072 ) Amount   recognized in consolidated balance sheet consists of: Prepaid benefit   cost, non-current $ $ 21,407 $ $ 124 Accrued benefit   liability, current (3,383 ) (1,944 ) (276 ) (162 ) Accrued benefit   liability, non-current (176,353 ) (37,726 ) (16,448 ) (14,034 ) Sub-total (179,736 ) (18,263 ) (16,724 ) (14,072 ) Deferred tax   asset 104,371 47,248 2,506 2,726 Accumulated   other comprehensive income 180,173 79,934 4,327 4,611 Net amount   recognized in consolidated balance sheet $ 104,808 $ 108,919 $ (9,891 ) $ (6,735 ) 30 Table of Contents Accumulated other comprehensive income related to pension benefit plans is as follows: U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans (inthousands) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Unrecognized net   actuarial losses $ 274,230 $ 114,655 $ 3,412 $ 3,317 Unrecognized net   prior service costs (benefits) 10,314 12,527 709 889 Unrecognized net   transition costs 2,712 3,131 Tax expense   (benefit) (104,371 ) (47,248 ) (2,506 ) (2,726 ) Accumulated   other comprehensive loss (income), end of year $ 180,173 $ 79,934 $ 4,327 $ 4,611 Estimated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be reclassified to net period cost during 2009 are as follows: Non-U.S.

The employer contributions for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, were $5,722,000 and $5,087,000, respectively. The expected cash contribution for 2009 is $36,567,000 which is expected to satisfy plan funding requirements and regulatory funding requirements.
For each of the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, the U.S. pension plans represented approximately 89 percent of the Companys total plan assets and approximately 89 percent of the Companys total projected benefit obligation. Considering the significance of the U.S. pension plans in comparison with the Companys total pension plans, we separately present and discuss the critical pension assumptions related to the U.S. pension plans and the non-U.S. pension plans.
31 Table of Contents The Companys actuarial valuation date is December31. The weighted-average discount rates and rates of increase in future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the years ended December31 are as follows: U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans 2008 2007 2008 2007 Weighted-average   discount rate 6.00 % 6.25 % 5.80 % 5.62 % Rate of increase   in future compensation levels 4.25 % 4.75 % 3.90 % 4.06 % The weighted-average discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and rates of increase in future compensation levels used to determine the net benefit cost for the years ended December31 are as follows: U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Weighted-average   discount rate 6.25 % 5.75 % 5.50 % 5.60 % 4.81 % 4.53 % Expected return   on plan assets 8.50 % 8.75 % 8.75 % 6.18 % 6.44 % 6.56 % Rate of increase   in future compensation levels 4.75 % 4.75 % 4.75 % 3.98 % 3.83 % 4.12 % The weighted-average plan asset allocation at December31, 2008, and 2007, and target allocation for 2009, are as follows: U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans 2009 Percentage 2009 Percentage Target ofPlanAssets Target ofPlanAssets AssetCategory Allocation 2008 2007 Allocation 2008 2007 Equity   Securities 70 % 58 % 76 % 27 % 28 % 41 % Debt Securities 30 % 42 % 20 % 27 % 25 % 24 % Other 4 % 46 % 47 % 35 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid: (inthousands) U.S.PensionPlans Non-U.S.PensionPlans 2009 $ 26,867 $ 1,005 2010 28,740 3,206 2011 36,063 3,050 2012 32,826 1,339 2013 34,173 3,726 Years 2014-2018 179,858 24,814 As of January1, 2009, we have assumed that the expected long-term annual rate of return on plan assets will be 8.25 percent. This is a decrease from the 8.50 percent level assumed for 2008. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered historical returns and future expectations. Using historical long-term investment periods of 10, 15, 20, and 25 years ending December31, 2008, our pension plan assets have earned annualized rates of return of 0.5 percent, 6.4 percent, 7.7 percent, and 8.9 percent, respectively. Using our target asset allocation for plan assets of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities, our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long-term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable.
At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. This discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on high quality, fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. For the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, we determined this rate to be 6.00 percent and 6.25 percent, respectively.
For our non-U.S. pension plans we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates, to be used in our actuarial calculations for the pension plans offered in each individual country. We tailor each of these assumptions in accordance with the historical market performance and prevailing market expectations for each respective country. As a result, each pension plan contains unique assumptions, which reflect the general market environment within each respective country, and are often quite different from the corresponding assumptions applied to our U.S. pension plans.
Note 6  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS The Company sponsors several defined postretirement benefit plans that cover a majority of salaried and a portion of nonunion hourly employees. These plans provide health care benefits and, in some instances, provide life insurance benefits. Except for one closed-group plan, which is noncontributory, postretirement health care plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans are noncontributory.

The expected contribution for 2009 is $978,000 which is expected to satisfy plan funding requirements.
The health care cost trend rate assumption affects the amounts reported. For measurement purposes, the assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was 8.0 percent for 2008 and was 7.0 percent for 2007; each years estimated rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0 percent and remain at that level thereafter. The annual incremental decrease was assumed to be one-half percent for 2008 and one percent for 2007. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care trends would have the following effects: (inthousands) OnePercentage PointIncrease OnePercentage PointDecrease Effect on total   of service and interest cost components for 2008 $ 19 $ (17 ) Effect on   postretirement benefit obligation at December31, 2008 $ 239 $ (217 ) The Companys actuarial valuation date is December31. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the net postretirement projected benefit obligation for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007 are 6.00 percent and 6.25 percent, respectively. The weighted-average discount rates used to determine the net postretirement benefit cost was 6.25 percent, 5.75 percent, and 5.75 percent for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Note 7  STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS Since 1987, the Companys stock option and stock award plans have provided for the issuance of up to 19,800,000 shares of common stock to key employees. As of December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, 5,915,585, 6,146,961, and 7,389,928, shares were available for future grants under these plans. Shares forfeited by the employee become available for future grants.
Stock option awards have not been granted since 2003 and all stock options outstanding at December31, 2008, are fully vested. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Stock options were granted at prices equal to fair market value on the date of the grant and are exercisable, upon vesting, over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant. Options for directors vest immediately, while options for Company employees generally vest over three years (one-third per year). Details of the stock option plans at December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, are: Aggregate PerShare Weighted-Average Intrinsic Numberof OptionPrice ExercisePrice Value Shares Range PerShare Outstanding at   December31, 2005 2,153,378 $15.86 -$26.95 $ 19.72 Exercised in   2006 $ 1,870,000 (132,200 ) $16.16 -$22.04 $ 16.64 Outstanding at   December31, 2006 $ 28,269,000 2,021,178 $15.86 -$26.95 $ 19.92 Exercisable at   December31, 2006 $ 27,884,000 1,979,178 $15.86 -$26.95 $ 19.82 Exercised in   2007 $ 3,494,000 (337,096 ) $18.67 -$22.52 $ 22.10 Outstanding at   December31, 2007 $ 13,238,000 1,684,082 $15.86 -$26.95 $ 19.49 Exercisable at   December31, 2007 $ 13,238,000 1,684,082 $15.86 -$26.95 $ 19.49 Exercised in   2008 $ 2,385,000 (287,346 ) $15.88 -$18.81 $ 18.45 Forfeited in   2008 $ 46,000 (7,398 ) $18.81 $ 18.81 Outstanding at   December31, 2008 $ 5,467,000 1,389,338 $15.86 -$26.95 $ 19.75 Exercisable at   December31, 2008 $ 5,467,000 1,389,338 $15.86 -$26.95 $ 19.75 The following table summarizes information about outstanding and exercisable stock options at December31, 2008.

The 1994, 2001, and 2007 (adopted in 2006) Plans provide for the issuance of up to 4,000,000, 5,000,000, and 6,000,000 grants, respectively. Each Plan expires 10 years after its inception, at which point no further stock options or performance units may be granted. Since 1994, 3,932,910, 3,677,162, and 1,474,343 grants of either stock options or performance units (commonly referred to as restricted stock) have been made under the 1994, 2001, and 2007 Plans, respectively. Distribution of the performance units is made in the form of shares of the Companys common stock on a one for one basis. Distribution of the shares will normally be made not less than three years, nor more than six years, from the date of the performance unit grant. All performance units granted under the plan are subject to restrictions as to continuous employment, except in the case of death, permanent disability, or retirement. In addition, cash payments are made during the grant period on outstanding performance units equal to the dividend on Bemis common stock. The cost of the award is based on the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The cost of the awards is charged to income over the requisite service period.
34 Table of Contents Total compensation expense related to Stock Incentive Plans was $18,058,000 in 2008, $16,849,000 in 2007, and $11,694,000 in 2006.
As of December31, 2008, the unrecorded compensation cost for performance units is $40,445,000 and will be recognized over the remaining vesting period for each grant which ranges between January1, 2009 and October5, 2013. The remaining weighted-average life of all performance units outstanding is 2.3 years. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R)the Company maintained liability balances of $37,629,000 related to the portion of performance units for which compensation expense had been previously recognized. As these awards are considered equity-based awards under FAS 123(R), the Company has reclassified this balance from a liability classification to a component of additional paid-in capital.
The following table summarizes annual restricted stock unit activity for the three years ended December31, 2008: 2008 2007 2006 Outstanding   shares granted at the beginning of the year 3,296,583 3,200,437 3,069,163 Shares Granted 318,441 1,302,800 346,143 Shares Paid (182,943 ) (1,146,821 ) (142,869 ) Shares Canceled (89,667 ) (59,833 ) (72,000 ) Outstanding   shares granted at the end of the year 3,342,414 3,296,583 3,200,437 Aggregate   intrinsic value at year end of outstanding awards $ 79,148,000 $ 90,260,000 $ 108,751,000 Note 8  LONG-TERM DEBT Debt consisted of the following at December31, (dollarsinthousands) 2008 2007 Commercial paper   payable through 2009 at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.9% $ 330,795 $ 161,500 Notes payable in   2008 at an interest rate of 6.5% 250,000 Notes payable in   2012 at an interest rate of 4.9% 300,000 300,000 Interest rate   swap (fair market value) 3,347 Industrial   revenue bond payable through 2012 at an interest rate of 1.6% 8,000 8,000 Debt of   subsidiary companies payable through 2012 at interest rates of 5.4% to 11.3% 39,775 54,221 Obligations   under capital leases 65 146 Total debt 678,635 777,214 Less current   portion 18,651 1,758 Total long-term   debt $ 659,984 $ 775,456 The commercial paper and the $250 million note payable, which matured in 2008, have been classified as long-term debt, to the extent of available long-term backup credit agreements, in accordance with the Companys intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. The weighted-average interest rate of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2008, was 2.9 percent. The maximum outstanding during 2008 was $476,052,000, and the average outstanding during 2008 was $290,211,536. The weighted-average interest rate during 2008 was 3.2 percent.
The industrial revenue bond has a variable interest rate which is determined weekly by a Remarketing Agent based on similar debt then available. The interest rate at December31, 2008, was 1.6 percent and the weighted-average interest rate during 2008 was 2.6 percent. Long-term debt maturing in years 2009 through 2013 is $18,651,000, $20,763,000, $368,000, $308,058,000, and $330,795,000, respectively. The Company is in compliance with all debt covenant agreements.
Under the terms of our revolving credit agreements, we have the capacity to borrow up to $625 million, of which $425 million matures April28, 2013, and $200 million matures April28, 2009. These facilities are primarily used to support our issuance of commercial paper. The revolving credit agreements include a combined $100 million multicurrency limit to support to financing needs of our international subsidiaries. In addition, we have arrangements in place to issue up to $100 million of Extendable Commercial Notes (ECNs), which are short-term instruments whose maturity can be extended to 390 days from the date of issuance. As of December31, 2008, the ECN market was unavailable due to unfavorable market conditions.
The Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $250.0 million in the third quarter of 2001, effectively converting a portion of the Companys fixed interest rate exposure to a variable rate basis to hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. During 2008 these swaps matured and were net settled, concurrent with the repayment of the underlying $250.0 million debt. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap agreements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as interest rates change. The interest rate swap agreements as of December31, 2007, were designated as hedges of the fair value of the Companys fixed rate long-term debt obligation of $250.0 million, 6.5 percent notes due August15, 2008.
The variable rate for each of the interest rate swaps was based on the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), set in arrears, plus a fixed spread. The variable rates were reset semi-annually at each net settlement date. The net settlement benefit to the 35 Table of Contents Company, which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense, was $5.7 million, $1.3 million, and $0.4 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. At December31, 2007, the fair value of these interest rate swaps was $3.3 million in the Companys favor, as determined by the respective counterparties using discounted cash flow or other appropriate methodologies, and is included with deferred charges and other assets with a corresponding increase in long-term debt.
Note 9  RESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS In January2006, the Company committed to a plan to close five flexible packaging plants: Peoria, Illinois; Denmark and Neenah, Wisconsin; Georgetown, Ontario, Canada; and Epernon, France. The closure of these plants, together with related support staff and capacity reductions within the flexible packaging business segment, has reduced fixed costs and improved capacity utilization elsewhere in the Company. During 2006, the Company incurred charges of $11.6 million for employee severance, $12.3 million for accelerated depreciation, and $5.1 million for other related costs. The restructuring effort is complete.
Also in January2006, the Company committed to a plan to close a pressure sensitive materials plant located in Hopkins, Minnesota. The closure of this plant, together with related support staff and capacity reductions within the pressure sensitive materials business segment, has reduced fixed costs and improved capacity utilization. During 2006, the Company incurred charges of $0.5 million for employee severance and $0.5 million for other related costs. The restructuring effort is complete.
During 2006, a total of $18.3 million has been charged to other costs (income) and $12.9 million has been charged to cost of products sold within the consolidated statement of income. During 2007, a total of $0.3 million restructuring income has been recorded as a component of other costs (income) and $0.3 million has been charged to cost of products sold within the consolidated statement of income. Included in the amount recorded in other costs (income) was a $1.5 million charge associated with corporate restructuring and related costs, which was more than offset by net restructuring income of $1.8 million related to our flexible packing operations.

Approximately $16.7 million of the carryover expires over the period 2014-2018. The balance of the loss carryovers has no expiration. FASNo.109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Companys management determined that a valuation allowance of $9.2 million against deferred tax assets primarily associated with the foreign net operating loss carryover was necessary at December31, 2008.
Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on $163.7 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings.
The Company adopted FAS Interpretation (FIN) No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), on January1, 2007. The Company recognized no material adjustments as a result of the implementation of this policy.
As of December31, 2007, the Company had approximately $9.1 million of total unrecognized tax benefits. Of this total, approximately $6.4 million represented the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective income tax rate if recognized in any future periods. As of December31, 2008, the Company had approximately $11.9 million of total unrecognized tax benefits. Of this total, approximately $8.0 million represented the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective income tax rate if recognized in any future periods.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, in millions, is as follows: 2008 2007 Balance at   January1, $ 9.1 $ 13.9 Additions based   on tax positions related to the current year 2.0 1.0 Additions for   tax positions of prior years 3.8 2.5 Reductions for   tax positions of prior years (1.6 ) (0.3 ) Reductions due   to a lapse of the statute of limitations (0.6 ) (0.4 ) Settlements (0.8 ) (7.6 ) Balance at   December31, $ 11.9 $ 9.1 The Company does not expect significant changes to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of income tax expense. The Company had approximately $1.3 million accrued for interest and penalties at December31, 2007. As of December31, 2008, the Company had approximately $1.4 million accrued for interest and penalties.
37 Table of Contents The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax as well as income tax in multiple international jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for the years prior to 2006 have been audited and completely settled. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2003 in the significant jurisdictions in which it operates.
Note 11  LEASES The Company has operating leases for manufacturing plants, land, warehouses, machinery and equipment, and administrative offices that expire at various times over the next 33 years. Under most leasing arrangements, the Company pays the property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other expenses related to the leased property. Total rental expense under operating leases was approximately $11,542,000 in 2008, $10,378,000 in 2007, and $10,870,000 in 2006.
The Company has capitalized leases for machinery and equipment that expire at various times over the next two years. The present values of minimum future obligations shown in the following chart are calculated based on an interest rate of approximately 4.7 percent, which is the lessors implicit rate of return. Interest expense on the outstanding obligations under capital leases was approximately $5,000 in 2008, $16,000 in 2007, and $15,000 in 2006.
Minimum future obligations on leases in effect at December31, 2008, are: Capital Operating (inthousands) Leases Leases 2009 $ 67 $ 6,682 2010 1 5,009 2011 0 3,632 2012 0 2,488 2013 0 2,036 Thereafter 0 5,801 Total minimum   obligations 68 $ 25,648 Less amount   representing interest 3 Present value of   net minimum obligations 65 Less current   portion 64 Long-term   obligations $ 1 Note 12  SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS The Companys business activities are organized around and aggregated into its two principal business segments, Flexible Packaging and Pressure Sensitive Materials. Both internal and external reporting conform to this organizational structure, with no significant differences in accounting policies applied. Minor intersegment sales are generally priced to reflect nominal markups. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based primarily on operating profit, which is defined as profit before general corporate expense, interest expense, income taxes, and minority interest. While there are similarities in selected technology and manufacturing processes utilized between the Companys business segments, notable differences exist in products, application and distribution of products, and customer base.
Products produced within the Flexible Packaging business segment service packaging applications for markets such as food, medical devices, personal care, agribusiness, chemicals, pet food, and tissue.

Note 13  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in a number of lawsuits incidental to its business, including environmental related litigation. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these cases, management believes, except as discussed below, that any ultimate liability would not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
The Company is a potentially responsible party (PRP) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as Superfund) and similar state laws in proceedings associated with seventeen sites around the United States. During 2008, the Company was identified as a PRP in four new sites. In addition, two sites previously considered closed have been re-opened for potential further remediation. These proceedings were instituted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies at various times beginning in 1983. Superfund and similar state laws create liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances in the environment. Under these statutes, joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators, site owners and operators, and others regardless of fault. Although these regulations could require the Company to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment at various sites, perform remediation work at such sites, orpay damages for loss of use and non-use values, we expect the Companys liability in these proceedings to be limited to monetary damages. The Company expects its future liability relative to these sites to be insignificant, individually and in the aggregate. The Company has reserved an amount that it believes to be adequate to cover its exposure.
Dixie Toga S.A., acquired by the Company on January5, 2005, is involved in a tax dispute with the City of So Paulo, Brazil. The City imposes a tax on the rendering of printing services. The City has assessed this city services tax on the production and sale of printed labels and packaging products. Dixie Toga, along with a number of other packaging companies, disagree and contend that the city services tax is not applicable to its products and that the products are subject only to the state value added tax (VAT). Under Brazilian law, state VAT and city services tax are mutually exclusive and the same transaction can be subject to only one of those taxes. Based on a ruling from the State of So Paulo, advice from legal counsel, and long standing business practice, Dixie Toga appealed the city services tax and instead continued to collect and pay only the state VAT.
39 Table of Contents The City of So Paulo disagreed and assessed Dixie Toga the city services tax for the years 1991-1995. The assessments for those years are estimated to be approximately $47.0 million at the date the Company acquired Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2008 exchange rate. Dixie Toga challenged the assessments and ultimately litigated the issue in two annulment actions filed on November24, 1998 and August16, 1999 in the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo. A decision by the Lower Tax Court in the city of So Paulo in 2002 cancelled all of the assessments for the years 1991-1995. The City of So Paulo, the State of So Paulo, and Dixie Toga have each appealed parts of the lower court decision. In the event of an adverse resolution, the estimated amount for these years could be substantially increased for additional interest, monetary adjustments and costs from the date of acquisition.
The City has also asserted the applicability of the city services tax for the subsequent years 1996-2001 and has issued assessments for those years for Dixie Toga and for Itap Bemis Ltda., a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The assessments for those years were upheld at the administrative level and are being challenged by the companies. The assessments at the date of acquisition for these years for tax and penalties (exclusive of interest and monetary adjustments) are estimated to be approximately $7.1 million for Itap Bemis and $22.8 million for Dixie Toga, translated to U.S. dollars at the December31, 2008 exchange rate. In the event of an adverse resolution, the estimated amounts for these years could be increased by $27.1 million for Itap Bemis and $77.9 million for Dixie Toga for interest, monetary adjustments and costs.
The 1996-2001 assessments for Dixie Toga are currently being challenged in the courts. In pursuing its challenge through the courts, taxpayers are generally required, in accordance with court procedures, to pledge assets as security for its lawsuits. Under certain circumstances, taxpayers may avoid the requirement to pledge assets. Dixie Toga has secured a court injunction that avoids the current requirement to pledge assets as security for its lawsuit related to the 1996-2001 assessments.
The Company strongly disagrees with the Citys position and intends to vigorously challenge any assessments by the City of So Paulo. The Company is unable at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of the controversy and as such has not recorded any liability related to this matter. An adverse resolution could be material to the consolidated results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved.
On September18, 2007, the Secretariat of Economic Law (SDE), a governmental agency in Brazil, initiated an investigation into possible anti-competitive practices in the Brazilian flexible packaging industry against a number of Brazilian companies including a Dixie Toga subsidiary. The investigation relates to periods prior to the Companys acquisition of control of Dixie Toga and its subsidiaries. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings the Company is unable at the present time to predict the outcome of this matter.
The Company and its subsidiary, Morgan Adhesives Company, have been named as defendants inthirteen civil lawsuits related to an investigation that was initiated and subsequently closed by the U.S. Department of Justice without any further action. Six of theselawsuits purport to represent a nationwide class of labelstock purchasers, and each alleges a conspiracy to fix prices within the self-adhesive labelstock industry. The first of these lawsuits was filed on May27, 2003. In these lawsuits, the plaintiffs seek actual damages for the period of the alleged conspiracy (January1, 1996 through July25, 2003) trebled, plus an award of attorneys fees and costs. On November5, 2003, the Judicial Panel on MultiDistrict Litigation issued a decision consolidating all of the federal class actions for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, before the Honorable Chief Judge Vanaskie. On November20, 2007, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. On March6, 2008, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals denied Defendants petition for leave to appeal the district courts decision granting class certification. On June24, 2008, the Court in the consolidated federal class actions issued a decision dismissing the Company from those actions. On January27, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to decertify the class based on new case law in the Third Circuit. At this time, a discovery cut-off has been set for December21, 2009. However, no trial date has been set. TheCompany and Morgan Adhesives Company have also been named in three lawsuits filed in the California Superior Court in San Francisco. These three lawsuits, which have been consolidated, seek to represent a class of all California indirect purchasers of labelstock and each alleges a conspiracy to fix prices within the self-adhesive labelstock industry. Finally, the Company has been named in one lawsuit in Vermont, seeking to represent a class of allVermont indirect purchasers of labelstock, one lawsuit in Nebraska seeking to represent a class of all Nebraska indirect purchasers of labelstock, one lawsuit in Kansas seeking to represent a class of all Kansas indirect purchasers of labelstock, and one lawsuit in Tennessee, seeking to represent a class of purchasers of labelstock in various jurisdictions, all alleging a conspiracy to fix priceswithin the self-adhesive labelstock industry. The Company and Morgan Adhesives Company intend to vigorously defend the state class actions, and Morgan Adhesives Company intends to vigorously defend the federal class actions.
Given the ongoing status of the class-action civil lawsuits, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters although the effect could be material to the results of operations and/or cash flows of the period in which the matter is resolved. The Company is currently not otherwise subject to any pending litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity of the Company.
Note 14  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months and relate primarily to major Western European currencies for our European operations, and the U.S. dollar for our Brazilian operations. The Company has not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating $1,902,000 and $4,971,000, respectively. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to active forward exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as part of accounts payable and as an expense element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and was not significant at December31, 2008 and 2007.
40 Table of Contents Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates expose the Company to changes in the fair value of U.S. dollar denominated debt held at our Dixie Toga business in Brazil. To hedge this exposure, Dixie Toga enters into currency swaps, with maturities that match the underlying debt, effectively converting a portion of Dixie Togas U.S. denominated debt to their functional currency, which is the Brazilian real. Dixie Toga and the Company have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. At December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $24,587,000 and $49,621,000 respectively. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long-term asset or liability and as an expense element of other costs (income), net, which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and was not significant at December31, 2008 and 2007.
The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt resulting from interest rate fluctuations. To hedge this exposure, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $250 million in the third quarter of 2001, effectively converting a portion of the Companys fixed interest rate exposure to a variable rate basis to hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. During 2008, these swaps matured and were net settled, concurrent with the repayment of the underlying $250.0 million debt. The interest rate swaps were accounted for as a fair value hedge. The terms of the interest rate swap agreements were specifically designed to conform to the applicable terms of the hedged items and with the requirements of paragraph 68 of FAS No.133 to support the assumption of no ineffectiveness (changes in fair value of the debt and the swaps exactly offset). The fair value of these interest rate swaps was recorded within long-term debt. Changes in the payment of interest resulting from the interest rate swaps were recorded as an offset to interest expense. See Note 8 for further discussion of the interest rate swaps.
In connection with the issue of seven-year, $300 million notes in March2005, we entered into a forward starting swap on February3, 2005, in order to lock in an interest rate in advance of the pricing date for the notes. On March14, 2005, in connection with the pricing of the notes, we terminated the swap and recorded the resulting gain of $6.1 million (pre-tax) on the balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income. This gain is being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes.
The Companys non-derivative financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. At December31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including current maturities but excluding capitalized leases, is estimated to be $700,945,000 and $779,541,000 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, using discounted cash flow analyses and based on the incremental borrowing rates currently available to the Company for similar debt with similar terms and maturity.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties in interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of the Company. In the unlikely event a counterparty fails to meet the contractual terms of an interest rate swap or foreign exchange forward contract, the Companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instrument. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company has not had any historical instances of non-performance by any counterparties, nor does it anticipate any future instances of non-performance. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and countries. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
