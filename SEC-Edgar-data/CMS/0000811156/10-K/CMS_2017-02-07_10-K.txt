13 Table of Contents PartI Item1.
Business GENERAL CMSEnergy CMSEnergy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and renewable sources.
CMSEnergy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides, and operates principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers consolidated operations account for the substantial majority of CMSEnergys total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMSEnergys consolidated operating revenue was $6.4billion in 2016, $6.5billion in 2015, and $7.2billion in 2014.
For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to all of CMSEnergys business segments and operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataCMSEnergy Selected Financial Information, CMSEnergy Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consumers Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.7million of Michigans 10million residents. Consumers rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as well as to NERC reliability standards, as described in CMSEnergy and Consumers Regulation in this Item1.
Consumers consolidated operating revenue was $6.1billion in 2016, $6.2billion in 2015, and $6.8billion in 2014. For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers electric and gas utility operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataConsumers Selected Financial Information, Consumers Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most electric lines and gas mains are located below or adjacent to public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond Indenture. For additional information on Consumers properties, see Item1. BusinessBusiness SegmentsConsumers Electric UtilityElectric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas UtilityGas Utility Properties.
14 Table of Contents In2016, Consumers served 1.8million electric customers and 1.8million gas customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map are Consumers service territories: Electric   Service Territory Gas   Service Territory Combination   Electric and Gas Service Territory  Electric   Generation Facilities BUSINESS SEGMENTS Consumers Electric Utility Electric Utility Operations: Consumers electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $4.4billion in 2016, $4.2billion in 2015, and $4.4billion in 2014. Consumers electric utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
15 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2016 electric utility operating revenue of $4.4billion by customer class: Residential   (45%) Commercial   (31%) Industrial   (18%) Other   (6%) Consumers electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
In 2016, Consumers electric deliveries were 38billionkWh, which included ROA deliveries of fourbillionkWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34billionkWh. In 2015, Consumers electric deliveries were 37billionkWh, which included ROA deliveries of fourbillionkWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 33billionkWh.
Consumers electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.
16 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2016 and 2015: Consumers 2016 summer peak demand was 8,227MW, which included ROA demand of 592MW. For the 2015-2016 winter season, Consumers peak demand was 5,750MW, which included ROA demand of 480MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term PPAs and short-term capacity purchases, essentially all of the capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2017.
Electric Utility Properties: Consumers transmission and distribution systems consist of:  214miles of transmission overhead lines operating at 138kilovolts  188miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 138kilovolts  fourmiles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 138kilovolts  4,430miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 46kilovolts and 69kilovolts  19miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 46kilovolts  56,067miles of electric distribution overhead lines  10,532miles of underground distribution lines  substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 25millionkVA Consumers is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by METC and operated by MISO.

In December2016, Consumers and Entergy reached an agreement to terminate the Palisades PPA in May2018, subject to timely receipt of certain MPSC approvals.
Consumers generation capacity is a measure of the maximum electric output that Consumers has available to meet peak load requirements. As shown in the following illustration, Consumers 2016 generation capacity of 8,331MW, including purchased capacity of 2,688MW, relied on a variety of fuel sources: Gas   (41%) Coal   (23%) Pumped   Storage (12%) Oil   (10%) Nuclear   (9%) Renewables   (5%) 19 Table of Contents Electric Utility Supply: Presented in the following table are the sources of Consumers electric supply over the last fiveyears: GWh Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Owned   generation Coal 9,739 15,833 15,684 15,951 14,027 Gas 6,194 3,601 2,012 1,415 3,003 Renewable energy 1,083 1,056 748 704 433 Oil 8 - - 4 6 Net pumped   storage 1 (316 ) (186 ) (300 ) (371 ) (295 ) Total owned   generation 16,708 20,304 18,144 17,703 17,174 Purchased   and interchange power Purchased   renewable energy 2 2,229 2,163 2,366 2,250 1,435 Purchased   generation  other 2 13,578 11,720 10,073 10,871 13,104 Net interchange   power 3 3,688 1,327 4,793 3,656 4,151 Total purchased   and interchange power 19,495 15,210 17,232 16,777 18,690 Total supply 36,203 35,514 35,376 34,480 35,864 1 Represents Consumers share of net pumped-storage generation. The pumped-storage facility consumes electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate electricity later during peak-demand hours.
2 Includes purchases under long-term PPAs.
3 Includes purchases from the MISO energy market.
During 2016, Consumers acquired 54percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers needs during peak demand periods.
At December31,2016, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which, in accordance with GAAP, liabilities have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants availability or deliverability. The payments for 2017 through 2036 are estimated to total $9billion and, for each of the next fiveyears, $1billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&ACapital Resources and Liquidity and Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsContractual Commitments.
During 2016, 27percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned sixmillion tons of coal and produced a combined total of 9,739GWh of electricity. This percentage includes seven smaller coal-fueled generating units that Consumers retired in April2016 and that represented four percent of the energy provided to customers in 2016.
In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December31,2016, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $96million. Most of Consumers rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. Consumers vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation. At 20 Table of Contents December31,2016, Consumers had 86percent of its 2017 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 37-day supply of coal on hand.
In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers generating facilities. Consumers coal transportation contracts expire on various dates from 2017 through 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $259million at December31,2016.
During 2016, 17percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by natural gas-fueled generating units, which burned 45bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 6,194GWh of electricity.
In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For units 3 and 4 of D.E.Karn and for the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities. For its smaller combustion turbines, Consumers electric utility purchases and transports gas to its facilities as a bundled-rate tariff customer of either the gas utility or DTEGas.
Presented in the following table is the cost permillion Btu of all fuels consumed, which fluctuates with the mix of fuel used.
Cost Per Million Btu Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Coal $ 2.40 $ 2.49 $ 2.72 $ 2.90 $ 2.98 Gas 2.93 3.06 7.19 4.68 3.16 Oil 9.98 12.28 20.16 19.47 19.08 Weighted-average   fuel cost $ 2.60 $ 2.59 $ 3.17 $ 3.07 $ 3.05 Electric Utility Competition: Consumers electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.
Under existing Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December31,2016, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit. Of Consumers 1.8million electric customers, 305customers, or 0.02percent, purchased generation service under the ROA program. The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017, retains the ten-percent cap on ROA, with certain exceptions. For additional information see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.
Consumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers service territory for economic reasons; municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and customer self-generation. Consumers addresses this competition in various ways, including:  aggressively controlling operating, maintenance, and fuel costs and passing savings on to customers  providing competitive rate-design options, particularly for large energy-intensive customers  offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development  providing non-energy services and value to customers  monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas 21 Table of Contents Consumers Gas Utility Gas Utility Operations: Consumers gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $1.7billion in 2016, $1.9billion in 2015, and $2.4billion in 2014. Consumers gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2016 gas utility operating revenue of $1.7billion by customer class: Residential   (58%) GCC   (21%) Commercial   (11%) Industrial   (4%) Other   (6%) Consumers gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
In 2016, deliveries of natural gas through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, including off-system transportation deliveries, totaled 358bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 46bcf. In 2015, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 356bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 57bcf. Consumers gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2016, 48percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.
22 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2016 and 2015: Gas Utility Properties: Consumers gas transmission, storage, and distribution system consists of:  1,670miles of transmission lines  15gas storage fields with a total storage capacity of 309bcf and a working gas volume of 151bcf  27,920miles of distribution mains  eightcompressor stations with a total of 166,474installed and available horsepower 23 Table of Contents Gas Utility Supply: In 2016, Consumers purchased 73percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and fivepercent from Canadian producers. The remaining 22percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2016: GCR   firm city-gate contracts   (44%) GCR   firm gas transportation contracts   (34%) GCC   suppliers (22%) Firm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, and Trunkline Gas Company,LLC, each a non-affiliated company. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts expire on various dates from 2017 through 2023 and provide for the delivery of 39percent of Consumers total gas supply requirements in 2017. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.
Gas Utility Competition: Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers gas utility business. Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.
Enterprises SegmentNon-Utility Operations and Investments CMSEnergys enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production, the marketing of independent power production, and the development of renewable generation. The enterprises segments operating revenue was $215million in 2016, $190million in 2015, and $299million in 2014.

In 2016, CMSERM marketed sevenbcf of natural gas and 5,906GWh of electricity. Electricity marketed by CMSERM was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment and by unrelated third parties. CMSERMs operating revenue was $199million in 2016, $173million in 2015, and $281million in 2014.
Enterprises Segment Competition: The enterprises segment competes with other independent power producers. The needs of this market are driven by electric demand and the generation available.
Other Businesses EnerBank: EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBanks operating revenue was $120million in 2016, $101million in 2015, and $80million in 2014.
CMSENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local governmental agencies, including those described in the following sections.
FERC and NERC FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMSEnterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMSERM, CMSGas Transmission, and DIG. FERCs jurisdiction includes, among other things, acquisitions, operations, disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates charged, and conduct among affiliates. FERC also has limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMSEnergy. FERC, in connection with NERC and with regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation and transmission owners and operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system.
25 Table of Contents FERC regulates limited aspects of Consumers gas business, principally compliance with FERC capacity release rules, shipping rules, the prohibition against certain buy/sell transactions, and the price-reporting rule.
FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale and transmission rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.
MPSC Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, certain asset transfers, corporate mergers, and other matters.
The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders.
Rate Proceedings: For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlook and Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote3, Regulatory Matters.
Other Regulation The U.S.Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the U.S.Department of Energys Office of Fossil Fuels.
The U.S.Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.
EnerBank is regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC.
Energy Legislation In December2016, Michigans governor signed the 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017. Among other things, the 2016 Energy Law:  raises the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 12.5percent by 2019 and 15percent by 2021  establishes a goal of 35percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025  authorizes incentives for demand response programs and expands existing incentives for energy efficiency programs  authorizes incentives for new PPAs with non-affiliates  establishes an integrated planning process for new generation resources  shortens from twelve months to ten months the time by which the MPSC must issue a final order in general rate cases, but prohibits electric and gas utilities from filing general rate cases for increases in rates more often than once every twelve months  eliminates utilities self-implementation of rates under general rate cases  requires the MPSC to implement equitable cost-of-service rates for customers participating in a net metering program 26 Table of Contents The 2016 Energy Law also establishes a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. Under existing Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. For additional information see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.
CMSENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality, including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. Consumers expects to recover costs to comply with environmental regulations in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item1A. Risk Factors and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote4, Contingencies and Commitments and Note11, Asset Retirement Obligations.
CMSEnergy has recorded a $51million liability for its subsidiaries obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a $107million liability for its obligations at a number of MGP sites. For additional information, see Item1A. Risk Factors and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Air: Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $22million from 2017 through 2021 to comply with present and future federal and state environmental regulations that require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers estimate may increase or decrease depending on future legislation or rulemaking, including regulations regarding greenhouse gases, that could become either more or less stringent.
Solid Waste Disposal: Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Consumers solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigans solid waste rules. In April2015, the EPA published a final ruleregulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under RCRA. The final ruleadopts minimum standards for beneficially reusing and disposing of non-hazardous CCRs. The ruleestablishes new minimum requirements for site location, groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust control, and public disclosure of information. The rulealso sets out conditions under which CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR and non-CCR waste and initiate closure based on the inability to achieve minimum safety standards, meet a location standard, or meet minimum groundwater standards. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems to minimize applicable requirements. In addition, all of Consumers ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital and cost of removal expenditures to comply with regulations relating to ash disposal is $255million from 2017 through 2021.
Water: Consumers uses substantial amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA issued final regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2015. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $109million from 2017 through 2021.
In 2014, the EPA finalized its cooling water intake rule, which requires Consumers to evaluate the biological impact of its cooling water intake systems and ensure that it is using the best technology 27 Table of Contents available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $62million from 2017 through 2021.
For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and UncertaintiesElectric Environmental Outlook.
INSURANCE CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMSEnergy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMSEnergy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMSEnergy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.
CMSEnergys and Consumers present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental costs, such as the cleanup of sites owned by CMSEnergy or Consumers, or claims for the long-term storage or disposal of pollutants or for air pollution.

Item1A.
Risk Factors Actual results in future periods for CMSEnergy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in the following sections. CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMSEnergy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMSEnergy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMSEnergy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant.
CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.
Due to its holding company structure, CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMSEnergy by its subsidiaries, CMSEnergy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity and financial condition.
31 Table of Contents Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMSEnergy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements.
CMSEnergy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.
The level of CMSEnergys present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that:  a significant portion of CMSEnergys cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes  covenants contained in CMSEnergys existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business  CMSEnergys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited  CMSEnergy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged  CMSEnergys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase  CMSEnergys future credit ratings could fluctuate CMSEnergys ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMSEnergy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMSEnergy were unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it could be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing.
CMSEnergy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other contingent liabilities. Consumers capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it invests in the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, conversions and expansions, and other electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. Those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented.
CMSEnergy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if sufficient internal funds are not available from Consumers operations and, in the case of CMSEnergy, from dividends paid by Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments.
Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect CMSEnergys and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Consumers inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act, could adversely affect Consumers access to liquidity. Any liquidity disruption could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash. These measures could include, 32 Table of Contents but are not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing CMSEnergys and Consumers commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.
CMSEnergy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial strategy. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/or common equity, commercial paper, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers may seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMSEnergys and Consumers securities in particular. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies.
Certain of CMSEnergys and Consumers securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase its cost of borrowing, and could cause CMSEnergy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If it were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMSEnergy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMSEnergy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMSEnergys credit ratings. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.
If CMSEnergy or Consumers were unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or were unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, this could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
There are risks associated with Consumers substantial capital investment program planned for the next fiveyears.
Consumers planned investments include the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, gas and electric infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:  effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers control  effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects  availability of qualified construction personnel  changes in commodity and other prices  governmental approvals and permitting  operational performance  changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements  regulatory cost recovery It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
33 Table of Contents Changes to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
The 2016Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at tenpercent, with certain exceptions, of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are placing increasing competitive pressure on the cost of Consumers electric supply. Presently, Consumers electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers system is at the ten-percent limit and the proportion of Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 24percent. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. Consumers is presently permitted to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, although the MPSC may delay, deny, or limit self-implementation upon a showing of good cause. If Consumers self-implements rates that result in higher revenues than would have resulted from rates that the MPSC authorizes in its final order, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017, removes the right to self-implementation for rate cases filed after the effective date and sets a ten-month schedule for a final decision in a general rate case.
In addition, if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers plans for making significant capital investments could be materially adversely affected. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of these investments. In addition, because there are statutory requirements mandating that regulators allow Consumers to recover from customers certain costs, such as resource additions to meet Michigans renewable resource standard, energy optimization, and environmental compliance, regulators could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other requested items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including an economic downturn in the state or diminishment of Consumers customer base. In addition to its potential effects on Consumers investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility properties, regulatory assets, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired generating plants, costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy waste reduction investments and state or federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Energy program costs, or expenditures subject to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non-paying customers, could prevent or curtail Consumers from self-implementing rate changes, could prevent or curtail the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism, or could require Consumers to refund previously self-implemented rates.
FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMSEnergy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys 34 Table of Contents and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates are also set by FERC. FERC orders related to transmission costs could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, investment plans, and results of operations.
Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. If it were determined that they failed to comply, CMSEnergy or Consumers could become subject to fines, penalties, or disallowed costs, or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, or remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies, or challenges or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMSEnergys or Consumers operations could have a similar effect.
Utility regulation could be impacted by various matters, such as electric industry restructuring, hydro relicensing, asset reclassification, gas pipeline capacity and gas storage, new generation facilities or investments, environmental controls, climate change, air emissions, renewable energy, energy policy and ROA, regulation or deregulation, energy capacity standards or markets, reliability, and safety. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these matters on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
FERC, through NERC, oversees reliability of certain portions of the electric facilities owned by CMSEnergy and Consumers. FERC orders regarding electric system reliability could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations that will likely require additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, and CERCLA, will continue to have a material effect on CMSEnergy and Consumers.
CMSEnergy and Consumers have interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. Federal and state environmental laws and rules, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. In October2015, the EPA published rulespursuant to Section111(d)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rulesthe Clean Power Plan. The rules, which are being challenged in court, require a 35 Table of Contents 32percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). The Trump administration has also indicated that it intends to re-examine the Clean Power Plan.
The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations:  litigation originated by third parties against CMSEnergy or Consumers due to CMSEnergys or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage  impairment of CMSEnergys or Consumers reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation  extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assets Consumers retired seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units in2016. Consumers may encounter previously unknown environmental conditions that will need to be addressed in a timely fashion with state and federal environmental regulators as facilities and equipment on these sites are taken out of service.
Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMSEnergys and/or Consumers liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and CMSEnergy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.
For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item1. BusinessCMSEnergy and Consumers Environmental Compliance and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.
A delay or failure by CMSEnergy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could:  prevent the construction of new facilities  prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities  prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities  prevent the modification of existing facilities  result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.
Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to be able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.
36 Table of Contents Consumers also expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.
In addition, certain CMSEnergy subsidiaries retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection, treatment, and discharge of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling their interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. Certain CMSEnergy subsidiaries have signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relating to Bay Harbor. If these CMSEnergy subsidiaries were unable to meet their commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, these CMSEnergy subsidiaries could incur additional material costs relating to their Bay Harbor remediation obligations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.
CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas,Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting. Allegations include price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMSEnergy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMSEnergy may be liable. It is possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
The agreements that CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:  retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions  indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMSEnergy and Consumers make  make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $152million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale. The matter is proceeding to formal arbitration. CMSEnergy is contesting the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.
CMSEnergys and Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Accordingly, CMSEnergys and Consumers overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild 37 Table of Contents temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers system could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.
Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.
In the regular course of business, CMSEnergy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to laws and rulesissued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMSEnergys and Consumers information or control systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events could disrupt operations, subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems are vulnerable to being disabled, failures, cyber crime, and unauthorized access. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMSEnergy and Consumers, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMSEnergy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems were to fail or be breached, CMSEnergy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, because CMSEnergys and Consumers generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMSEnergys or Consumers businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.
A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, or the inability of CMSEnergy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses have liability risks.
Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in 38 Table of Contents part by CMSEnergy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMSEnergy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMSEnergy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.
CMSEnergys and Consumers revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events.
The impact of natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMSEnergy and Consumers could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could result in severe damage to CMSEnergys and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.
Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results.
Distributed electricity generation: Technology advances and government incentives and subsidies could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar photovoltaics, resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs. This could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Energy waste reduction: Customers could reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy waste reduction programs. These reductions could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMSEnergy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.
Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers fuel and purchased power costs are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers manages commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts.
39 Table of Contents No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets.
Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers might not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in laws that limit Consumers ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk.
Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMSEnergy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMSEnergys and Consumers services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMSEnergy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMSEnergys banking subsidiary, EnerBank.
Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.
Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterpartys failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather.
If, for its electric generating capacity, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas or coal requirements under existing or future natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts, or to obtain resources under existing or future PPAs, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generating resources in the MISO energy market. If, for natural gas delivery to its customers, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment 40 Table of Contents program filed with the MPSC. These alternatives could increase Consumers working capital requirements and could decrease its revenues.
Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding.
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMSEnergys and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMSEnergy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMSEnergys and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.
Over 40percent of Consumers employees are represented by unions. In 2015, both of Consumers unions, representing all union employees, ratified three separate five-year agreements, expiring in 2020. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs.
Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations.
The workforce of CMSEnergy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMSEnergys and Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial condition and results of operations could be affected negatively.
Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.
Unforeseen maintenance of Consumers power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, extreme weather, floods or other acts of God, failures of equipment or materials, operator error, or the need to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers costs of generation or be forced to retire a given unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Additionally, unplanned maintenance work could reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and could cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
41 Table of Contents Changes in taxation, including potential federal tax reform, as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMSEnergy and Consumers.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMSEnergy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Changes in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and could involve material costs or affect operations.
Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are still being adopted by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. Under the statute, the activities of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they will be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMSEnergy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain ongoing compliance requirements pursuant to the regulations. CMSEnergy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Ruleon CMSEnergys or EnerBanks operations or financial condition.
Effective July2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMSEnergy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMSEnergy is contractually required (i)to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii)to provide EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeds them as of February2017.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMSEnergy, Consumers, and CMSERM qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities.

49 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This MD&A is a combined report of CMSEnergy and Consumers.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW CMSEnergy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, owns and operates power generation facilities.
CMSEnergy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMSEnergy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility.
CMSEnergy and Consumers earn revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services; electric distribution, transmission, and generation; gas transmission, storage, and distribution; and other energy-related services. Their businesses are affected primarily by:  regulation and regulatory matters  economic conditions  weather  energy commodity prices  interest rates  their securities credit ratings The key elements of CMSEnergys and Consumers business strategy are depicted below: 50 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers are committed to sustainable business practices and to pursuing the goals of safe and excellent operations, a strong ethical culture, environmental quality, and social responsibility. Consumers 2016 Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, provides an overview of Consumers efforts to continue meeting Michigans energy needs safely, efficiently, affordably, and reliably. The report also highlights Consumers commitment to Michigan businesses, its corporate citizenship, and its role in reducing the states air emissions. In a 2016 report published by Sustainalytics, a global leader in sustainability research and analysis, CMSEnergy scored the highest among 54 U.S. utilities in environmental, social, and governance performance.
Safe, Excellent Operations The safety of employees, customers, and the general public remains a priority of CMSEnergy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. In 2016, Consumers reduced recordable safety incidents by 31percent compared with 2015. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2016 was the lowest in Consumers history.
Customer Value Consumers places a high priority on customer value. Consumers capital investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability, which has resulted in measureable improvements in customer satisfaction.
Additionally, Consumers has undertaken several initiatives to keep electricity and natural gas affordable for its customers. These initiatives include the adoption of a lean operations model that is focused on completing work safely and correctly the first time, thus minimizing rework and waste, while delivering services on time. Other cost-saving initiatives undertaken by Consumers include accelerated pension funding, employee and retiree health care cost sharing, replacement of coal-fueled generation with more efficient gas-fueled generation, targeted infrastructure investment, including the installation of smart meters, negotiated labor agreements, information and control system efficiencies, and productivity improvements. In addition, Consumers gas commodity costs declined by 68percent from 2006 through 2016, due not only to a decrease in market prices but also to Consumers improvements to its gas infrastructure and optimization of its gas purchasing and storage strategy. These savings are all passed on to customers.
In December2016, Consumers and Entergy reached an agreement to terminate their PPA in May2018, four years ahead of schedule. Under the PPA, Consumers purchases virtually all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of 798 MW. The prices that Consumers pays under the PPA, and which it recovers from its electric customers, are presently higher than the cost to purchase electricity from the market. The early termination of the PPA is expected to result in an estimated $344 million of savings to be shared equally between Consumers electric customers and Entergy. Under the agreement, Consumers will make a termination payment of $172million to Entergy, with the remaining $172million in estimated savings expected to lower the future energy and capacity costs of Consumers electric customers. Actual savings will depend on market conditions. The agreement is contingent on the MPSCs approval of Consumers recovery in electric rates of the termination payment. The MPSC has indicated that it will make a final determination on this recovery by September2017, after full evaluation of the prudency of the termination payment and of how the termination will impact Michigans electric reliability and resource adequacy.
51 Table of Contents Utility Investment Consumers expects to make capital investments of $18billion from 2017 through 2026. While Consumers has substantially more investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has limited its capital investment program to those investments it believes are needed to provide safe, reliable, and efficient service to its customers. Consumers capital investment program is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of six to eightpercent beginning in 2017. This rate-base growth, together with Consumers cost-control initiatives, should allow Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the rate of inflation.
Presented in the following illustration are planned capital investments of $9.0billion that Consumers expects to make from 2017 through 2021: Electric   base ($2.6 billion) Gas   base ($2.0 billion) Gas   reliability enhancements ($1.8 billion) Electric   reliability enhancements   ($0.7 billion) Environmental   ($0.5 billion) Smart   Energy and Gas AMR ($0.3 billion) Other   ($1.1 billion) Consumers planned base capital investments of $4.6billion represent projects to maintain Consumers system and comprise $2.6 billion at the electric utility to preserve reliability and capacity and $2.0billion at the gas utility to sustain deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity. An additional $2.5billion of planned reliability investments at Consumers are aimed at reducing outages and improving customer satisfaction; these investments comprise $1.8billion at the gas utility to replace mains and enhance transmission and storage systems and $0.7billion at the electric utility to strengthen circuits and substations and replace poles. Consumers also expects to spend $0.5billion on environmental investments needed to comply with state and federal laws and regulations.
Consumers Smart Energy program also represents a major capital investment. Consumers began the full-scale deployment of advanced metering infrastructure for electric and combination customers in 2012 and plans to complete it in 2017. Consumers has spent $0.6billion through 2016 on its Smart Energy program, and expects to spend an additional $0.2billion in 2017. In addition, Consumers expects to spend $0.1billion through 2019 in deploying Gas AMR technology for gas-only customers beginning in 2017.
52 Table of Contents Regulation Regulatory matters are a key aspect of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, particularly Consumers rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC. Important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.
Electric Rate Case: In March2016, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $225million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing also seeks approval of an investment recovery mechanism that would provide for additional annual rate increases of $38million beginning in 2017, $92million beginning in 2018, and $92million beginning in 2019 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation. In September2016, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $170million, subject to refund with interest. In October2016, Consumers reduced its requested annual rate increase to $208million. A final order is due in late February2017.
Gas Rate Case: In August2016, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $90million, based on a 10.6percent authorized return on equity. The filing seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: one that would reconcile annually Consumers actual nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and another that would provide for additional annual rate increases of $35million beginning in 2018 and another $35million beginning in 2019 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation. The MPSC issued an order in January2017, limiting Consumers self-implementation to an annual rate increase of $20million. Accordingly, in January2017, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $20million, subject to refund with interest.
In December2016, Michigans governor signed the 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017. Among other things, the 2016 Energy Law:  raises the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 12.5percent by 2019 and 15percent by 2021  establishes a goal of 35percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025  authorizes incentives for demand response programs and expands existing incentives for energy efficiency programs  authorizes incentives for new PPAs with non-affiliates  establishes an integrated planning process for new generation resources  shortens from twelve months to ten months the time by which the MPSC must issue a final order in general rate cases, but prohibits electric and gas utilities from filing general rate cases for increases in rates more often than once every twelve months  eliminates utilities self-implementation of rates under general rate cases  requires the MPSC to implement equitable cost-of-service rates for customers participating in a net metering program The 2016 Energy Law also establishes a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. Under existing Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. The 2016 Energy Law retains the ten percent cap on ROA, with certain exceptions. The new law also authorizes the MPSC to ensure that alternative electric suppliers have procured enough capacity to cover their anticipated capacity requirements for the subsequent three-year period. The MPSC may require that alternative electric suppliers cover their requirements through participation in a MISO three-year forward capacity auction, by demonstrating to the MPSC that they have procured capacity, or through an MPSC mechanism under 53 Table of Contents which ROA customers would pay a charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier.
Environmental and health and safety regulations are other areas of importance for CMSEnergy and Consumers, and they are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate greenhouse gases, and related litigation. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that these laws and regulations related to their operations will continue to become more stringent and require them to make additional substantial capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, PCB remediation, and gas pipeline safety. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, including the Clean Power Plan, as well as the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, will continue to have a material effect on CMSEnergy and Consumers.
Financial Performance In 2016, CMSEnergys net income available to common stockholders was $551million, and diluted EPS were $1.98. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $523million and diluted EPS of $1.89 in 2015. Among the primary factors contributing to CMSEnergys increased earnings in 2016 were benefits from electric and gas rate increases and higher electric sales due mainly to warmer-than-normal summer weather. These changes were offset partially by higher depreciation and property taxes on increased plant in service and by lower gas deliveries, reflecting warmer-than-normal winter weather in early 2016.
Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMSEnergys and Consumers performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.
Consumers expects that a continued rise in industrial production in its service territory will drive its total electric deliveries to increase annually by about one-halfpercent on average through 2021. Excluding the impacts of energy efficiency programs, Consumers expects its total electric deliveries to increase by about onepercent annually through 2021. Consumers is projecting that its gas deliveries will remain stable through 2021. This outlook reflects growth in gas demand offset by energy efficiency and conservation.
As Consumers seeks to continue to receive fair and timely regulatory treatment, delivering customer value will remain a key strategic priority. In order to minimize increases in customer base rates, Consumers will continue to pursue cost savings through its lean operations model, and will continue to give priority to capital investments that increase customer value or lower costs.
Consumers expects to continue to have sufficient borrowing capacity to fund its investment-based growth plans. CMSEnergy also expects its sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its cash requirements. To identify potential implications for CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses and future financial needs, the companies will continue to monitor developments in the financial and credit markets, as well as government policy responses to those developments.

Electric Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2016, electric delivery revenues increased $122million compared with 2015. This change reflected $91million from a December2015 rate increase and a September2016 self-implemented rate increase, and a $62million increase in sales due primarily to favorable weather. These increases were offset partially by a $25million net decrease in securitization revenue, reflecting the conclusion in October2015 of Consumers 2001 securitization program, and a $6million decrease in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.9billionkWh in 2016 and 37.3billionkWh in 2015.
For 2015, electric delivery revenues increased $78million compared with 2014. This change reflected $67million from a rate increase that Consumers self-implemented in June2015, a $9million increase in revenues related to the renewable energy program, and a $2million increase in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.3billionkWh in 2015 and 37.6billionkWh in 2014.
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2016, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $38million compared with 2015. This change was due to a $27million reduction in expenses at the seven coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in April2016 and a $25million decrease in postretirement benefit costs. The decrease in postretirement benefit costs was attributable primarily to the change to a full-yield-curve approach to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans. Also contributing to the change was a $13million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices and a $4million benefit associated with a State of Michigan use tax settlement. These decreases were offset partially by a $14million increase in forestry expenses, $9million of expenses at the Jackson plant acquired in December2015, a $6million charge associated with a voluntary separation program, and a $2million increase in other operating and maintenance expenses.
For 2015, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $8million compared with 2014. This decrease was due to an $8 million reduction in maintenance costs at the seven coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in April2016, a $5 million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense, and $11million of other operating and maintenance expenses. Additionally, there was a $9million reduction in service restoration costs, reflecting in part the increased capitalization of utility pole units, consistent with a change in regulatory treatment. These decreases were offset largely by a 56 Table of Contents $25million increase in postretirement benefits expense attributable to changes in benefit plan assumptions.
Depreciation and Amortization: For 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased $36million compared with 2015. This change reflected a $94million increase in depreciation expense related to increased plant in service and an increase in depreciation rates that became effective in December2015, offset partially by a $58million decrease in amortization of securitized assets, reflecting the conclusion in October2015 of Consumers 2001 securitization program.
For 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased $45million compared with 2014. This change was due to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service and higher amortization of securitized assets.
General Taxes: For 2016, general taxes increased $15million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending, and the absence, in 2016, of a reduction in general taxes associated with a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015.
For 2015, general taxes increased $4million compared with 2014, due primarily to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending. This increase was offset partially by a reduction in general taxes associated with a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015.
Other Income, Net of Expenses: For 2016, other income, net of expenses, decreased $44million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to a $30million increase in donations and a $2million increase in other expenses. This change also reflected the absence, in 2016, of a $6million benefit related to a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, and a $6million gain on a donation of CMSEnergy stock by Consumers. The gain was eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
For 2015, other income, net of expenses, increased $25million compared with 2014. This change was due to a $13million decrease in donations, a $6million benefit related to a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, and a $6million gain on a donation of CMSEnergy stock by Consumers. The gain was eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
Interest Charges: For 2016, interest charges increased $19million compared with 2015. This change was due to the absence, in 2016, of a $12million reduction in interest expense associated with a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015. The change also reflected $7million attributable primarily to higher average debt levels.
For 2015, interest charges decreased $3million compared with 2014. This change was due primarily to a $12million reduction in interest expense associated with a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, offset largely by $4million attributable to higher average debt levels and a $5million increase in other interest charges related primarily to securitization bonds.
Income Taxes: For 2016, income taxes increased $22million compared with 2015. This change reflected $17million attributable to higher electric utility earnings, a $6million increase due to higher non-deductible donations, and $3million of other tax-related items. These increases were offset partially by a $4million decrease due to a change in the treatment of excess tax benefits on restricted stock awards as a result of the early adoption of a new accounting standard. For additional details on the implementation of this standard, see Note2, New Accounting Standards.
For 2015, income taxes increased $13million compared with 2014. This change reflected $23million attributable to higher electric utility earnings, offset partially by an $8million benefit associated with Cross Winds  Energy Park production tax credits and a $2 million decrease in other tax-related items.

Gas Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2016, gas delivery revenues increased $15million compared with 2015. This change reflected $33million from a January2016 rate increase, offset partially by an $18million decrease in sales due primarily to milder winter weather. Deliveries to end-use customers were 282bcf in 2016 and 299bcf in 2015.
For 2015, gas delivery revenues decreased $11million compared with 2014. This change reflected a $57million decrease in sales due primarily to colder winter weather in 2014, offset largely by $43million from a rate increase implemented in January2015 and a $3million increase in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 299bcf in 2015 and 331bcf in 2014.
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2016, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $23million compared with 2015. This change was due to a $15million decrease in postretirement benefit costs, an $8million reduction in pipeline integrity expenses, and a $7million decrease in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices. The decrease in postretirement benefit costs was attributable primarily to the change to a full-yield-curve approach to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans. These decreases were offset partially by a $4million charge associated with a voluntary separation program and a $3million increase in other gas operating and maintenance expenses.
For 2015, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $9million compared with 2014. This change was due to a $15million increase in postretirement benefits expense, attributable to changes in benefit plan assumptions, and a $10million increase in pipeline integrity expenses. These increases were offset partially by a $16million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices.
Depreciation and Amortization: For 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased $23million compared with 2015, and for 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased $21million compared with 2014. Both increases were due to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service.
General Taxes: For 2016, general taxes increased $7million compared with 2015, and for 2015, general taxes increased $6million compared with 2014. Both increases were due to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.
58 Table of Contents Other Income, Net of Expenses: For 2016, other income, net of expenses, decreased $10million compared with 2015. This change was due primarily to an $8million increase in donations and to the absence, in 2016, of a $3million gain on a donation of CMSEnergy stock by Consumers, offset partially by $1million in other expenses. The gain was eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
For 2015, other income, net of expenses, increased $9million compared with 2014 due primarily to a $4million decrease in donations, $3million from a gain on a donation of CMSEnergy stock by Consumers, and a $2million increase in other income. The gain was eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
Interest Charges: For 2015, interest charges increased $4million compared with 2014 due to higher average debt levels.
Income Taxes: For 2016, income taxes decreased $4million compared with 2015. This reduction was due primarily to a change in the treatment of excess tax benefits on restricted stock awards as a result of the early adoption of a new accounting standard. For additional details on the implementation of this standard, see Note2, New Accounting Standards.
For 2015, income taxes decreased $17million compared with 2014, attributable to lower gas utility earnings.

This increase was due primarily to an $11million after-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt and $8million of higher interest expense, reflecting higher debt levels. These increases were offset partially by a settlement reached with the Michigan Department of Treasury that resulted in a $2million after-tax reduction in general taxes and a $3million reduction in income tax expense, and by $1million of higher earnings at EnerBank. Also contributing to the change were the absence, in 2016, of $6million of additional income tax expense attributable to higher Michigan Corporate Income Tax and to the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain tax credits.
59 Table of Contents For 2015, corporate interest and other net expenses decreased $13million compared with 2014, due to the absence, in 2015, of a $12million after-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt and $7million of higher earnings at EnerBank. These decreases were offset partially by $6million of additional income tax expense attributable to higher Michigan Corporate Income Tax and to the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain tax credits.
CASH POSITION,INVESTING, AND FINANCING At December31,2016, CMSEnergy had $257million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents, which included $22million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. At December31,2016, Consumers had $152million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents, which included $21million of restricted cash and cash equivalents.

2 Core working capital comprises accounts receivable, notes receivable, accrued revenue, inventories, accounts payable, and accrued rate refunds.
For 2016, net cash provided by operating activities at CMSEnergy decreased $11million compared with 2015 and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers decreased $113million compared with 2015. These changes were due primarily to lower customer collections, reflecting lower gas prices and sales volumes, offset partially by lower postretirement benefits contributions and higher net income. At Consumers, higher income tax payments to CMSEnergy also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operations in 2016.
For 2015, net cash provided by operating activities at CMSEnergy increased $159million compared with 2014, and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers increased $440million compared with 2014. These changes were due primarily to gas purchases at lower prices, improved customer collections, and higher net income, offset partially by higher postretirement benefits contributions. At Consumers, lower income tax payments to CMSEnergy also contributed to the improvement in 2015.

The changes were due primarily to the absence, in 2016, of the acquisition of the Jackson power plant and, at CMSEnergy, decreased growth in EnerBank consumer lending. These changes were offset partially by increased capital expenditures.
For 2015, net cash used in investing activities at CMSEnergy increased $166million compared with 2014, and net cash used in investing activities at Consumers increased $158million compared with 2014.
The changes were due primarily to the acquisition of the Jackson power plant and, at CMSEnergy, faster growth in EnerBank consumer lending.

At CMSEnergy, these changes were due primarily to an increase in debt retirements offset partially by debt issuances, lower certificate issuances at EnerBank, and by higher repayments under Consumers commercial paper program. Higher stockholder contributions from CMSEnergy and an increase in debt issuances, offset partially by debt retirements also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 at Consumers.
For 2015, net cash provided by financing activities at CMSEnergy increased $1million compared with 2014 and net cash used in financing activities at Consumers increased $386million compared with 2014. A decrease in debt issuances was offset partially by a decrease in debt retirements and by lower repayments under Consumers commercial paper program. Lower stockholder contributions from CMSEnergy also contributed to the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 at Consumers.
62 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY CMSEnergy uses dividends and tax-sharing payments from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non-utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMSEnergys subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMSEnergy depends upon each subsidiarys revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its debt covenants and articles of incorporation, and potentially by FERC requirements and provisions under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act. For additional details on Consumers dividend restrictions, see Note5, Financings and CapitalizationDividend Restrictions. For the year ended December31,2016, Consumers paid $499million in dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy.
As a result of federal tax legislation passed in December2015 that extends bonus depreciation, CMSEnergy expects to be able to extend the use of federal net operating loss carryforwards and, accordingly, defer its federal income tax payments through 2020. As a consequence, however, CMSEnergy expects to receive lower tax-sharing payments from Consumers during that period. This may require CMSEnergy to maintain higher levels of debt in order to invest in its businesses, pay dividends, and fund its general obligations. Despite this, CMSEnergy does not anticipate a need for a block equity offering.
In April2015, CMSEnergy entered into an updated continuous equity offering program. Under this program, CMSEnergy may sell, from time to time in at the market offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100million. CMSEnergy issued common stock under the program and received proceeds of $60million in 2016 and $30million in 2015.
Consumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from CMSEnergy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, contribute to its employee benefit plans, and fund its other obligations. As a result of accelerated pension funding in recent years and several initiatives to reduce costs, Consumers anticipates continued strong cash flows from operating activities in 2017.
Access to the financial and capital markets depends on CMSEnergys and Consumers credit ratings and on market conditions. As evidenced by past financing transactions, CMSEnergy and Consumers have had ready access to these markets. Barring major market dislocations or disruptions, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets. If access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, CMSEnergy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending.
At December31,2016, CMSEnergy had $549million of its secured revolving credit facility available and Consumers had $893million available. CMSEnergy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. An additional source of liquidity is Consumers commercial paper program, which allows Consumers to issue, in one or more placements, up to $500million in the aggregate in commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365days and that bear interest at fixed or floating rates. These issuances are supported by one of Consumers revolving credit facilities. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the revolving credit facilitys available capacity, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available facility capacity. At December31,2016, $398million of commercial paper notes were outstanding under this program. For additional details on CMSEnergys and Consumers secured revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, see Note5, Financings and Capitalization.
63 Table of Contents Certain of CMSEnergys and Consumers credit agreements, debt indentures, and other facilities contain covenants that require CMSEnergy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. At December31,2016, no default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in CMSEnergys and Consumers credit agreements, debt indentures, or other facilities. CMSEnergy and Consumers were each in compliance with these covenants as of December31,2016, as presented in the following table: December31,2016 Credit   Agreement,Indenture, or Facility Limit Actual CMSEnergy, parent only Debt to   EBITDA 1 < 6.0 to 1.0 4.2 to 1.0 Consumers Debt to   Capital 2 < 0.65 to 1.0 0.49 to 1.0 1 Applies to CMSEnergys $550million revolving and $180million term loan credit agreements.
2 Applies to Consumers $650million and $250million revolving credit agreements and $68million, $35million, and $30million reimbursement agreements.
Components of CMSEnergys and Consumers cash management plan include controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for financing and refinancing opportunities. CMSEnergys and Consumers present level of cash and expected cash flows from operating activities, together with access to sources of liquidity, are anticipated to be sufficient to fund the companies contractual obligations for 2017 and beyond.
64 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations: Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers contractual obligations. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated balance sheets, other than the current portion of long-term debt, capital leases, and financing obligation.

2 In December2016, Consumers and Entergy reached an agreement to terminate the Palisades PPA in May2018, subject to timely receipt of certain MPSC approvals. The payments due reflect the original terms of the PPA. For further details about Palisades, see Note10, Leases and Palisades Financing.
3 Long-term PPAs from certain affiliates of CMSEnterprises.
65 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers also have recognized non-current liabilities for which the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. These items, which are excluded from the table above, include regulatory liabilities, deferred income taxes, workers compensation liabilities, accrued liabilities under renewable energy programs, and other liabilities. Retirement benefits are also excluded from the table above. For details related to benefit payments, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements: CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries enter into various arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities are usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum payment that could be required under a number of these indemnity obligations is not estimable; the maximum obligation under indemnities for which such amounts were estimable was $153million at December31,2016. While CMSEnergy and Consumers believe it is unlikely that they will incur any material losses related to indemnities they have not recorded as liabilities, they cannot predict the impact of these contingent obligations on their liquidity and financial condition. For additional details on these and other guarantee arrangements, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsGuarantees. For additional details on operating leases, see Note10, Leases and Palisades Financing.
Capital Expenditures: Over the next fiveyears, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to make substantial capital investments. CMSEnergy and Consumers may revise their forecasts of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2017 through 2021: In   Billions 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total CMSEnergy, including Consumers Consumers $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 9.0 Enterprises - 0.1 0.1 - - 0.2 Total CMSEnergy $ 1.8 $ 1.9 $ 1.9 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 9.2 Consumers Electric utility   operations $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 1.1 $ 1.1 $ 1.0 $ 5.0 Gas utility operations 0.8 1.0 0.7 0.7 0.8 4.0 Total Consumers $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 9.0 OUTLOOK Several business trends and uncertainties may affect CMSEnergys and Consumers financial condition and results of operations. These trends and uncertainties could have a material impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position. For additional details regarding these and other uncertainties, see Forward-Looking Statements and Information; Item1A. Risk Factors; Note3, Regulatory Matters; and Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
66 Table of Contents Consumers Electric Utility and Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Energy Waste Reduction Plan : The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017, expands the existing energy optimization program to include demand response programs, calling the combined initiatives energy waste reduction. The 2016 Energy Law:  extends the requirement to achieve annual reductions of 1.0percent in customers electricity use through 2021 and 0.75percent in customers natural gas use indefinitely  increases the financial incentives Consumers may earn for exceeding the statutory targets  establishes a goal of 35percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025 Under its existing energy optimization plan, Consumers provides its customers with incentives to reduce usage by offering energy audits, rebates and discounts on purchases of highly efficient appliances, and other incentives and programs. Consumers estimates that, through its gas and electric energy optimization programs, its customers realized $370million in savings during 2016.
Smart Energy and Gas AMR: Consumers began the full-scale deployment of smart meters in 2012 and expects to complete it in 2017. Smart meters allow customers to monitor and manage their energy usage, which Consumers expects will help reduce demand during critical peak times, resulting in lower peak electric capacity requirements. In addition, Consumers is able to disconnect and reconnect service, read, and bill from smart meters remotely. Consumers will continue to add further functionality to its smart meters. Consumers is also installing communication modules on gas meters in areas where it provides both electricity and natural gas to customers. The communication modules allow Consumers to read and bill from gas meters remotely.
Consumers expects that under its Smart Energy program it will have installed a total of 1.8million smart meters and 600,000 communication modules throughout its service territory by the end of 2017. As of December31,2016, Consumers had upgraded 1.4million electric customers to smart meters and had installed 370,000 communication modules on gas meters.
In areas where it provides only natural gas to customers, Consumers will begin the deployment of Gas AMR technology in 2017 and expects to complete it in 2019. Under this program, communication modules are expected to be installed on 1.2million gas meters, allowing Consumers to conduct drive-by meter reading.
Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Energy Resource Planning: Consumers continues to experience increasing demand for electricity due to Michigans growing economy and increased use of air conditioning, consumer electronics, and other electric devices, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation.
In April2016, Consumers retired seven of its coal-fueled electric generating units, representing 950MW of capacity. In December2016, Consumers and Entergy reached an agreement to terminate their PPA under which Consumers purchases virtually all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of 798MW. Under the agreement, which is contingent on the MPSCs approval of Consumers recovery in electric rates of the termination payment, the PPA would terminate in May2018, fouryears ahead of schedule. For additional details on this agreement, see Note10, Leases and Palisades Financing.
67 Table of Contents Even with the retirements of seven of its coal-fueled units and the expected termination of the Palisades PPA, Consumers expects to meet the capacity requirements of its full-service customers through:  energy waste reduction  expanded use of renewable energy  the use of the Jackson plant, a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant purchased in December2015  construction or purchase of electric generating units  continued operation or upgrade of existing units, including upgrades at Ludington  renegotiations of existing PPAs  purchases of short-term market capacity In October2016, Consumers completed an auction to purchase generation capacity and secure its capacity requirements for 2017. The MSPC approved the contracts entered into as a result of the auction in January2017. As demand forecasts become more certain, Consumers may take additional actions to meet the capacity requirements of its full-service customers.
Renewable Energy Plan: The 2016 Energy Law raises the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 15percent in 2021, with an interim target of 12.5percent in 2019.
Consumers is required to submit RECs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource, in an amount equal to at least the required percentage of Consumers electric sales volume each year. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers expects to meet its renewable energy requirement each year with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years.
In conjunction with its renewable energy plan, Consumers signed a 15-year agreement in September2015 to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 100-MW wind park to be constructed in Huron County, Michigan. The wind park is expected to be operational in 2017. In September2016, Consumers applied for a special land use permit for the construction of two additional phases at its Cross Winds  Energy Park: Phase II, with a nameplate capacity of 44MW, and Phase III, with a nameplate capacity of 76MW. Both phases of the project will qualify for certain federal production tax credits, which are expected to generate cost savings that will be passed on to customers. Consumers also completed construction of two community solar projects in 2016. Together, these solar projects provide a combined fourMW of nameplate capacity .
Electric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers electric customer deliveries are largely dependent on Michigans economy. Consumers expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to increase in 2017 by one-halfpercent compared with 2016.
Over the next fiveyears, Consumers plans conservatively for average electric delivery growth of about one-halfpercent annually. This increase reflects growth in electric demand, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency programs and appliance efficiency standards. Actual delivery levels will depend on:  energy conservation measures and results of energy waste reduction programs  weather fluctuations  Michigans economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, and housing activity Electric ROA: Under existing Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December31,2016, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit. Of 68 Table of Contents Consumers 1.8million electric customers, 305customers, or 0.02percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program.
The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017, retains the tenpercent cap on ROA, with certain exceptions, but establishes a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. The new law also authorizes the MPSC to ensure that alternative electric suppliers have procured enough capacity to cover their anticipated capacity requirements for the subsequent three-year period. The MPSC may require that alternative electric suppliers cover their requirements through participation in a MISO three-year forward capacity auction, by demonstrating to the MPSC that they have procured capacity, or through an MPSC mechanism under which ROA customers would pay a charge to the utility for capacity that is not provided by the alternative electric supplier.
Electric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers electric utility business. For additional details on rate matters, including the 2016 electric rate case, see Note3, Regulatory Matters.
PSCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2017 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2016 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2017 PSCR charge beginning in January2017.
FERC Transmission Order: In September2016, FERC issued an order reducing the rate of return on equity earned by transmission owners operating within MISO to a base of 10.32percent from 12.38percent. FERC ordered MISO and transmission owners to provide refunds, with interest, to transmission customers such as Consumers for the period from November2013 through February2015. Consumers will return to its electric customers the transmission refunds that it receives as a result of this order, which is subject to further legal proceedings.
As a transmission owner since April2016, which is subsequent to the period covered by this order, Consumers would provide no refund to its transmission customers. In addition, Consumers is eligible for a 50-basis-point increase to its transmission return on equity as a transmission-owning member of MISO.
Depreciation Rate Case: In November2016, Consumers filed a depreciation rate case related to its Ludington electric utility property, requesting to increase depreciation expense by $15million annually.
Electric Environmental Outlook: Consumers operations are subject to various state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $0.5billion from 2017 through 2021 to continue to comply with the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and numerous state and federal environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters.
Air Quality: CSAPR, which became effective in January2015, requires Michigan and 27 other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA computer models, contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other downwind states. In September2016, the EPA finalized new ozone season standards for CSAPR, which will begin in May2017. CSAPR is presently being litigated; however, any decision will not impact Consumers compliance strategy, as Consumers expects its emissions to be within the CSAPR allowance allocations.
In 2012, the EPA published emission standards for electric generating units, based on Section112 of the Clean Air Act, calling the final ruleMATS. Under MATS, all of Consumers existing coal-fueled electric generating units were required to add additional controls for hazardous air pollutants. Consumers met the extended deadline of April2016 for five coal-fueled units and two oil/gas-fueled units it continues to operate and retired its seven remaining coal-fueled units. MATS is presently being litigated, but any decision is not expected to impact Consumers MATS compliance strategy. In addition, Consumers must 69 Table of Contents still comply with the Michigan Mercury Ruleand with its settlement agreement with the EPA entered into in November2014 concerning opacity and NSR.
In October2015, the EPA released its new ruleto lower the NAAQS for ozone. The new ozone NAAQS will make it more difficult to construct or modify power plants in many areas of the country, including some parts of Michigan, if the areas are designated to be in nonattainment of the new standard. Consumers is monitoring the designation process of this ruleto determine what, if any, effect it will have on its electric generating units.
Consumers strategy to comply with air quality regulations, including CSAPR, NAAQS, and MATS, involved the installation of emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate these rulesin conjunction with other EPA rulemakings, litigation, and congressional action. This evaluation could result in:  a change in Consumers fuel mix  changes in the types of generating units Consumers may purchase or build in the future  changes in how certain units are used  the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of Consumers generating units  changes in Consumers environmental compliance costs Greenhouse Gases: There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, national, and international levels that involve the potential regulation of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives and to follow litigation involving greenhouse gases.
In August2015, the EPA finalized new rulespursuant to Section111(b)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new electric generating units. New coal-fueled units will not be able to meet this limit without installing carbon dioxide control equipment using such methods as carbon capture and sequestration. Also in August2015, the EPA finalized new rulespursuant to Section111(b)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from modified or reconstructed electric generating units. Both of these rulesare being litigated.
In October2015, the EPA published final rulespursuant to Section111(d)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rulesthe Clean Power Plan. Certain states, corporations, and industry groups have initiated litigation opposing the proposed Clean Power Plan. In February2016, the U.S.Supreme Court stayed the Clean Power Plan while the litigation proceeds. While Michigans Attorney General has joined the litigation, the governor had indicated that Michigan intended to file a state carbon implementation plan, which was to be submitted for EPA review and approval in 2018. Work on this plan has ceased, however, in light of the stay of the Clean Power Plan and pending outcome of the litigation.
The ruleswould require a 32percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). Initial state implementation plans would have been due September2016 with extensions available until 2018. It is expected that these deadlines will be extended as a result of the rulesbeing stayed. States choosing not to develop their own implementation plans would be subject to the federal plan. The Trump administration has indicated that it intends to re-examine the Clean Power Plan.
In December2015, a group of 195 countries finalized the Paris Agreement, which governs carbon dioxide reduction measures beginning in 2020. As part of this agreement, the United States pledged a 26percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 (with aspirations to achieve a 28percent reduction) compared with 2005 levels. These targets are in line with the now-stayed Clean Power Plan targets. While these emission reduction commitments are non-binding, they will be governed by the Clean Power Plan 70 Table of Contents should it survive judicial scrutiny. The Trump administration has indicated that it intends to re-examine the Paris Agreement.
Consumers believes that it is favorably positioned to deal with the impact of carbon regulation through its clean energy plan, its present carbon reduction target, and its emphasis on supply diversity. Consumers cannot, however, predict the outcome of these EPA rulesin court, of changes in policy under the new Trump administration, or of Michigans potential implementation plan. Consumers will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding greenhouse gas emissions standards that may affect electric generating units.
Litigation, as well as federal laws, EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if enacted or ratified, could require Consumers to replace equipment, install additional emission control equipment, purchase emission allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.
CCRs: In April2015, the EPA published a final ruleregulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under RCRA. The final ruleadopts minimum standards for beneficially reusing and disposing of non-hazardous CCRs. The ruleestablishes new minimum requirements for site location, groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust control, and public disclosure of information. The rulealso sets out conditions under which CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR and non-CCR waste and initiate closure based on the inability to achieve minimum safety standards, meet a location standard, or meet minimum groundwater standards. Consumers continues to develop work plans for submission to the MDEQ for concurrence to ensure coordination between federal and state requirements. Furthermore, Congress passed legislation in December2016 that allows states to develop a permitting program for CCR under RCRA, and Michigan may adopt such a program. As a result, Consumers may need to adjust its recorded ARO associated with coal ash disposal sites depending on the outcome of its submissions to the MDEQ and on a future RCRA permitting program under MDEQ, if the EPA approves a state-level program. Consumers has historically been authorized to recover in electric rates costs incurred related to cleanup and closure of coal ash disposal sites.
Water: The EPAs ruleto regulate existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems under Section316(b)of the Clean Water Act became effective in October2014. The ruleis aimed at reducing alleged harmful impacts on fish and shellfish. In November2015, the EPA released its final effluent limitation guidelines, which set stringent new requirements for the discharge from electric generating units into wastewater streams. Consumers believes its environmental strategy will allow it to achieve compliance with these final rules.
In June2015, the EPA and the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers published a final ruleredefining waters of the United States, which designates the EPAs jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Numerous states and other interested parties, including Michigans Attorney General, have filed suits in federal courts to block the rule, which was stayed in October2015, and that litigation remains pending. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the final rule. The Trump administration has indicated that it intends to re-examine the waters of the United States rule.
Many of Consumers facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are valid for fiveyears and vital to the facilities operations. Failure of the MDEQ to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility.
71 Table of Contents PCBs: In 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, indicating that it is considering a variety of regulatory actions with respect to PCBs. One approach would aim to phase out equipment containing PCBs by 2025. Another approach would eliminate an exemption for small equipment containing PCBs. To comply with any such regulatory actions, Consumers could incur substantial costs associated with existing electrical equipment potentially containing PCBs. A rulemay be proposed in 2017.
Other electric environmental matters could have a material impact on Consumers outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsConsumers Electric Utility ContingenciesElectric Environmental Matters.
Consumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Gas Deliveries: Consumers expects weather-adjusted gas deliveries in 2017 to decrease by onepercent compared with 2016. Over the next fiveyears, Consumers plans conservatively for stable deliveries. This outlook reflects modest growth in gas demand offset by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary from this expectation due to:  weather fluctuations  use by power producers  availability and development of renewable energy sources  gas price changes  Michigan economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity  the price of competing energy sources or fuels  energy efficiency and conservation impacts Gas Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers gas utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters.
Gas Rate Case: In August2016, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $90million, based on a 10.6percent authorized return on equity. The largest component of the request is an annual revenue requirement of $84million related to new investments that will allow Consumers to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability.
The filing also seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: one that would reconcile annually Consumers actual nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and another that would provide for additional annual rate increases of $35million beginning in 2018 and another $35million beginning in 2019 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation . These future investments are intended to help ensure adequate system capacity and deliverability.
The MPSC issued an order in January2017, limiting Consumers self-implementation to an annual rate increase of $20million. Accordingly, in January2017, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $20million, subject to refund with interest.
Depreciation Rate Case: In August2016, Consumers filed a depreciation rate case related to its gas utility property, requesting to decrease depreciation expense by $3million annually.
Gas Transmission: In September2016, Consumers filed an application with to the MPSC to invest $610million in the construction of a 95-mile, 24-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline in Saginaw and Oakland Counties, Michigan. Consumers expects the pipeline, if approved, to be operational by the end of 2022.
72 Table of Contents GCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2017-2018GCR plan to the MPSC in December2016 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, expects to self-implement the 2017-2018GCR charge beginning in April2017.
Gas Pipeline Safety: In October2016, the U.S.Department of Transportations Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration published a final rulethat will require the installation of additional safety valves on certain gas distribution service lines beginning in 2017. Consumers is evaluating the cost of complying with this rule, but expects that it will be able to recover the cost in rates, consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and regulations.
Gas Environmental Outlook: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23former MGP sites. For additional details, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsConsumers Gas Utility ContingenciesGas Environmental Matters.
Enterprises Outlook and Uncertainties The primary focus with respect to CMSEnergys non-utility businesses is to maximize the value of their generating assets, which represent 1,077MW of capacity, and to pursue opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects.
Trends, uncertainties, and other matters that could have a material impact on CMSEnergys consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include:  changes in energy and capacity prices  changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings  changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation  the outcome of certain legal proceedings  indemnity and environmental remediation obligations at Bay Harbor  obligations related to a tax claim from the government of Equatorial Guinea  representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMSEnergy in connection with previous sales of assets For additional details regarding the enterprises segments uncertainties, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Other Outlook and Uncertainties EnerBank: EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank represented fourpercent of CMSEnergys net assets at December31,2016, and fivepercent of CMSEnergys net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December31,2016. The carrying value of EnerBanks loan portfolio was $1.3billion at December31,2016. Its loan portfolio was funded primarily by certificates of deposit of $1.2billion. The twelve-month rolling average net default rate on loans held by EnerBank was onepercent at December31,2016. CMSEnergy is required both by law and by contract to provide financial support, including infusing additional capital, to ensure that EnerBank satisfies mandated capital requirements and has sufficient liquidity to operate. With its self-funding plan, EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeded them as of December31,2016.
Employee Separation Program: In June2016, CMSEnergy and Consumers announced a voluntary separation program for non-union employees. CMSEnergy and Consumers recorded a charge of $11million related to this program, under which 176 employees accepted and were approved for early 73 Table of Contents separation. After hiring replacements for certain positions, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect a net reduction of 126 employees. This will result in future cost savings, as employee staffing levels will be better matched to workload demand, which reflects CMSEnergys and Consumers ongoing productivity and quality improvements.
Litigation: CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters and Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and related information are important to an understanding of CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Note1, Significant Accounting Policies.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions In the preparation of CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMSEnergy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, and contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.
Accounting for the Effects of Industry Regulation: Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators decisions on its financial statements. Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMSEnergy and Consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMSEnergy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. For additional details, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract.
The criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting or for an exception from derivative accounting are complex and often require judgment in application. Changes in business 74 Table of Contents strategies or market conditions, as well as a requirement to apply different interpretations of the derivative accounting literature, could result in changes in accounting for a single contract or groups of contracts, which could have a material impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers financial statements. For additional details on CMSEnergys and Consumers derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Note6, Fair Value Measurements.
Income Taxes: The amount of income taxes paid by CMSEnergy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMSEnergys judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMSEnergy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMSEnergys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time. For additional details, see Note14,Income Taxes.
Pension and OPEB: CMSEnergy and Consumers provide retirement pension benefits to certain employees under a non-contributory DBPension Plan, and they provide postretirement health and life benefits to qualifying retired employees under an OPEB Plan.
CMSEnergy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:  life expectancies  discount rates  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases  expected health care costs A change in these assumptions could change significantly CMSEnergys and Consumers recorded liabilities and associated expenses.
Presented in the following table are estimates of CMSEnergys and Consumers DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan costs (credits) through 2019. Neither CMSEnergy nor Consumers plans to contribute to the DBPension Plan or OPEB Plan through 2019. Actual future costs and contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan participants.
In Millions DBPension OPEB Plan Plan Cost Cost(Credit) CMSEnergy,   including Consumers 2017 $ 65 $ (21 ) 2018 78 (21 ) 2019 82 (23 ) Consumers 1 2017 $ 63 $ (16 ) 2018 75 (16 ) 2019 79 (18 ) 1 Consumers pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process.
75 Table of Contents In January2016, CMSEnergy and Consumers changed the method they use to determine the discount rate used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans. For further details, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the DBPension Plan assets by 25basis points (from 7.25percent to 7.00percent) would increase estimated DBPension Plan cost for 2017 by $5million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers. Lowering the PBO discount rate by 25 basis points (from 4.30percent to 4.05percent) would increase estimated DBPension Plan cost for 2017 by $6million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers.
Pension and OPEB plan assets are accounted for and disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require judgment.
For additional details on postretirement benefits, including the fair value measurements for the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan assets, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Revenue Subject to Refund: Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing; however, the rates that Consumers self-implements may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, it records a provision for revenue subject to refund. A final rate order could differ materially from Consumers estimates underlying its self-implemented rates, giving rise to accounting adjustments. Under accounting rulesfor prior period adjustments, CMSEnergy and Consumers may need to record such differences, if they are specifically identifiable to prior interim periods, as revisions to those periods. The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017, eliminates utilities self-implementation of rates under general rate cases, but provides for more timely processing of general rate cases.
Unbilled Revenues: Consumers customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as accounts receivable on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated balance sheets, were $361million at December31,2016 and $325million at December31,2015.
Market Risk Information CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and investment security prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to mitigate exposure to these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into these contracts using established policies and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of certain officers and a risk committee consisting of those and other officers and business managers.
The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial instruments, assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of tenpercent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were to exceed tenpercent.
Interest-Rate Risk: CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate financing instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital.
76 Table of Contents Presented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of interest-rate risk (assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of tenpercent): In Millions December31 2016 2015 Fixed-rate   financing  potential loss in fair value CMSEnergy,   including Consumers $ 291 $ 263 Consumers 175 161 The fair value losses in the above table could be realized only if CMSEnergy and Consumers transferred all of their fixed-rate financing to other creditors. The annual earnings exposure related to variable-rate financing was insignificant for both CMSEnergy and Consumers at December31,2016 and 2015, assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of tenpercent.
Investment Securities Price Risk: Through investments in equity securities, CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to equity price fluctuations. The following table shows the potential effect of adverse changes in equity prices on CMSEnergys and Consumers available-for-sale investments.
Presented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of investment securities price risk (assuming an adverse change in market prices of tenpercent): In Millions December31 2016 2015 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Potential   reduction in fair value of available-for-sale securities DBSERP Mutual funds $ 14 $ 15 Consumers Potential   reduction in fair value of available-for-sale securities DBSERP Mutual funds $ 10 $ 10 CMSEnergy   common stock 3 3 Notes Receivable Risk: CMSEnergy is exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from EnerBanks fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank provides these loans to homeowners to finance home improvements.

92 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: CMSEnergy and Consumers prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. CMSEnergys co nsolidated financial statements comprise CMSEnergy, Consumers, CMSEnterprises, and all other entities in which CMSEnergy has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Consumers consolidated financial statements comprise Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy uses the equity method of accounting for investments in companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they have significant influence over operations and financial policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy and Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.
Use of Estimates : CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Policy: CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize revenue from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the transportation, processing, and storage of natural gas, when services are provided. CMSEnergy and Consumers record unbilled revenue for the estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. CMSEnergy and Consumers record sales tax net and exclude it from revenue. CMSEnergy recognizes revenue on sales of marketed electricity, natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.
Alternative-Revenue Program: The energy optimization incentive mechanism provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. The maximum incentive that Consumers may earn under this mechanism is 15percent of the amount it spends on energy optimization programs, which is limited to twopercent of Consumers retail revenue. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC. The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017, expands existing incentives for energy efficiency programs.
Self-Implemented Rates: Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing if the MPSC has not issued an order in the case. The MPSC then has another six months to issue a final order. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within that period, the filed rates are considered approved. If the MPSC issues a final order within that period, the rates that Consumers self-implemented may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, then Consumers records a provision for revenue subject to refund. The 2016 Energy Law, which will become effective in April2017, eliminates utilities self-implementation of rates under general rate cases, but provides for more timely processing of general rate cases.
EnerBank: EnerBank provides four types of unsecured consumer installment loans: same-as-cash, zero interest, reduced interest, and traditional. Under EnerBanks same-as-cash programs, authorized contractors pay EnerBank a fee to provide a borrower with the option to pay off the loan interest-free during the same-as-cash period. EnerBank recognizes the fee on a straight-line basis over the same-as-cash period, which typically ranges from three to 24months. If a borrower does not exercise its option to 93 Table of Contents pay off its loan interest-free during the same-as-cash period, EnerBank charges the borrower accrued interest at the loans contractual rate on the outstanding balance from the origination date. Under the zero interest and reduced interest programs, authorized contractors pay EnerBank a fee to provide a borrower with no interest or reduced rates of interest for the entire term of the loan. EnerBank recognizes the fee using the interest method over the term of the loan, which ranges from one to 12years. Unearned income associated with the fees is recorded as a reduction to notes receivable on CMSEnergys consolidated balance sheets.
EnerBank recognizes interest income using the interest method and amortizes loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, over the loan term. EnerBank ceases recognizing interest income when a loan loss is confirmed or when a loan becomes 120days past due, at which time the loan principal is charged against the allowance for loan losses. At that time, EnerBank recognizes any interest accrued but not received for such loan losses as a reversal of interest income.
The loan fees and interest income earned by EnerBank are reported as operating revenue on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable comprise trade receivables and unbilled receivables. CMSEnergy and Consumers record their accounts receivable at cost, which approximates fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses, managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with customers. CMSEnergy and Consumers charge off accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers record estimated liabilities for contingencies on their consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For environmental remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMSEnergy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. CMSEnergy and Consumers expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on estimates of work performed.
Debt Issuance Costs, Discounts, Premiums, and Refinancing Costs: Upon the issuance of long-term debt, CMSEnergy and Consumers defer issuance costs, discounts, and premiums and amortize those amounts over the terms of the associated debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Upon the refinancing of long-term debt, Consumers, as a regulated entity, defers any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with the refinanced debt and amortizes those amounts over the term of the newly issued debt. For the non-regulated portions of CMSEnergys business, any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with extinguished debt are charged to earnings.
Derivative Instruments: In order to support ongoing operations, CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into contracts for the future purchase and sale of various commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, and coal. These forward contracts are generally long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of the commodity at a contracted price. Most of these contracts are not subject to derivative accounting for one or more of the following reasons:  they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity or bcf of natural gas)  they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  there is not an active market for the commodity 94 Table of Contents Consumers coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is not an active market for the coal it purchases. If an active market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts may qualify as derivatives. Since Consumers is subject to regulatory accounting, the resulting fair value gains and losses would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and would not affect net income.
Consumers also uses FTRs to manage price risk related to electricity transmission congestion. An FTR is a financial instrument that entitles its holder to receive compensation or requires its holder to remit payment for congestion-related transmission charges. Consumers accounts for FTRs as derivatives. All changes in fair value associated with FTRs are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities until the instruments are settled.
CMSEnergy and Consumers record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value on their consolidated balance sheets. Each reporting period, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. Since none of CMSEnergys or Consumers derivatives has been designated as an accounting hedge, all changes in fair value are either reported in earnings or deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. For details regarding CMSEnergys and Consumers derivative instruments recorded at fair value, see Note6, Fair Value Measurements.
Earnings Per Share: CMSEnergy calculates basic and diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of nonvested stock awards and contingently convertible securities. CMSEnergy computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which are those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note15, Earnings Per ShareCMSEnergy.
Financial Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers record debt and equity securities classified as available for sale at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these securities are determined on a specific-identification basis. CMSEnergy and Consumers report unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings. For additional details regarding financial instruments, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMSEnergy and Consumers perform tests of impairment if certain triggering events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.
CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow analyses.
CMSEnergy also assesses equity method investments for impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This assessment requires CMSEnergy to determine the fair value of the equity method investment. CMSEnergy determines fair value using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment. CMSEnergy records an impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary.
95 Table of Contents Inventory: CMSEnergy and Consumers use the weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas, recoverable base gas in underground storage facilities, and materials and supplies inventory. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and they classify these amounts as generating plant fuel stock on their consolidated balance sheets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers account for RECs and emission allowances as inventory and use the weighted-average cost method to remove amounts from inventory. RECs and emission allowances are used to satisfy compliance obligations related to the generation of power. CMSEnergy and Consumers classify these amounts within other assets on their consolidated balance sheets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate inventory for impairment as required to ensure that its carrying value does not exceed the lower of cost or net realizable value.
MISO Transactions: MISO requires the submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. CMSEnergy and Consumers account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and day-ahead markets, netted across all MISO energy market locations. CMSEnergy and Consumers record net hourly purchases in purchased and interchange power and net hourly sales in operating revenue on their consolidated statements of income. They record net billing adjustments upon receipt of settlement statements, record accruals for future net purchases and sales adjustments based on historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses and sales upon receipt of settlement statements.
Property Taxes: Property taxes are based on the taxable value of Consumers real and personal property assessed by local taxing authorities. Consumers records property tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied based on Consumers budgeted customer sales. The deferred property tax balance represents the amount of Consumers accrued property tax that will be recognized over future governmental fiscal periods.
Renewable Energy Grant: In 2013, Consumers received a renewable energy cash grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park under Section1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009. Upon receipt of the grant, Consumers recorded a regulatory liability, which Consumers is amortizing over the life of Lake Winds  Energy Park. Consumers presents the amortization as a reduction to maintenance and other operating expenses on its consolidated statements of income. Consumers recorded the deferred income taxes related to the grant as a reduction of the book basis of Lake Winds  Energy Park.
Other: For additional accounting policies, see:  Note8, Notes Receivable  Note9, Plant, Property, and Equipment  Note11, Asset Retirement Obligations  Note12, Retirement Benefits  Note14, Income Taxes  Note17, Cash and Cash Equivalents 2: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Implementation of New Accounting Standards ASU2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period: This standard, which was effective on January1,2016 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, addresses stock awards with performance targets that can be met after an employee has completed the required service period. The standard was issued to resolve diversity in practice regarding the accounting treatment for this type of award. Under the new guidance, the probability of the performance target being met should be factored into compensation 96 Table of Contents expense each period. This guidance is consistent with the accounting that CMSEnergy and Consumers already applied to awards of this type. Therefore, the standard had no impact on CMSEnergys or Consumers consolidated financial statements.
ASU2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis: This standard, which was effective on January1,2016 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, provides amended guidance on whether reporting entities should consolidate certain legal entities, including limited partnerships. CMSEnergy and Consumers determined that the standard did not change any of their consolidation conclusions or have any impact on their consolidated net income, cash flows, or financial position.
ASU2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs: This standard, which was effective on January1,2016 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Previously, debt issuance costs were reported as an asset. The new guidance aligns the presentation of debt issuance costs with debt discounts and premiums. In accordance with the standard, CMSEnergy included $45million and Consumers included $25million of unamortized debt issuance costs in long-term debt on their consolidated balance sheets at December31,2016. In addition, this standard requires that entities apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented. Accordingly, CMSEnergy reclassified $41million and Consumers reclassified $23million of unamortized debt issuance costs from other non-current assets to long-term debt on their consolidated balance sheets at December31,2015.
ASU2016-09,Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting: This standard was issued to simplify and improve the accounting for employee share-based payment awards. The required effective date of the standard for CMSEnergy and Consumers is January1,2017, but early adoption is permitted. CMSEnergy and Consumers elected to adopt the standard early as of January1,2016. The standard requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies that occur upon vesting of employee stock awards to be recognized in net income. Previously, CMSEnergy and Consumers did not record excess tax benefits on restricted stock awards in net income but, under this standard, CMSEnergy and Consumers recorded $7million of excess tax benefits in net income for the year ended December31,2016. Also, in accordance with the standard, CMSEnergy recorded a $33million cumulative adjustment to its accumulated deficit at January1,2016. This amount represented excess federal tax benefits that CMSEnergy had not recognized in prior periods due to the use of tax loss carryforwards. The implementation of this standard had no other major impacts on CMSEnergys or Consumers consolidated financial statements.
ASU2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments: This standard provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified in the statement of cash flows, with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The required effective date of the standard for CMSEnergy and Consumers is January1,2018, but early adoption is permitted. CMSEnergy and Consumers elected to adopt the standard early for the year ended December31,2016. The standard addresses various cash flow issues, including debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs. Under the new guidance, these costs, including premiums paid, should be classified as cash flows from financing activities. Previously, CMSEnergy and Consumers classified premiums paid to retire debt early as cash flows from operating activities but, in accordance with this standard, they classified these payments as cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December31,2016. In addition, the standard requires that entities apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented, unless impracticable. Accordingly, for the year ended December31,2014, CMSEnergy reclassified $36million and Consumers reclassified $16million of debt retirement premium payments from operating activities to financing activities on their consolidated statements of cash flows. The standard had no other major impacts on CMSEnergys or Consumers consolidated financial statements.
ASU2016-18, Restricted Cash: This standard requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. Under this guidance, the statement of cash flows should explain the total 97 Table of Contents change in cash balances, including amounts described as restricted. The required effective date of the standard for CMSEnergy and Consumers is January1,2018, but early adoption is permitted. CMSEnergy and Consumers elected to adopt the standard early for the year ended December31,2016. In accordance with the standard, CMSEnergy and Consumers included restricted cash amounts in their reconciliations of cash balances on their consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December31,2016. Previously, restricted cash amounts were excluded from the reconciliations of cash balances and transfers between cash balances and restricted cash balances were presented as other investing activities. In addition, the standard requires that entities apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented. Accordingly, CMSEnergy and Consumers made the following adjustments to prior-period amounts on their consolidated statements of cash flows: InMillions YearsEndedDecember31 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Increase   (decrease) in: Cash and cash   equivalents, including restricted amounts, beginning of period $ 42 $ 32 Net cash used in   investing activities (20 ) 10 Cash and cash   equivalents, including restricted amounts, end of period 22 42 Consumers Increase   (decrease) in: Cash and cash   equivalents, including restricted amounts, beginning of period $ 41 $ 31 Net cash used in   investing activities (20 ) 10 Cash and cash   equivalents, including restricted amounts, end of period 21 41 For further information on CMSEnergys and Consumers cash balances, see Note17, Cash and Cash Equivalents.
New Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective ASU2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: This standard provides new guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. A primary objective of the standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model that will be applied across entities, industries, and capital markets. The new guidance will replace most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in GAAP, although certain guidance specific to rate-regulated utilities will be retained. The standard will be effective on January1,2018 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, but early adoption in 2017 is permitted. Entities will have the option to apply the standard retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or to apply it retrospectively only to contracts existing at the effective date, with the cumulative effect of the standard recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. CMSEnergy and Consumers have determined that they will not elect to adopt the standard early, but they are still assessing how they will apply the standard upon adoption.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are continuing to evaluate the impact of this standard on their consolidated financial statements; however, they have determined that the standard will have no impact on a majority of their revenues. The standard may require utility contributions in aid of construction to be treated as revenue, rather than as a reduction to the cost of plant, property, and equipment. Also, the standard may not permit revenue to be recognized for certain accounts for which collection is not deemed probable, which would represent a change from the existing practice of recognizing revenue at the billing rates, with associated expenses for uncollectible accounts. CMSEnergy and Consumers do not presently expect that these two issues will have a material impact on their consolidated net income, cash flows, or financial position, but they are still assessing these issues and other requirements of the standard.
98 Table of Contents ASU2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: This standard, which will be effective January1,2018 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, is intended to improve the accounting for financial instruments. The standard will require investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income, except for certain investments such as those that qualify for equity-method accounting. The standard will no longer permit unrealized gains and losses for certain equity investments to be recorded in AOCI. CMSEnergy and Consumers presently record unrealized gains and losses on certain equity investments, including the mutual funds in the DBSERP and Consumers investment in CMSEnergy common stock, in AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings. For further details on these investments, see Note7, Financial Instruments. Entities will apply the standard using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings on the effective date.
ASU2016-02, Leases: This standard establishes a new accounting model for leases. The standard will require entities to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a term of more than one year, including operating leases, which are not recorded on the balance sheet under existing standards. As a result, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to recognize additional lease assets and liabilities for their operating leases under this standard. The new guidance will also amend the definition of a lease to require that a lessee control the use of a specified asset, and not simply control or take the output of the asset. On the income statement, leases that meet existing capital lease criteria will generally be accounted for under a financing model, while operating leases will generally be accounted for under a straight-line expense model. The standard will be effective on January1,2019 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, but early adoption is permitted. CMSEnergy and Consumers are continuing to evaluate the impact of the standard on their consolidated financial statements and do not presently expect to adopt the standard early. See Note10, Leases and Palisades Financing, for more information on CMSEnergys and Consumers operating lease obligations.
ASU2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments: This standard, which will be effective January1,2020 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, provides new guidance for estimating and recording credit losses on financial instruments. The standard will apply to the recognition of loan losses at EnerBank as well as to the recognition of uncollectible accounts expense at Consumers. Entities will apply the standard using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings on the effective date. CMSEnergy and Consumers are evaluating the impact of the standard on their consolidated financial statements.
3: REGULATORY MATTERS Regulatory matters are critical to Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers, such as Consumers rate cases and PSCR and GCR processes. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders. Depending upon the specific issues, the outcomes of rate cases and proceedings, including judicial proceedings challenging MPSC orders or other actions, could negatively affect CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
There are multiple appeals pending that involve various issues concerning cost recovery from customers, the adequacy of the record evidence supporting the recovery of Smart Energy investments, and other matters. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of these appeals.
99 Table of Contents Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Consumers is subject to the actions of the MPSC and FERC and therefore prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of regulatory accounting. A utility must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, Consumers records regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by non-regulated businesses.
Presented in the following table are the regulatory assets and liabilities on Consumers consolidated balance sheets: In Millions December31 End of Recovery or Refund Period 2016 2015 Regulatory   assets Current Energy   optimization plan incentive 1 2017 $ 17 $ 16 Total current   regulatory assets $ 17 $ 16 Non-current Postretirement   benefits 2 various $ 1,373 $ 1,096 Securitized   costs 3 2029 323 348 ARO 4 various 166 151 MGP sites 4 various 139 146 Unamortized loss   on reacquired debt 4 various 54 61 Energy   optimization plan incentive 1 2018 18 18 Gas storage   inventory adjustments 4 various 14 18 Other various 4 2 Total   non-current regulatory assets $ 2,091 $ 1,840 Total regulatory   assets $ 2,108 $ 1,856 Regulatory   liabilities Current Income taxes,   net 2017 $ 64 $ 64 Reserve for   customer refunds 2017 31 18 Total current   regulatory liabilities $ 95 $ 82 Non-current Cost of removal various $ 1,809 $ 1,745 Renewable energy   plan 2028 83 109 ARO various 62 73 Renewable energy   grant 2043 58 60 Energy   optimization plan various 11 26 Income taxes,   net various 7 64 Other various 11 11 Total   non-current regulatory liabilities $ 2,041 $ 2,088 Total regulatory   liabilities $ 2,136 $ 2,170 1 These regulatory assets have arisen from an alternative revenue program and are not associated with incurred costs or capital investments. Therefore, the MPSC has provided for recovery without a return.
2 This regulatory asset is offset partially by liabilities. The net amount is included in rate base, thereby providing a return.
3 The MPSC has authorized a specific return on this regulatory asset.
100 Table of Contents 4 These regulatory assets represent incurred costs for which the MPSC has provided, or Consumers expects, recovery without a return on investment.
Regulatory Assets Energy Optimization Plan Incentive: In September2016, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to collect $18million during 2017 as an incentive for exceeding its statutory savings targets in 2015 and for achieving certain other goals. Consumers recognized incentive revenue under this program of $18million in 2015.
Consumers also exceeded its statutory savings targets in 2016, and achieved certain other goals, and will request the MPSCs approval to collect $18million, the maximum performance incentive, in the energy optimization reconciliation to be filed in 2017. Consumers recognized incentive revenue under this program of $18million in 2016.
Postretirement Benefits: As part of the ratemaking process, the MPSC allows Consumers to recover the costs of postretirement benefits. Accordingly, Consumers defers the net impact of actuarial losses and gains as well as prior service costs and credits associated with postretirement benefits as a regulatory asset or liability. The asset or liability will decrease as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
For details about the amortization periods, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Securitized Costs: In 2013, the MPSC issued a securitization financing order authorizing Consumers to issue securitization bonds in order to finance the recovery of the remaining book value of seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in April2016 and three smaller natural gas-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in June2015. Upon receipt of the MPSCs order, Consumers removed the book value of the ten units from plant, property, and equipment and recorded this amount as a regulatory asset. Consumers is amortizing the regulatory asset over the life of the related securitization bonds, which it issued through a subsidiary in 2014. For additional details regarding the securitization bonds, see Note5, Financings and Capitalization.
ARO: The recovery of the underlying asset investments and related removal and monitoring costs of recorded AROs is approved by the MPSC in depreciation rate cases. Consumers records a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability for timing differences between the recognition of AROs for financial reporting purposes and the recovery of these costs from customers. The recovery period approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed.
MGP Sites: Consumers is incurring environmental remediation and other response activity costs at 23 former MGP facilities. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover from its natural gas customers over a ten-year period the costs incurred to remediate the MGP sites.
Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt: Under regulatory accounting, any unamortized discount, premium, or expense related to debt redeemed with the proceeds of new debt is capitalized and amortized over the life of the new debt.
Gas Storage Inventory Adjustments: Consumers incurs inventory expenses related to the loss of gas from its natural gas storage fields. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover these costs from its natural gas customers over a five-year period.
Regulatory Liabilities Income Taxes, Net: These costs represent the difference between deferred income taxes recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts previously reflected in Consumers rates. This net balance will 101 Table of Contents decrease over the remaining life of the related temporary differences and flow through current income tax benefit.
In2013, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to accelerate the flow-through to electric and gas customers of certain income tax benefits associated primarily with the cost of removal of plant placed in service before 1993. The order authorized Consumers to implement a regulatory treatment beginning January2014 that will return $209million of income tax benefits over fiveyears to electric customers and $260million of income tax benefits over 12years to gas customers. During 2016, Consumers returned $64million of income tax benefits to customers.
Reserve for Customer Refunds: Consumers had recorded reserves for customer refunds of $31million at December31,2016 and $18million at December31,2015. At December31,2016, the majority of the balance related to self-implemented electric and gas rates. At December31,2015, the amount recorded included a $14million regulatory liability related to the overcollection during 2015 of surcharges related to securitization bonds that Consumers issued in 2001 and retired in 2015. Consumers refunded this amount to customers in 2016.
Cost of Removal: These amounts have been collected from customers to fund future asset removal activities.
This regulatory liability is reduced as costs of removal are incurred. The refund period of this regulatory liability approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed.
Renewable Energy Plan: Consumers has collected surcharges to fund its renewable energy plan. Amounts not yet spent under the plan are recorded as a regulatory liability, which is amortized as incremental costs are incurred to operate and depreciate Consumers wind parks and to purchase RECs under renewable energy purchase agreements. Incremental costs represent costs incurred in excess of amounts recovered through the PSCR process.
Renewable Energy Grant: In2013, Consumers received a $69million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park, which began operations in2012. This grant reduces Consumers cost of complying with Michigans renewable portfolio standard and, accordingly, reduces the overall renewable energy surcharge to be collected from customers. The regulatory liability recorded for the grant will be amortized over the life of Lake Winds  Energy Park.
Energy Optimization Plan: At December31,2016 and 2015, surcharges collected from customers to fund Consumers energy optimization plan exceeded Consumers spending. The associated regulatory liability is amortized as costs are incurred under Consumers energy optimization plan.
Consumers Electric Utility 2014 Electric Rate Case: In December2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $163million, and in June2015, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $110million, subject to refund with interest. The MPSC issued an order in November2015, authorizing an annual rate increase of $165million, based on a 10.3percent authorized rate of return on equity. In April2016, upon the retirement of seven coal-fueled electric generating units, the annual rate increase was reduced to $126million.
In February2016, Consumers filed a reconciliation of total revenues collected during self-implementation to those that would have been collected under final rates. In June2016, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement that resulted in a $1million refund to customers.
2016 Electric Rate Case: In March2016, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $225million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and 102 Table of Contents technology enhancements. Presented in the following table are the components of the requested increase in revenue: In Millions Components of   the rate increase Investment in   rate base $ 161 Operating and   maintenance costs 21 Gross margin 17 Cost of capital 15 Working capital 11 Total $ 225 The filing also seeks approval of an investment recovery mechanism that would provide for additional annual rate increases of $38million beginning in 2017, $92million beginning in 2018, and $92million beginning in 2019 for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in those years, subject to reconciliation.
In September2016, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $170million, subject to refund with interest. In October2016, Consumers reduced its requested annual rate increase to $208million. Consumers had a recorded reserve for customer refunds at December31,2016 that it believes is adequate.
Consumers Gas Utility Gas Rate Case: In July2015, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $85million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. In January2016, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $60million, subject to refund with interest. In April2016, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing a $40million annual rate increase.
In July2016, Consumers filed a reconciliation of total revenues collected during self-implementation to those that would have been collected under final rates. In November2016, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement that resulted in a $10million refund to customers, which Consumers had recorded as a reserve for customer refunds at December31,2016.
Power Supply Cost Recovery and Gas Cost Recovery The PSCR and GCR ratemaking processes are designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply and purchased natural gas costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR and GCR billing charges monthly in order to minimize the underrecovery or overrecovery amount in the annual reconciliations. Underrecoveries represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers; overrecoveries represent previously collected revenues that will be refunded to customers.
103 Table of Contents Presented in the following table are the liabilities for PSCR and GCR overrecoveries reflected on Consumers consolidated balance sheets: In Millions December31 2016 2015 Liabilities PSCR   overrecoveries $ 8 $ 8 GCR   overrecoveries 13 18 Accrued rate   refunds $ 21 $ 26 PSCR Plans and Reconciliations: In May2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2013PSCR reconciliation, approving full recovery of $1.9billion of power costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2014PSCR plan the overrecovery of $9million.
In May2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2014PSCR plan, authorizing the 2014PSCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in January2014 and then revised in July2014 following severe winter weather during the three months ended March31,2014. In July2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2014PSCR reconciliation, approving full recovery of $2.1billion of power costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2015PSCR plan the overrecovery of $5million.
In June2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2015PSCR plan, authorizing the 2015PSCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in January2015. In March2016, Consumers filed its 2015PSCR reconciliation, requesting full recovery of $1.9billion of power costs and authorization to reflect in its 2016PSCR plan the overrecovery of $6million.
In October2016, the MPSC approved Consumers 2016PSCR plan, with the exception of the recovery of litigation costs related to a complaint that Consumers filed against a rail transportation company, and adjusted the 2016 PSCR factor that Consumers self-implemented in January2016. In its order, the MPSC indicated that the litigation costs could be included for consideration in a general rate case. In connection with this disallowance, Consumers recognized a charge of $6million related to litigation costs incurred during 2015 and 2016.
GCR Plans and Reconciliations: In July2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2013-2014GCR reconciliation, approving full recovery of $0.9billion of gas costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2014-2015GCR plan the underrecovery of $84million.
In September2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2014-2015GCR reconciliation, approving full recovery of $0.8billion of gas costs and authorizing Consumers to reflect in its 2015-2016GCR plan the overrecovery of $9million.
In May2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2015-2016GCR plan, revising the 2015-2016GCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in April2015. Consumers filed its 2015-2016GCR reconciliation in June2016, requesting full recovery of $0.5billion of gas costs and authorization to reflect in its 2016-2017GCR plan the overrecovery of $2million.
In November2016, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2016-2017GCR plan, authorizing the 2016-2017GCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in April2016.
4: CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS CMSEnergy and Consumers are involved in various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. Depending on the specific issues, the resolution of these contingencies could negatively affect CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In their disclosures of these matters, CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an estimate of the possible loss or 104 Table of Contents range of loss when such an estimate can be made. Disclosures that state that CMSEnergy or Consumers cannot predict the outcome of a matter indicate that they are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss for the matter.
CMSEnergy Contingencies Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation: CMSEnergy, along with CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas,Inc., and Cantera Gas Company, have been named as defendants in four class action lawsuits and one individual lawsuit arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting to publications that report trade information. Allegations include price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The following provides more detail on the cases in which CMSEnergy or its affiliates were named as parties:  In 2005, CMSEnergy, CMSMST, and CMSField Services were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in Kansas state court, Learjet,Inc., etal. v. Oneok,Inc., etal. The complaint alleges that during the putative class period, January2000 through October2002, the defendants engaged in a scheme to violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, statutory full consideration damages consisting of the full consideration paid by the plaintiffs for natural gas purchased during the period, costs, and attorneys fees.
In 2007, a class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical Center, etal. v. Oneok,Inc. etal., was filed as a putative class action in Missouri state court alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws. The defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSField Services, and CMSMST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri antitrust law in connection with their natural gas reporting activities during the period January2000 through October2002. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, costs, and attorneys fees.
In 2006, a class action complaint, ArandellCorp., etal. v. XCELEnergyInc., etal., was filed in Wisconsin state court on behalf of Wisconsin commercial entities that purchased natural gas between January2000 and October2002. The defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSERM, and Cantera Gas Company, are alleged to have violated Wisconsins antitrust statute. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs, interest, and attorneys fees.
In 2009, a class action complaint, NewpageWisconsin System v. CMSERM, etal., was filed in circuit court in Wood County, Wisconsin, against CMSEnergy, CMSERM, Cantera Gas Company, and others. The plaintiff is seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs, interest, and attorneys fees.
In 2005, J.P.Morgan Trust Company,N.A., in its capacity as trustee of the FLILiquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas state court against CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, and others. The complaint alleges various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiff is seeking statutory full consideration damages for its purchases of natural gas in 2000 and 2001, costs, and attorneys fees.
After removal to federal court, all of the cases described above were transferred to a single federal district court pursuant to the multidistrict litigation process. In 2010 and 2011, all claims against CMSEnergy defendants were dismissed by the district court based on FERC preemption. Plaintiffs filed appeals in all of the cases. The issues on appeal were whether the district court erred in dismissing the cases based on FERC preemption and denying the plaintiffs motions for leave to amend their complaints to add a federal Sherman Act antitrust claim.
105 Table of Contents In 2013, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court decision. The appellate court found that FERC preemption does not apply under the facts of these cases. The appellate court affirmed the district courts denial of leave to amend to add federal antitrust claims. The matter was appealed to the U.S.Supreme Court, which in 2015 upheld the Ninth Circuits decision. The cases were remanded back to the federal district court. In May2016, the federal district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment in the individual lawsuit based on a release in a prior settlement involving similar allegations and reinstated CMSEnergy as a defendant in one of the class action lawsuits. The order of summary judgment has been appealed. In December2016, CMSEnergy entities reached a tentative settlement with the plaintiffs in the three Kansas and Missouri cases for an amount that was not material to CMSEnergy. Notice of the tentative settlement has been filed in the federal district court. The settlement will be subject to court approval. Other CMSEnergy entities remain as defendants in the two Wisconsin class action lawsuits.
These cases involve complex facts, a large number of similarly situated defendants with different factual positions, and multiple jurisdictions. Presently, any estimate of liability would be highly speculative; the amount of CMSEnergys reasonably possible loss would be based on widely varying models previously untested in this context. If the outcome after appeals is unfavorable, these cases could negatively affect CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Bay Harbor: CMSLand retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate, a liquid consisting of water and other substances, at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. In 2012, CMSLand and the MDEQ finalized an agreement that established the final remedies and the future water quality criteria at the site. CMSLand completed all construction necessary to implement the remedies required by the agreement and will continue to maintain and operate a system to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay under an NPDES permit issued in 2010 and renewed in October2016. The renewed NPDES permit is valid through September2020.
Various claims have been brought against CMSLand or its affiliates, including CMSEnergy, alleging environmental damage to property, loss of property value, insufficient disclosure of environmental matters, breach of agreement relating to access, or other matters. CMSLand and other parties have received a demand for payment from the EPA in the amount of $8million, plus interest. The EPA is seeking recovery under CERCLA of response costs allegedly incurred at Bay Harbor. These costs exceed what was agreed to in a 2005 order between CMSLand and the EPA, and CMSLand has communicated to the EPA that it does not believe that this is a valid claim. The EPA has filed a lawsuit to collect these costs.
At December31,2016, CMSEnergy had a recorded liability of $51million for its remaining obligations for environmental remediation. CMSEnergy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of 4.34percent and an inflation rate of onepercent on annual operating and maintenance costs. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $65million. CMSEnergy expects to pay the following amounts for long-term liquid disposal and operating and maintenance in each of the next fiveyears: In Millions 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 CMSEnergy Long-term liquid   disposal and operating and maintenance costs $ 5 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 CMSEnergys estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are changes in circumstances or assumptions used in calculating the liability. Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMSEnergy cannot predict the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter.
106 Table of Contents Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim: In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $152million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale. The matter is proceeding to formal arbitration. CMSEnergy has concluded that the governments tax claim is without merit and is contesting the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies Electric Environmental Matters: Consumers operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Historically, Consumers has generally been able to recover, in customer rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations.
Cleanup and Solid Waste: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under the NREPA. Consumers believes that these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers estimates that its liability for NREPA sites for which it can estimate a range of loss will be between $3million and $4million. At December31,2016, Consumers had a recorded liability of $3million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount.
Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under CERCLA. CERCLA liability is joint and several. In 2010, Consumers received official notification from the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party for cleanup of PCBs at the Kalamazoo River CERCLA site. The notification claimed that the EPA has reason to believe that Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. In 2011, Consumers received a follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek, which is connected to the Kalamazoo River. All parties, including Consumers, that were asked to participate in the removal action plan declined to accept liability. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river.
Based on its experience, Consumers estimates that its share of the total liability for known CERCLA sites will be between $3million and $8million. Various factors, including the number and creditworthiness of potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect Consumers share of the total liability. At December31,2016, Consumers had a recorded liability of $3million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable CERCLA liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount.
The timing of payments related to Consumers remediation and other response activities at its CERCLA and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. A change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and CERCLA liability.
Ludington PCB: In 1998, during routine maintenance activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers removed part of the PCB material and replaced it with non-PCB material. Consumers has had several communications with the EPA regarding this matter, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome.
107 Table of Contents Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies Gas Environmental Matters: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under the NREPA. These sites include 23former MGP facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites, Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a portion of the original site.
At December31,2016, Consumers had a recorded liability of $107million for its remaining obligations for these sites. This amount represents the present value of long-term projected costs, using a discount rate of 2.57percent and an inflation rate of 2.5percent. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $117million. Consumers expects to pay the following amounts for remediation and other response activity costs in each of the next fiveyears: In Millions 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Consumers Remediation and   other response activity costs $ 35 $ 14 $ 19 $ 10 $ 5 Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability.
Pursuant to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers over a ten-year period. At December31,2016, Consumers had a regulatory asset of $139million related to the MGP sites.
Consumers estimates that its liability to perform remediation and other response activities at NREPA sites other than the MGP sites could reach $3million. At December31,2016, Consumers had a recorded liability of less than $1million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable liability, as no amount in the range was considered a better estimate than any other amount.
Guarantees Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers guarantees at December31,2016: In Millions Maximum Carrying Guarantee   Description Issue Date Expiration Date Obligation Amount CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Indemnity   obligations from stock and asset sale agreements 1 Various Indefinite $ 153 $ 7 Guarantees 2 Various Indefinite 48 - Consumers Guarantee 2 July2011 Indefinite $ 30 $ - 1 These obligations arose from stock and asset sale agreements under which CMSEnergy or a subsidiary of CMSEnergy indemnified the purchaser for losses resulting from various matters, primarily claims related to taxes. CMSEnergy believes the likelihood of material loss to be remote for the indemnity obligations not recorded as liabilities.
108 Table of Contents 2 At Consumers, this obligation comprises a guarantee provided to the U.S.Department of Energy in connection with a settlement agreement regarding damages resulting from the departments failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants formerly owned by Consumers. At CMSEnergy, the guarantee obligations comprise Consumers guarantee to the U.S.Department of Energy and CMSEnergys 1994 guarantee of non-recourse revenue bonds issued by Genesee. For additional details on this guarantee, see Note20, Variable Interest Entities.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMSEnergy have entered into various agreements containing tax and other indemnity provisions for which they are unable to estimate the maximum potential obligation. The carrying value of these indemnity obligations is $1million. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to these indemnities to be remote.
Other Contingencies Michigan Sales and Use Tax Litigation: In 2010, the Michigan Department of Treasury finalized a sales and use tax audit of Consumers for the period from October1997 through December2004. It determined that Consumers electric distribution equipment and its natural gas system were not eligible for an industrial-processing exemption and therefore were subject to the use tax. Consumers paid the tax for the period from 1997 through 2004 and filed a claim in the Michigan Court of Claims disputing the tax determination. Consumers continued to apply the industrial-processing exemption for the years subsequent to 2004.
In December2015 and June2016, Consumers and the Michigan Department of Treasury reached settlements under which the Michigan Department of Treasury agreed to refund to Consumers $60million of use tax that Consumers paid on its electric distribution equipment and its natural gas system from1997 through 2015. This amount comprised a $42million refund of taxes paid, a $12million refund of interest paid, and $6million of interest owed to Consumers.
In December2015, Consumers recognized the 2015 settlement, which totaled $37million, in its consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, Consumers recorded a $12million reduction in other interest expense, $6million in interest income, and a $19million reduction in plant, property, and equipment for the portion of the taxes paid that had originally been capitalized as a cost of equipment. Consumers also recorded an additional $5million reduction in general taxes for the elimination of a loss contingency previously recorded for this matter.
In June2016, Consumers received $13million of the total settlement amount and recorded a note receivable for the remainder, of which $30million will be received in 2017 and $17million in 2018. Also in June2016, Consumers recorded a $4million reduction in maintenance and other operating expenses, and the remainder of the settlement amount as a reduction in plant, property, and equipment for the portion of the taxes paid that had originally been capitalized as a cost of equipment.
Concurrently with the June2016 sales and use tax settlement, CMSEnergy reached agreement with the Michigan Department of Treasury on two other tax matters that were under dispute relating to Michigan Corporate Income Tax and Michigan Single Business Tax. As a result, CMSEnergy recognized a $3million reduction in income tax expense and a $3million reduction in general taxes.
Other: In addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and Note3, Regulatory Matters, there are certain other lawsuits and administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies arising in the ordinary course of business to which CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMSEnergy are parties. These other lawsuits and proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage, contracts, environmental matters, federal and state taxes, rates, licensing, employment, and other matters. Further, CMSEnergy and Consumers occasionally self-report certain regulatory non-compliance matters that may or may not eventually result in administrative proceedings. CMSEnergy and Consumers 109 Table of Contents believe that the outcome of any one of these proceedings will not have a material negative effect on their consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
Contractual Commitments Purchase Obligations: Purchase obligations arise from long-term contracts for the purchase of commodities and related services, and construction and service agreements. The commodities and related services include long-term PPAs, natural gas and associated transportation, and coal and associated transportation. Related-party PPAs are between Consumers and certain affiliates of CMSEnterprises.

The MCVPPA, as amended and restated, provides for:  a capacity charge of $10.14perMWh of available capacity  a fixed energy charge based on Consumers annual average baseload coal generating plant operating and maintenance cost, fuel inventory, and administrative and general expenses  a variable energy charge based on the MCVPartnerships cost of production when the plant is dispatched  a $5million annual contribution by the MCVPartnership to a renewable resources program  an option for Consumers to extend the MCVPPA for fiveyears or purchase the MCVFacility at the conclusion of the MCVPPAs term in March2025 Capacity and energy charges under the MCVPPA were $305million in 2016, $282million in 2015, and $300million in 2014.
Palisades PPA: Consumers has a PPA expiring in 2022 with Entergy to purchase virtually all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of 798MW. For all delivered energy, the Palisades PPA has escalating capacity and variable energy charges. Total capacity and energy charges under the Palisades PPA were $363million in 2016, $352million in 2015, and $302million in 2014. In December2016, Consumers and Entergy reached an agreement to terminate the PPA in May2018, subject to timely receipt of certain MPSC approvals. The payments due reflect the original terms of the PPA.
For further details about Palisades, see Note10, Leases and Palisades Financing.
110 Table of Contents Other PPAs: Consumers has PPAs expiring through 2036 with various counterparties. The majority of the PPAs have capacity and energy charges for delivered energy. Capacity and energy charges under these PPAs were $348million in 2016, $347million in 2015, and $354million in 2014.

Consumers ability to issue first mortgage bonds is restricted by certain provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the need for regulatory approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture include achieving a two-times interest coverage ratio and having sufficient unfunded net property additions.
Term Loan: In April2016, the maturity date of CMSEnergys $180million term loan was extended by one year, through April2018.
Regulatory Authorization for Financings: Consumers is required to maintain FERC authorization for financings. In June2016, Consumers received authorization from FERC to have outstanding, at any one time, up to $800million of secured and unsecured short-term securities for general corporate purposes. At December31,2016, Consumers had entered into short-term borrowing programs allowing it to issue up to $800million in short-term securities; $398million of securities were outstanding under these programs. FERC has also authorized Consumers to issue and sell up to $1.8billion of secured and unsecured long-term securities for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability was $1.3billion at December31,2016. The authorizations were effective July1,2016 and terminate June30,2018. Any long-term issuances during the authorization period are exempt from FERCs competitive bidding and negotiated placement requirements.
Securitization Bonds: Certain regulatory assets held by Consumers subsidiary, Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding, collateralize Consumers securitization bonds. The bondholders have no recourse to Consumers assets except for those held by the subsidiary that issued the bonds. Consumers collects securitization surcharges to cover the principal and interest on the bonds as well as certain other qualified costs. The surcharges collected are remitted to a trustee and are not available to creditors of Consumers or creditors of Consumers affiliates other than the subsidiary that issued the bonds.

3 During the year ended December31,2016, CMSEnergys average borrowings totaled $3million with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.68percent. Obligations under this facility are secured by Consumers common stock.
4 Obligations under this facility are secured by first mortgage bonds of Consumers.
Short-term Borrowings: Under Consumers commercial paper program, Consumers may issue, in one or more placements, commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days and that bear interest at fixed or floating rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers $650million revolving credit facility and may have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of up to $500million. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the revolvers available capacity, Consumers does not intend to issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available revolver capacity. At December31,2016, $398million of commercial paper notes with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 1.14percent were outstanding under this program and are recorded as current notes payable on the consolidated balance sheets of CMSEnergy and Consumers.
Dividend Restrictions: At December31,2016, payment of dividends by CMSEnergy on its common stock was limited to $4.3billion under provisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act of 1972.
Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at December31,2016, Consumers had $1.0billion of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that under a variety of circumstances dividends from Consumers on its common stock would not be limited to amounts in Consumers retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay dividends on its common stock in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would be subject to a formal regulatory filing process.
114 Table of Contents For the year ended December31,2016, Consumers paid $499million in dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy.

Presented in the following table are the transactions that CMSEnergy entered into under the program: Number of Average Proceeds Shares Issued Price per Share (In Millions) 2015 888,610 $ 33.76 $ 30 2016 1,449,171 41.40 60 Total 2,337,781 $ 38.50 $ 90 Preferred Stock of Subsidiary: Presented in the following table are details about Consumers preferred stock outstanding: Optional Number of Balance Redemption Shares Outstanding Series Price Outstanding (In Millions) December31 2016 2015 Cumulative, $100   par value, authorized 7,500,000shares, with no mandatory redemption $ 4.50 $ 110.00 373,148 $ 37 $ 37 6: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. When measuring fair value, CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  Level1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other than Level1 prices. Level2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in inactive markets, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMSEnergys or Consumers own assumptions about how market participants would value their assets and liabilities.
CMSEnergy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
115 Table of Contents Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis: In Millions CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Consumers December31 2016 2015 2016 2015 Assets 1 Cash equivalents $ 44 $ 158 $ - $ - Restricted cash   equivalents 19 19 19 19 CMSEnergy   common stock - - 33 29 Nonqualified   deferred compensation plan assets 12 10 8 7 DBSERP Cash equivalents 3 2 2 2 Mutual funds 141 146 102 104 Derivative   instruments Commodity   contracts 1 1 1 1 Total $ 220 $ 336 $ 165 $ 162 Liabilities 1 Nonqualified   deferred compensation plan liabilities $ 12 $ 10 $ 8 $ 7 Total $ 12 $ 10 $ 8 $ 7 1 All assets and liabilities were classified as Level1 with the exception of some commodity contracts, which were classified as Level3.
Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents consist of money market funds with daily liquidity. Short-term debt instruments classified as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets are not included since they are recorded at amortized cost.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities: The nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of mutual funds, which are valued using the daily quoted NAVs. CMSEnergy and Consumers value their nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect what is owed to the plan participants in accordance with their investment elections. CMSEnergy and Consumers report the assets in other non-current assets and the liabilities in other non-current liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets.
DBSERP Assets: The DBSERP cash equivalents consist of a money market fund with daily liquidity. The DBSERP invests in mutual funds that hold primarily fixed-income instruments of varying maturities. In order to meet their investment objectives, the funds hold investment-grade debt securities, and may invest a portion of their assets in high-yield securities, foreign debt, and derivative instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers value these funds using the daily quoted NAVs. CMSEnergy and Consumers report their DBSERP assets in other non-current assets on their consolidated balance sheets. For additional details about DBSERP securities, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
116 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their derivative instruments using either a market approach that incorporates information from market transactions, or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount. CMSEnergy values its exchange-traded derivative contracts based on Level1 quoted prices. CMSEnergys and Consumers remaining derivatives are classified as Level3.
The majority of derivatives classified as Level3 are FTRs held by Consumers. Due to the lack of quoted pricing information, Consumers determines the fair value of its FTRs based on Consumers average historical settlements.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Level3 Inputs Presented in the following table are reconciliations of changes in the fair values of Level3 assets and liabilities at CMSEnergy and Consumers: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Balance at   beginning of period $ 1 $ 1 $ 4 Total gains   (losses) included in earnings 1 1 (1 ) - Total gains   (losses) offset through regulatory accounting (2 ) 2 (15 ) Purchases 2 1 (1 ) Settlements (1 ) (2 ) 13 Balance at end   of period $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 Consumers Balance at   beginning of period $ 1 $ 1 $ 4 Total gains   included in earnings 1 1 - - Total gains   (losses) offset through regulatory accounting (2 ) 2 (15 ) Purchases 2 - (1 ) Settlements (1 ) (2 ) 13 Balance at end   of period $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 1 CMSEnergy and Consumers record realized gains and losses for Level3 recurring fair value measurements in earnings as a component of maintenance and other operating expenses or purchased and interchange power on their consolidated statements of income.

118 Table of Contents At CMSEnergy, notes receivable consist primarily of EnerBanks fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank estimates the fair value of these loans using a discounted cash flows technique that incorporates market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining life of the loans and credit risk.
CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of their long-term debt using quoted prices from market trades of the debt, if available. In the absence of quoted prices, CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate market yields and prices for the debt using a matrix method that incorporates market data for similarly rated debt. Depending on the information available, other valuation techniques and models may be used that rely on assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions.
The effects of third-party credit enhancements are excluded from the fair value measurements of long-term debt. At December31,2016 and 2015, CMSEnergys long-term debt included $103million principal amount that was supported by third-party credit enhancements. This entire principal amount was at Consumers.
Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity: In Millions December31,2016 December31,2015 Unrealized Unrealized Fair Unrealized Unrealized Fair Cost Gains Losses Value Cost Gains Losses Value CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Available   for sale DBSERP Mutual funds $ 141 $ - $ - $ 141 $ 152 $ - $ 6 $ 146 Held to   maturity Debt securities 13 - - 13 11 - - 11 Consumers Available   for sale DBSERP Mutual funds $ 102 $ - $ - $ 102 $ 108 $ - $ 4 $ 104 CMSEnergy common stock 4 29 - 33 4 25 - 29 The mutual funds classified as available for sale hold primarily fixed-income instruments of varying maturities. Debt securities classified as held to maturity consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities and Utah Housing Corporation bonds held by EnerBank.
CMSEnergy and Consumers determined that the unrealized losses on the mutual funds in the DBSERP were other than temporary at December31,2016. Accordingly, CMSEnergy reclassified unrealized losses of $5million ($3million, net of tax) from AOCI to other expense on the consolidated statements of income and established a new cost basis of $141million for these investments, which was equal to fair value at December31,2016. Consumers reclassified net unrealized losses of $4million ($2million, net of tax) from AOCI to other expense on the consolidated statements of income and established a new cost basis of $102million for these investments, which was equal to fair value at December31,2016.
119 Table of Contents Presented in the following table is a summary of the sales activity for CMSEnergys and Consumers investment securities: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Proceeds from   sales of investment securities $ 6 $ 3 $ 8 Consumers Proceeds from   sales of investment securities $ 4 $ 2 $ 6 The sales proceeds for all periods represent sales of investments that were held within the DBSERP and classified as available for sale. Realized gains and losses on the sales were insignificant for CMSEnergy and Consumers during each period.
Consumers recognized a gain of $9million in 2015 from transferring shares of CMSEnergy common stock to a related charitable foundation. The gains reflected the excess of fair value over cost of the stock donated and were recorded in other income on Consumers consolidated statements of income. The gains were eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income. Consumers did not transfer shares in 2016 or 2014.
8: NOTES RECEIVABLE Presented in the following table are details of CMSEnergys and Consumers current and non-current notes receivable: In Millions December31 2016 2015 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Current EnerBank notes   receivable, net of allowance for loan losses $ 151 $ 128 EnerBank notes   receivable held for sale 39 16 State of   Michigan tax settlement 29 - Non-current EnerBank notes   receivable 1,088 1,017 State of   Michigan tax settlement 19 - Total notes   receivable $ 1,326 $ 1,161 Consumers Current State of   Michigan tax settlement $ 29 $ - Non-current State of   Michigan tax settlement 16 - Total notes   receivable $ 45 $ - 120 Table of Contents EnerBank notes receivable are unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank records its notes receivable at cost, less an allowance for loan losses. At December31,2016, $39million of notes receivable were classified as held for sale; the fair value of notes receivable held for sale exceeded their carrying value. These notes are expected to be sold in 2017.
Unearned income associated with loan fees was $84million at December31,2016 and $82million at December31,2015. Unearned income associated with loan fees for notes receivable held for sale was $8million at December31,2016 and $3million at December31,2015.
The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to reflect estimated credit losses. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance required by taking into consideration historical loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the loss is confirmed, but no later than the point at which a loan becomes 120days past due.
Presented in the following table are the changes in the allowance for loan losses: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 Balance at   beginning of period $ 9 $ 8 Charge-offs (14 ) (8 ) Recoveries 2 1 Provision for   loan losses 19 8 Balance at end   of period $ 16 $ 9 Loans that are 30days or more past due are considered delinquent. The balance of EnerBanks delinquent consumer loans was $11million at December31,2016 and $8million at December31,2015.
At December31,2016 and 2015, $1million of EnerBanks loans had been modified as troubled debt restructurings.
121 Table of Contents 9: PLANT, PROPERTY, AND EQUIPMENT Presented in the following table are details of CMSEnergys and Consumers plant, property, and equipment: In Millions December31 Estimated Depreciable Life in Years 2016 2015 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Plant,   property, and equipment, gross Consumers 5 - 125 $ 20,838 $ 18,797 Enterprises Independent   power production 3 - 30 141 95 Other 3 - 40 16 25 Other 1 - 7 15 26 Plant, property,   and equipment, gross $ 21,010 $ 18,943 Construction   work in progress 761 1,509 Less accumulated   depreciation and amortization (6,056 ) (5,747 ) Total plant,   property, and equipment 1 $ 15,715 $ 14,705 Consumers Plant,   property, and equipment, gross Electric Generation 22 - 125 $ 5,900 $ 4,925 Distribution 20 - 75 7,149 6,809 Transmission 46 - 75 59 - Other 5 - 50 1,137 1,039 Assets under   capital leases and financing obligation 295 286 Gas Distribution 28 - 80 3,806 3,497 Transmission 17 - 75 1,124 981 Underground   storage facilities 2 29 - 65 630 601 Other 5 - 50 708 630 Capital leases 15 14 Other   non-utility property 8 - 51 15 15 Plant, property,   and equipment, gross $ 20,838 $ 18,797 Construction   work in progress 759 1,467 Less accumulated   depreciation and amortization (5,994 ) (5,676 ) Total plant,   property, and equipment 1 $ 15,603 $ 14,588 1 For the year ended December31,2016, Consumers plant additions were $2.3billion and plant retirements were $285million. For the year ended December31,2015, Consumers plant additions were $1.4billion and plant retirements were $187million.
2 Underground storage includes base natural gas of $26million at December31,2016 and 2015. Base natural gas is not subject to depreciation.
Capitalization: CMSEnergy and Consumers record plant, property, and equipment at original cost when placed into service. The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, overhead such as pension and other benefits, and AFUDC, if applicable. Consumers plant, property, and equipment is generally recoverable through its general rate making process.
With the exception of utility property for which the remaining book value has been securitized, mothballed utility property stays in rate base and continues to be depreciated at the same rate as before the 122 Table of Contents mothball period. When utility property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal, net of salvage. CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. Consumers records cost of removal collected from customers, but not spent, as a regulatory liability.
Software : CMSEnergy and Consumers capitalize the costs to purchase and develop internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed evenly over the estimated useful life of the internal-use computer software. If computer software is integral to computer hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the hardware.
AFUDC : Consumers capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction projects, except pollution control facilities on its fossil-fuel-fired power plants. AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and authorized return-on-equity funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers records the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed funds component and as other income for the equity funds component on the consolidated statements of income. When construction is completed and the property is placed in service, Consumers depreciates and recovers the capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of the related asset. Presented in the following table are Consumers composite AFUDC capitalization rates: Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 AFUDC   capitalization rate 7.0 % 7.1 % 7.2 % Electric Transmission: In October2015, Consumers became registered under NERC standards as a transmission owner, transmission planner, and transmission operator. Consumers had previously received approval from the MPSC in 2014 and from FERC in 2015 to reclassify $34million of net plant assets from distribution to transmission. In March2016, Consumers received FERC approval to begin collecting transmission revenues under MISOs transmission tariff effective April2016. Consumers completed the reclassification of plant assets from distribution to transmission in April2016.
Electric Plant Purchase: In December2015, Consumers completed the purchase of a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant located in Jackson, Michigan for $155million from AlphaGen PowerLLC and DPC Juniper,LLC, affiliates of JPMorgan Chase&Co. Consumers purchased the plant to help address its future capacity requirements.
Consumers accounted for the purchase as a business combination and prepared a valuation analysis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to determine their fair values. The cash consideration of $155million was allocated based on the underlying fair values of the assets acquired, which were primarily plant, property, and equipment, and the liabilities assumed. No goodwill was recorded as a result of this purchase. The pro forma results of operations have not been presented, as the effects of the acquisition would not have been material to CMSEnergys or Consumers consolidated results of operations in 2015.
Assets Under Capital Leases and Financing Obligation : Presented in the following table are further details about changes in Consumers assets under capital leases and financing obligation: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 Consumers Balance at   beginning of period $ 300 $ 295 Additions 13 17 Net retirements   and other adjustments (3 ) (12 ) Balance at end   of period $ 310 $ 300 123 Table of Contents Assets under capital leases and financing obligation are presented as gross amounts. Accumulated amortization of assets under capital leases and financing obligation was $172million at December31,2016 and $152million at December31,2015 for Consumers.

Consumers shares operation, maintenance, and other expenses of these jointly owned utility facilities in proportion to each participants undivided ownership interest. Consumers is required to provide only its share of financing for the jointly owned utility facilities.
10: LEASES AND PALISADES FINANCING CMSEnergy and Consumers lease various assets, including railcars, service vehicles, gas pipeline capacity, and buildings. In addition, CMSEnergy and Consumers account for a number of their PPAs as capital and operating leases.
Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have original lease terms ranging from one to 15years, expiring without extension provisions over the next sevenyears and with extension provisions over the next tenyears. These leases contain fair market value extension and buyout provisions. Capital leases for Consumers vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of 120months with some having end-of-lease rental adjustment clauses based on the proceeds received from the sale or disposition of the vehicles, and others having fixed-percentage purchase options.
Consumers has capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the D.E.Karn generating complex and Zeeland. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the D.E.Karn generating complex has a term of 15years with a provision to extend the contract from month to month. The remaining term of the contract was fiveyears at December31,2016. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline to Zeeland has a term of fiveyears with a renewal provision of an additional fiveyears at the end of the contract. The remaining term of the contract was oneyear at December31,2016. The remaining terms of Consumers long-term PPAs accounted for as leases range between one and 16years. Most of these PPAs contain provisions at the end of the initial contract terms to renew the agreements annually.
Presented in the following table are Consumers minimum lease expense and contingent rental expense. For each of the years ended December31,2016, 2015, and 2014, all of CMSEnergys minimum lease expense and contingent rental expense were attributable to Consumers.

Consumers accounted for this transaction as a financing because of its continuing involvement with Palisades through security provided to Entergy for the PPA obligation and other arrangements. Palisades has therefore remained on Consumers consolidated balance sheets and Consumers has continued to depreciate it. At the time of the sale, Consumers recorded the sales proceeds as a financing obligation, and has subsequently recorded a portion of the payments under the PPA as interest expense and as a reduction of the financing obligation. Total amortization and interest charges under the financing were $17million for the year ended December31,2016, $18million for the year ended December31,2015, and $19million for the year ended December31,2014. At December31,2016, the Palisades asset and financing obligation both had a balance of $69million.
The prices that Consumers pays under the PPA, and which it recovers from its electric customers through the PSCR, are presently higher than the cost to purchase electricity from the market. In December2016, Consumers and Entergy reached an agreement to terminate the PPA in May2018. In exchange for early termination, Consumers agreed to pay Entergy $172million on the termination date.
The agreement is contingent upon Consumers receipt of an MPSC order authorizing it to recover the termination payment from its electric customers. Consumers has indicated to the MPSC that it plans to request authorization to recover the termination payment through securitization. In an order issued in January2017, the MPSC indicated that it will make a final determination on the securitization filing by September2017, after full evaluation of the prudency of the termination payment and of how the termination will impact Michigans electric reliability and resource adequacy. If the MPSC does not approve Consumers request by September30,2017, the agreement will be null and void (unless otherwise extended) and the PPA will continue until April2022 under its original terms. The amounts shown in the table above reflect the original terms of the PPA.
127 Table of Contents Because Consumers accounted for its sale of Palisades to Entergy as a financing transaction, the early termination of the PPA represents a substantial modification of the terms of an existing debt instrument, and Consumers will therefore account for the termination agreement as an extinguishment of debt. Accordingly, in the period in which the termination agreement becomes effective, Consumers will remove from its consolidated balance sheets the existing financing obligation and will record a new financing obligation and a regulatory asset. Consumers will amortize the new financing obligation and will continue to depreciate the Palisades asset until the date of the PPA termination in May2018 (assuming such termination occurs), when it will recognize the sale of Palisades.
11: ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS CMSEnergy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMSEnergy and Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.
CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected present-value technique that reflects assumptions about costs and inflation, and uses a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the expected cash flows. CMSEnergys ARO liabilities are primarily at Consumers. As a regulated entity, Consumers defers the effects of any changes in assumptions on the fair values of its ARO liabilities, adjusting the associated regulatory assets or liabilities rather than recognizing such effects in earnings.
Presented below are the categories of assets that CMSEnergy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove at the end of their useful lives and for which they have an ARO liability recorded: CompanyandARODescription In-ServiceDate Long-LivedAssets CMSEnergy, including Consumers Closure of gas treating plant and gas wells Various Gas transmission and   storage Closure of coal ash disposal areas Various Generating plants coal   ash areas Gas distribution cut, purge, and cap Various Gas distribution mains   and services Asbestos abatement 1973 Electric and gas   utility plant Closure of renewable generation assets 2012, 2014, 2016 Wind and solar   generation facilities Consumers Closure of coal ash disposal areas Various Generating plants coal   ash areas Gas distribution cut, purge, and cap Various Gas distribution mains   and services Asbestos abatement 1973 Electric and gas   utility plant Closure of renewable generation assets 2012, 2014, 2016 Wind and solar   generation facilities No assets have been restricted for purposes of settling AROs.

129 Table of Contents 12: RETIREMENT BENEFITS Benefit Plans: CMSEnergy and Consumers provide pension, OPEB, and other retirement benefits to employees under a number of different plans. These plans include:  a non-contributory, qualified DBPension Plan (closed to new non-union participants as of July1,2003 and closed to new union participants as of September1,2005)  a qualified Cash Balance Pension Plan for certain employees hired between July1,2003 and August31,2005  a non-contributory, qualified DCCP for employees hired on or after September1,2005  benefits to certain management employees under a non-contributory, nonqualified DBSERP (closed to new participants as of March31,2006)  a non-contributory, nonqualified DCSERP for certain management employees hired or promoted on or after April1,2006  a contributory, qualified defined contribution 401(k)plan  health care and life insurance benefits under an OPEB Plan DBPension Plan: Participants in the DBPension Plan include present and former employees of CMSEnergy and Consumers, including certain present and former affiliates and subsidiaries. DBPension Plan trust assets are not distinguishable by company.
DCCP and Cash Balance Pension Plan: CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an employer contribution to the DCCP401(k)plan for employees hired on or after September1,2005. The contribution ranges from five to seven percent of base pay, depending on years of service. Employees are not required to contribute in order to receive the plans employer contribution.
Participants in the Cash Balance Pension Plan, effective July1,2003 to August31,2005, also participate in the DCCP as of September1,2005. Additional pay credits under the Cash Balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of September 1,2005. DCCP expense for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, was $20million for the year ended December31,2016, $16million for the year ended December31,2015, and $13million for the year ended December31,2014. DCCP expense for Consumers was $19million for the year ended December31,2016, $16million for the year ended December31,2015, and $13million for the year ended December31,2014.
DBSERP: The DBSERP is a nonqualified plan as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. DBSERP benefits are paid from a rabbi trust established in 1988. DBSERP rabbi trust earnings are taxable. Presented in the following table are the fair values of trust assets, ABO, and contributions for CMSEnergys and Consumers DBSERP: InMillions YearsEndedDecember31 2016 2015 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Trust assets $ 144 $ 148 ABO 143 140 Contributions - 25 Consumers Trust assets $ 104 $ 106 ABO 101 97 Contributions - 17 130 Table of Contents DCSERP: On April1,2006, CMSEnergy and Consumers implemented a DCSERP and froze further new participation in the DBSERP. The DCSERP provides participants benefits ranging from 5percent to 15percent of total compensation. The DCSERP requires a minimum of fiveyears of participation before vesting. CMSEnergys and Consumers contributions to the plan, if any, are placed in a grantor trust. For CMSEnergy and Consumers, trust assets were $3million and $2million at December31,2016 and 2015. DCSERP assets are included in other non-current assets on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated balance sheets. CMSEnergys and Consumers DCSERP expense was less than $1million for each of the years ended December31,2016, 2015, and 2014.
401(k)Plan: The 401(k)plan employer match equals 100percent of eligible contributions up to the first threepercent of an employees wages and 50percent of eligible contributions up to the next twopercent of an employees wages. The total 401(k)plan cost for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, was $24million for the year ended December31,2016, $19million for the year ended December31,2015, and $ 18million for the year ended December31,2014. The total 401(k)plan cost for Consumers was $23million for the year ended December31,2016, $19million for the year ended December31,2015, and $18million for the year ended December31,2014.
OPEB Plan: Participants in the OPEB Plan include all regular full-time employees covered by the employee health care plan on the day before retirement from either CMSEnergy or Consumers at age 55 or older with at least ten full years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees who qualify for DBPension Plan disability retirement or are disabled and covered by the DCCP and who have 15years of applicable continuous service may also participate in the OPEB Plan. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption that costs would increase 7.00percent in 2017 and 7.25percent in 2016 for those under 65 and would increase 7.75percent in 2017 and 8.00percent in 2016 for those over 65. The rate of increase was assumed to decline to 4.75percent by 2027 and thereafter for all retirees.
The assumptions used in the health care cost-trend rate affect service, interest, and PBO costs. Presented in the following table are the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the health care cost-trend assumption: InMillions OnePercentage OnePercentage YearEndedDecember31,2016 PointIncrease PointDecrease CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Effect on total   service and interest cost component $ 13 $ (10 ) Effect on PBO 201 (163 ) Consumers Effect on total   service and interest cost component $ 13 $ (10 ) Effect on PBO 196 (159 ) 131 Table of Contents Assumptions: Presented in the following table are the weighted-average assumptions used in CMSEnergys and Consumers retirement benefits plans to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost: December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Weighted   average for benefit obligations 1 Discount   rate 2,3 DBPension   Plan 4.30 % 4.52 % 4.10 % DBSERP 4.16 4.43 4.10 OPEB Plan 4.49 4.70 4.30 Rate of   compensation increase DBPension   Plan 3.60 3.00 3.00 DBSERP 5.50 5.50 5.50 Weighted   average for net periodic benefit cost 1 Service   cost discount rate 2,3 DBPension   Plan 4.79 4.10 4.90 DBSERP 4.87 4.10 4.90 OPEB Plan 4.75 4.30 5.10 Interest   cost discount rate 2,3 DBPension   Plan 3.66 4.10 4.90 DBSERP 3.64 4.10 4.90 OPEB Plan 3.89 4.30 5.10 Expected   long-term rate of return on plan assets 4 DBPension   Plan 7.25 7.50 7.50 OPEB Plan 7.25 7.25 7.25 Rate of   compensation increase DBPension   Plan 3.00 3.00 3.00 DBSERP 5.50 5.50 5.50 1 The mortality assumption for benefit obligations was based on the RP-2014 mortality table, with projection scales MP-2016 for 2016, MP-2015 for 2015, and MP-2014 for 2014. The mortality assumption for net periodic benefit cost for 2016 and 2015 was based on the RP-2014 mortality table, with projection scales MP-2015 for 2016 and MP-2014 for 2015, and for 2014 was based on the RP-2000 mortality table.
2 The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from a yield-curve analysis. This analysis incorporated the projected benefit payments specific to CMSEnergys and Consumers DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan and the yields on high-quality corporate bonds rated Aa or better.
3 In January2016, CMSEnergy and Consumers changed the method they use to determine the discount rate used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans. Historically, the discount rate used for this purpose represented a single weighted-average rate derived from the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation. CMSEnergy and Consumers have elected to use instead a full-yield-curve approach in the estimation of service cost and interest cost; this approach is more accurate in that it applies individual spot rates along the yield curve to future projected benefit payments based on the time of payment. This change represented a change in accounting estimate and did not impact years prior to 2016. As a result of changing to the full-yield-curve approach to determine the discount rate, for the year ended December31,2016, the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs were reduced by $23million for the DBPension Plan and $12million for the OPEB Plan for CMSEnergy and by $22million for the DBPension Plan and $11million for the OPEB Plan for Consumers.
132 Table of Contents 4 CMSEnergy and Consumers determined the long-term rate of return using historical market returns, the present and expected future economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with financial market knowledge. CMSEnergy and Consumers considered the asset allocation of the portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of the portfolio. The goal was to determine a long-term rate of return that could be incorporated into the planning of future cash flow requirements in conjunction with the change in the liability. Annually, CMSEnergy and Consumers review for reasonableness and appropriateness the forecasted returns for various classes of assets used to construct an expected return model. CMSEnergys and Consumers expected long-term rate of return on DBPension Plan assets was 7.25percent in 2016. The actual return (loss) on DBPension Plan assets was 8.0percent in 2016, (2.0)percent in 2015, and 7.4percent in 2014.

The estimated period of amortization of gains and losses for CMSEnergy and Consumers was tenyears for the DBPension Plan for the years ended December31,2016, 2015, and 2014 and for the OPEB Plan was 11years for the year ended December31,2016 and 13years for the years ended December31,2015 and 2014. Prior service cost (credit) amortization is established in the year in which the prior service cost (credit) first occurred, and is based on the same amortization period for all future years until the prior service cost (credit) is fully amortized. CMSEnergy and Consumers had a new prior service credit for OPEB in 2015 and new prior 133 Table of Contents service cost for the DBPension Plan in 2015. The estimated period of amortization of these new prior service costs (credits) for CMSEnergy and Consumers is tenyears.
CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for DBPension Plan assets as the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMSEnergy and Consumers reflect each years gain or loss in the MRV in equal amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was determined. CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for OPEB Plan assets as the fair value of assets on the measurement date.

U.S.Government and Agencies Securities: U.S.government and agencies securities consist of U.S.Treasury notes and other debt securities backed by the U.S.government and related agencies. These securities were valued based on quoted market prices.
Corporate Debt: Corporate debt investments consisted of investment grade bonds of U.S.issuers from diverse industries. These securities are valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or yields presently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
State and Municipal Bonds: State and municipal bonds were valued using a matrix-pricing model that incorporates Level2 market-based information. The fair value of the bonds was derived from various observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported securities trades, broker/dealer quotes, bond 137 Table of Contents ratings, and general information on market movements for investment grade state and municipal securities normally considered by market participants when pricing such debt securities.
Foreign Corporate Bonds: Foreign corporate debt securities were valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or on yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
Common Stocks: Common stocks in the OPEB Plan consist of equity securities with low transaction costs that were actively managed and tracked by the S&P500 Index. These securities were valued at their quoted closing prices.
Mutual Funds: Mutual funds represent shares in registered investment companies that are priced based on the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in the funds.
Pooled Funds: Pooled funds include both common and collective trust funds as well as special funds that contain only employee benefit plan assets from two or more unrelated benefit plans. Presented in the following table are the investment components of these funds: DBPension Plan OPEB Plan December31 2016 2015 2016 2015 U.S. equity   securities 67 % 62 % 72 % 58 % Foreign equity   securities 16 18 13 13 U.S.   fixed-income securities 9 11 8 22 Foreign   fixed-income securities 4 6 4 5 Alternative   investments 4 3 3 2 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Since these investments were valued at their NAV as a practical expedient, they are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.
Target Asset Allocations: CMSEnergys target asset allocation for DBPension Plan assets is 53percent equity, 32percent fixed income, and 15percent alternative-strategy investments. This target asset allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&P MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers as well as high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are diversified across absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset allocation. CMSEnergy uses annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocation.
CMSEnergy established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries. CMSEnergys target asset allocation for the health trusts is 50percent equity, 30percent fixed income, and 20percent alternative-strategy investments. CMSEnergys target asset allocation for the life trusts is 42percent equity, 28percent fixed income, and 30percent alternative-strategy investments. These target allocations are expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plans. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&PSmallCap Index and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers. Alternative strategies are diversified across absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset allocation. CMSEnergy uses annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocation.

Neither CMSEnergy nor Consumers plans to contribute to the OPEB or DBPension Plans in 2017. Actual future contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan participants.
Following amendments to the OPEB Plan in July2013, Consumers OPEB costs decreased substantially and, as a result, the OPEB Plan was fully funded at December31,2013. In May2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC requesting approval to suspend contributions to Consumers OPEB Plan during 2014 and 2015 if the OPEB Plan continued to be fully funded. Consumers electric and gas rates still reflect the higher OPEB costs, and previous MPSC orders required Consumers to contribute to the OPEB Plan the associated amount collected in rates annually.
In September2014, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement addressing Consumers OPEB Plan funding application. Under the settlement agreement, Consumers contributed $25million to the plan in 2014 and $29million in February2015. Consumers will suspend further contributions until the MPSC determines funding requirements in future general rate cases.

The UWUA represents Consumers operating, maintenance, construction, and call center employees. The USW represents Zeeland employees. Union contracts expire in 2020.
139 Table of Contents 13: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CMSEnergy and Consumers provide a PISP to officers, employees, and non-employee directors based on their contributions to the successful management of the company. The PISP has a ten-year term, expiring in May2024.
In 2016, all awards were in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units. The PISP also allows for unrestricted common stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, performance units, and incentive options, none of which was granted in 2016, 2015, or 2014.
Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or performance units may not exceed 6.5million shares from June2014 through May2024, nor may such awards to any recipient exceed 500,000shares in any calendar year. CMSEnergy and Consumers may issue awards of up to 4,983,931shares of common stock under the PISP as of December31,2016. Shares for which payment or exercise is in cash, as well as shares that expire, terminate, or are cancelled or forfeited, may be awarded or granted again under the PISP.
All awards under the PISP vest fully upon death. Upon a change of control of CMSEnergy or termination under an officer separation agreement, the awards will vest in accordance with specific officer agreements. If stated in the award, for restricted stock recipients who terminate employment due to retirement or disability, a pro-rata portion of the award will vest upon termination, with any market-based award also contingent upon the outcome of the market condition and any performance-based award contingent upon the outcome of the performance condition. The pro-rata portion is equal to the portion of the service period served between the award grant date and the employees termination date. The remaining portion of the awards will be forfeited. All awards for directors vest fully upon retirement. Restricted shares may be forfeited if employment terminates for any other reason or if the minimum service requirements are not met, as described in the award document.
Restricted Stock Awards: Restricted stock awards for employees under the PISP are in the form of performance-based, market-based, and time-lapse restricted stock. Award recipients receive shares of CMSEnergy common stock that have dividend and voting rights. The dividends on time-lapse restricted stock are paid in cash or in CMSEnergy common stock. The dividends on performance-based and market-based restricted stock are paid in restricted shares equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted shares are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying restricted stock shares.
Performance-based restricted stock vesting is contingent on meeting at least a 36-month service requirement and a performance condition. The performance condition is based on an adjusted measure of CMSEnergys EPS growth relative to a peer group over a three-year period. The awards granted in 2016, 2015, and 2014 require a 38-month service period. Market-based restricted stock vesting is generally contingent on meeting a three-year service requirement and a market condition. The market condition is based on a comparison of CMSEnergys total shareholder return with the median total shareholder return of a peer group over the same three-year period. Depending on the outcome of the performance condition or the market condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero to 200percent of the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock generally vests after a service period of threeyears.
Restricted Stock Units: In 2016 and 2015, CMSEnergy and Consumers granted restricted stock units to certain non-employee directors who elected to defer their restricted stock awards. The restricted stock units generally vest after a service period of one year or, if earlier, at the next annual meeting. The restricted stock units will be distributed to the recipients as shares in accordance with the directors deferral agreements. Restricted stock units do not have voting rights, but do have dividend rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, the dividends on restricted stock units are paid in additional units equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted stock units are subject to the same vesting and 140 Table of Contents distribution conditions as the underlying restricted stock units. No restricted stock units were forfeited during 2016.
Presented in the following tables is the activity for restricted stock and restricted stock units under the 2009 and 2014 PISPs: CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Consumers Year Ended   December31,2016 Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant DateFair Value per Share Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant DateFair Value per Share Nonvested at   beginning of period 1,624,934 $ 29.08 1,557,657 $ 29.06 Granted Restricted stock 826,075 31.74 786,328 31.77 Restricted stock   units 15,338 39.12 14,907 39.12 Vested Restricted stock (819,658 ) 24.37 (782,505 ) 24.39 Restricted stock   units (13,588 ) 33.22 (13,233 ) 33.23 Forfeited -   restricted stock (245,504 ) 35.18 (234,523 ) 35.17 Nonvested at end   of period 1,387,597 $ 32.44 1,328,631 $ 32.41 Year Ended December31,2016 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Consumers Granted Time-lapse   awards 188,303 180,958 Market-based   awards 185,464 175,818 Performance-based   awards 185,464 175,818 Restricted stock   units 14,595 14,186 Dividends on   market-based awards 38,652 36,646 Dividends on   performance-based awards 14,438 13,704 Dividends on   restricted stock units 743 721 Additional   market-based shares based on achievement of condition 213,754 203,384 Total granted 841,413 801,235 CMSEnergy and Consumers charge the fair value of the restricted stock awards to expense over the required service period and charge the fair value of the restricted stock units to expense immediately. For performance-based awards, CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the number of shares expected to vest at the end of the performance period based on the probable achievement of the performance objective. Performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards have graded vesting features for retirement-eligible employees, and CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize expense for those awards on a graded vesting schedule over the required service period. Expense for performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards for non-retirement-eligible employees and time-lapse awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period.
The fair value of performance-based and time-lapse restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the price of CMSEnergys common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based restricted stock awards is calculated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMSEnergy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMSEnergy common stock. The risk-free rate for valuation of the market-based restricted stock awards was based on the three-year U.S.Treasury yield at the award grant date.
141 Table of Contents Presented in the following table are the most important assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the market-based restricted stock awards: Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 Expected   volatility 16.7 % 14.1 % 15.6 % Expected   dividend yield 3.2 3.3 3.7 Risk-free rate 1.0 0.8 0.8 Presented in the following table is the weighted-average grant-date fair value of all awards under the PISP: Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Weighted-average   grant-date fair value per share Restricted stock   granted $ 31.74 $ 36.84 $ 26.15 Restricted stock   units granted 39.12 34.25 - Consumers Weighted-average   grant-date fair value per share Restricted stock   granted $ 31.77 $ 36.83 $ 26.18 Restricted stock   units granted 39.12 34.25 - Presented in the following table are amounts related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Fair value of   shares that vested during the year $ 31 $ 29 $ 16 Compensation   expense recognized 16 20 14 Income tax   benefit recognized 7 8 5 Consumers Fair value of   shares that vested during the year $ 30 $ 28 $ 15 Compensation   expense recognized 16 19 13 Income tax   benefit recognized 6 7 5 At December31,2016, $15million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, and $14million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for Consumers. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 1.8years.
142 Table of Contents 14: INCOME TAXES CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and a unitary Michigan income tax return. Income taxes are allocated based on each companys separate taxable income in accordance with the CMSEnergy tax sharing agreement.
Presented in the following table is the difference between actual income tax expense on continuing operations and income tax expense computed by applying the statutory U.S.federal income tax rate: In Millions, Except Tax Rate Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Income from   continuing operations before income taxes $ 826 $ 796 $ 729 Income tax   expense at statutory rate 289 279 255 Increase   (decrease) in income taxes from: State and local   income taxes, net of federal effect 37 39 36 Accelerated   flow-through of regulatory tax benefits 1 (39 ) (39 ) (39 ) Employee   share-based awards 2 (7 ) - - Other, net (7 ) (8 ) (2 ) Income tax   expense $ 273 $ 271 $ 250 Effective tax   rate 33.1 % 34.0 % 34.3 % Consumers Income from   continuing operations before income taxes $ 936 $ 896 $ 873 Income tax   expense at statutory rate 328 314 306 Increase   (decrease) in income taxes from: State and local   income taxes, net of federal effect 44 42 42 Accelerated   flow-through of regulatory tax benefits 1 (39 ) (39 ) (39 ) Employee   share-based awards 2 (6 ) - - Other, net (7 ) (15 ) (3 ) Income tax   expense $ 320 $ 302 $ 306 Effective tax   rate 34.2 % 33.7 % 35.1 % 1 Since 2014, Consumers has followed a regulatory treatment ordered by the MPSC that accelerates the return of certain income tax benefits to customers. This change, which also accelerates Consumers recognition of the income tax benefits, reduced Consumers income tax expense by $39million for each of the years ended December31,2016,2015, and 2014.
2 CMSEnergy and Consumers elected to adopt ASU2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , as of January1,2016. For further details on the implementation of this standard, see Note2, New Accounting Standards.
143 Table of Contents Presented in the following table are the significant components of income tax expense on continuing operations: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Current   income taxes Federal $ - $ - $ - State and local 9 24 24 $ 9 $ 24 $ 24 Deferred   income taxes Federal $ 200 $ 192 $ 198 State and local 47 36 31 $ 247 $ 228 $ 229 Deferred income   tax credit 17 19 (3 ) Tax expense $ 273 $ 271 $ 250 Consumers Current   income taxes Federal $ 9 $ 66 $ 8 State and local 22 32 36 $ 31 $ 98 $ 44 Deferred   income taxes Federal $ 227 $ 153 $ 236 State and local 45 32 29 $ 272 $ 185 $ 265 Deferred income   tax credit 17 19 (3 ) Tax expense $ 320 $ 302 $ 306 144 Table of Contents Presented in the following table are the principal components of deferred income tax assets (liabilities) recognized: In Millions December31 2016 2015 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Employee   benefits $ (158 ) $ (127 ) Gas inventory (65 ) (96 ) Plant, property,   and equipment (2,902 ) (2,429 ) Net regulatory   tax liability 27 50 Reserves and   accruals 69 59 Securitized   costs (118 ) (122 ) Tax loss and   credit carryforwards 871 657 Other (6 ) (5 ) $ (2,282 ) $ (2,013 ) Less valuation   allowance (5 ) (4 ) Total net   deferred income tax liabilities $ (2,287 ) $ (2,017 ) Deferred tax   assets, net of valuation reserves $ 962 $ 762 Deferred tax   liabilities (3,249 ) (2,779 ) Total net   deferred income tax liabilities $ (2,287 ) $ (2,017 ) Consumers Employee   benefits $ (181 ) $ (156 ) Gas inventory (65 ) (96 ) Plant, property,   and equipment (2,924 ) (2,457 ) Net regulatory   tax liability 27 50 Reserves and   accruals 37 30 Securitized   costs (118 ) (122 ) Tax loss and   credit carryforwards 190 46 Other (8 ) (5 ) Total net deferred   income tax liabilities $ (3,042 ) $ (2,710 ) Deferred tax   assets, net of valuation reserves $ 254 $ 126 Deferred tax   liabilities (3,296 ) (2,836 ) Total net   deferred income tax liabilities $ (3,042 ) $ (2,710 ) Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated financial statements.
Presented in the following table are the tax loss and credit carryforwards at December31,2016: In Millions Gross Amount Tax Attribute Expiration CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Federal net   operating loss carryforward $ 1,415 $ 495 2025  2036 Local net operating   loss carryforwards 408 4 2023  2036 Alternative   minimum tax credits 270 270 No expiration General business   credits 102 102 2018  2036 Total tax   attributes $ 871 Consumers Federal net   operating loss carryforward $ 447 $ 157 2025  2036 General business   credits 33 33 2032  2036 Total tax   attributes $ 190 145 Table of Contents CMSEnergy has provided a valuation allowance of $2million for the local tax loss carryforward, and $3million for general business credits. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to utilize fully tax loss and credit carryforwards for which no valuation allowance has been provided. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments will be made to the valuation allowances within one year.
Presented in the following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax benefits: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Balance at   beginning of period $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 Additions for current-year   tax positions - 1 2 Additions for   prior-year tax positions - 1 1 Reductions for   prior-year tax positions - (1 ) (2 ) Settlements (1 ) - - Balance at end   of period $ 5 $ 6 $ 5 Consumers Balance at   beginning of period $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 Additions for   current-year tax positions - 1 2 Additions for   prior-year tax positions - 1 1 Reductions for   prior-year tax positions - (1 ) (2 ) Settlements (1 ) - - Balance at end   of period $ 5 $ 6 $ 5 If recognized, all of these uncertain tax benefits would affect CMSEnergys and Consumers annual effective tax rates in future years.
CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and penalties, where applicable, as part of income tax expense. CMSEnergy, including Consumers, recognized no interest or penalties for the years ended December31,2016, 2015, or 2014.
In April2014, the IRS completed its audit of the federal income tax returns of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries for 2010 and 2011. The audit resulted in no significant adjustments to CMSEnergys or Consumers taxable income or income tax expense.
CMSEnergys federal income tax returns for 2013 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. CMSEnergys Michigan Corporate Income Tax and Michigan Business Tax returns for 2008 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the State of Michigan.
The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. CMSEnergys and Consumers estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that their accrued tax liabilities at December31,2016 were adequate for all years.
146 Table of Contents 15: EARNINGS PER SHARECMSENERGY Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys basic and diluted EPS computations based on net income: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Years Ended   December31 2016 2015 2014 Income   available to common stockholders Net income $ 553 $ 525 $ 479 Less income   attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 2 2 Net income   available to common stockholders  basic and diluted $ 551 $ 523 $ 477 Average   common shares outstanding Weighted-average   shares  basic 277.9 275.6 270.6 Add dilutive   contingently convertible securities - - 3.1 Add dilutive   nonvested stock awards 1.0 0.9 0.9 Weighted-average   shares  diluted 278.9 276.5 274.6 Net   income per average common share available to common stockholders Basic $ 1.99 $ 1.90 $ 1.76 Diluted 1.98 1.89 1.74 Dividends   declared per common share $ 1.24 $ 1.16 $ 1.08 Contingently Convertible Securities In June2014, CMSEnergy redeemed its remaining contingently convertible securities. For the periods those securities were outstanding, they diluted EPS to the extent that the conversion value of the securities, which was based on the average market price of CMSEnergy common stock, exceeded their principal value.
Nonvested Stock Awards CMSEnergys nonvested stock awards are composed of participating and non-participating securities. The participating securities accrue cash dividends when common stockholders receive dividends. Since the recipient is not required to return the dividends to CMSEnergy if the recipient forfeits the award, the nonvested stock awards are considered participating securities. As such, the participating nonvested stock awards were included in the computation of basic EPS. The non-participating securities accrue stock dividends that vest concurrently with the stock award. If the recipient forfeits the award, the stock dividends accrued on the non-participating securities are also forfeited. Accordingly, the non-participating awards and stock dividends were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but not basic EPS.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents: Restricted cash and cash equivalents are held primarily for the repayment of securitization bonds. Cash and cash equivalents may also be restricted to pay other contractual obligations such as leasing of coal rail cars. These amounts are classified as current assets since they relate to payments that could or will occur within one year.
Other Non-Current Assets: The majority of cash equivalents classified as other non-current assets represent an investment in a money market fund held in the DBSERP rabbi trust. See Note6, Fair Value Measurements and Note12, Retirement Benefits for more information regarding the DBSERP.
149 Table of Contents 18: REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Reportable segments consist of business units defined by the products and services they offer. CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate the performance of each segment based on its contribution to net income available to CMSEnergys common stockholders.
Accounting policies for CMSEnergys and Consumers segments are as described in Note1, Significant Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the individual segments when appropriate. Accounts are allocated among the segments when common accounts are attributable to more than one segment. The allocations are based on certain measures of business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers, other operation and maintenance expense, construction expense, leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For example, customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.
Inter-segment sales and transfers are accounted for at current market prices and are eliminated in consolidated net income available to common stockholders by segment.

154 Table of Contents 20: VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CMSEnergy has variable interests in T.E.S.Filer City, Grayling, Genesee, and Craven. CMSEnergy is not the primary beneficiary of any of these partnerships because decision making is shared among unrelated parties, and no one party has the ability to direct activities, such as operations and maintenance, plant dispatch, and fuel strategy, that most significantly impact the entities economic performance. The partners must agree on all major decisions for each of the partnerships.
Presented in the following table is information about these partnerships: Name (Ownership   Interest) Nature of the Entity Financing of   Partnership T.E.S. Filer City (50%) Coal-fueled power   generator Line of credit secured   by T.E.S. Filer Citys coal inventory Grayling (50%) Wood waste-fueled power   generator Line of credit secured   by specific assets of Grayling. This line of credit expired in 2016.
Genesee (50%) Wood waste-fueled power   generator Sale of revenue bonds   that mature in 2021 and bear interest at fixed rates. The debt is   non-recourse to the partners and secured by a CMSEnergy guarantee   capped at $3million annually.
Craven (50%) Wood waste-fueled power   generator Line of credit secured   by Cravens property, plant, and equipment CMSEnergy has operating and management contracts with Grayling, Genesee, and Craven. Additionally, Consumers is the primary purchaser of power from T.E.S. Filer City, Grayling, and Genesee through long-term PPAs. Consumers also has reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee, which allow these facilities to be dispatched based on the market price of power compared with the cost of production of the plants. This results in fuel cost savings that each partnership shares with Consumers customers.
CMSEnergys investment in these partnerships is included in investments on its consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $62million as of December31,2016 and $61million as of December31,2015. The creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the general credit of CMSEnergy or Consumers, except through a guarantee provided by CMSEnergy of $3million annually. CMSEnergy has deferred collections on certain receivables owed by Genesee. CMSEnergys maximum exposure to loss from these receivables is $8million. Consumers has not provided any financial or other support during the periods presented that was not previously contractually required.

156 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CMSEnergy Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows, and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CMSEnergy Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31,2016 and December31,2015 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the threeyears in the period ended December31,2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item15(a)(2)present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
