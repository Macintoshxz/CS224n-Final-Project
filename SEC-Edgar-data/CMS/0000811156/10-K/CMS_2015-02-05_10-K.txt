12 Table of Contents PARTI ITEM1. BUSINESS GENERAL CMSE NERGY CMSEnergy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and biomass.
CMSEnergy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides, and operates principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers consolidated operations account for substantially all of CMSEnergys total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMSEnergys consolidated operating revenue was $7.2billion in 2014, $6.6billion in 2013, and $6.3billion in 2012.
For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to all of CMSEnergys business segments and operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMSEnergys Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
C ONSUMERS Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.6million of Michigans 10million residents. Consumers rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as described in CMSEnergy and Consumers Regulation in this Item1.
Consumers consolidated operating revenue was $6.8billion in 2014, $6.3billion in 2013, and $6.0billion in 2012. For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers electric and gas utility operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consumers Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond Indenture. For additional information on Consumers properties, see Consumers Electric Utility  Electric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility  Gas Utility Properties in the Business Segments section of this Item1.
13 Table of Contents In2014, Consumers served 1.8million electric customers and 1.7million gas customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map is Consumers service territory: 14 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENTS C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY Electric Utility Operations: Consumers electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $4.4billion in 2014, $4.2billion in 2013, and $4.0billion in 2012. Consumers electric utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2014 electric utility operating revenue of $4.4billion by customer class: Consumers electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
In 2014, Consumers electric deliveries were 38billionkWh, which included ROA deliveries of fourbillionkWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34billionkWh. In 2013, Consumers electric deliveries were 37billionkWh, which included ROA deliveries of fourbillionkWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 33billionkWh.
Consumers electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.
15 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2014 and 2013: Consumers 2014 summer peak demand was 7,498MW, which included ROA demand of 591MW. For the 2013-2014 winter period, Consumers peak demand was 5,960MW, which included ROA demand of 452MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term PPAs and short-term capacity purchases, capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2015.

Consumers generation capacity is a measure of the maximum electric output that Consumers has available to meet peak load requirements. As shown in the following illustration, Consumers 2014 generation capacity of 8,776MW, including purchased capacity of 2,863MW, relied on a variety of fuel sources: 18 Table of Contents Electric Utility Supply: Presented in the following table are the sources of Consumers electric supply over the last five years: GWh Years   Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Owned   generation Coal 15,684 15,951 14,027 15,468 17,879 Gas 2,012 1,415 3,003 1,912 1,043 Renewable   energy 748 704 433 425 365 Oil - 4 6 7 21 Net   pumped storage 1 (300 ) (371 ) (295 ) (365 ) (366 ) Total   owned generation 18,144 17,703 17,174 17,447 18,942 Purchased   and interchange power Purchased   renewable energy 2 2,366 2,250 1,435 1,587 1,582 Purchased   generation  other 2 10,073 10,871 13,104 11,087 10,421 Net   interchange power 3 4,793 3,656 4,151 6,825 6,045 Total   purchased and interchange power 17,232 16,777 18,690 19,499 18,048 Total   supply 35,376 34,480 35,864 36,946 36,990 1 Represents Consumers share of net pumped-storage generation. The pumped-storage facility consumes electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate electricity later during peak-demand hours.
2 Includes purchases from long-term PPAs.
3 Includes purchases from the MISO energy market and seasonal purchases.
During 2014, Consumers acquired 49percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers needs during peak demand periods.
At December31,2014, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which, in accordance with GAAP, liabilities have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants availability or deliverability. The payments for 2015 through 2036 are estimated to total $11.1billion and, for each of the next fiveyears, range from $1.0billion to $1.1billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A  Capital Resources and Liquidity and Note4, Contingencies and Commitments  Contractual Commitments.
During 2014, 44percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned ninemillion tons of coal and produced a combined total of 15,684GWh of electricity.
In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December31,2014, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2017; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $178million. Most of Consumers rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. Consumers vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation. At December31,2014, Consumers had 88percent of its 2015 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 36-day supply of coal on hand.
19 Table of Contents In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers generating facilities. Consumers coal transportation contracts expire through 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $430million at December 31, 2014.
During 2014, sixpercent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by natural gas-fueled generating units, which burned 15bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 2,012GWh of electricity.
In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For D.E.Karn, units 3 and 4, and the Zeeland plant, Consumers purchases gas from the market and transports the gas to the facilities on a firm basis. For its smaller combustion turbines, Consumers electric utility purchases and transports gas to its facilities as a bundled-rate tariff customer of either the gas utility or DTEGas.
Presented in the following table is the cost per million Btu of all fuels consumed, which fluctuates with the mix of fuel used.
Cost Per Million Btu Years Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Coal $ 2.72 $ 2.90 $ 2.98 $ 2.94 $ 2.51 Gas 7.19 4.68 3.16 4.95 5.57 Oil 20.16 19.47 19.08 18.55 10.98 Weighted-average   fuel cost $ 3.17 $ 3.07 $ 3.05 $ 3.18 $ 2.71 Electric Utility Competition: Consumers electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.
A Michigan statute enacted in 2000 allowed electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers. The 2008Energy Law revised the statute by limiting alternative electric supply to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December31,2014, Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 771MW of electric generation service to 308ROA customers.
In December2013, a bill was introduced to the Michigan House of Representatives that, if enacted, would have revised the 2008Energy Law by removing the ten-percent limit and allowing all of Consumers electric customers to take service from an alternative electric supplier. The bill also proposed to deregulate electric generation service in Michigan within twoyears. No action was taken prior to the end of the legislative session on this bill or on a similar bill introduced to the Michigan Senate. Consumers is unable to predict whether similar bills might be introduced during 2015.
In recent years, the Michigan legislature has conducted hearings on the subject of energy competition. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations.
Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:  industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers service territory for economic reasons;  municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and  customer self-generation.
20 Table of Contents Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas, by providing non-energy services and value to customers through Consumers rates and service, and by offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development.
C ONSUMERS G AS U TILITY Gas Utility Operations: Consumers gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.4billion in 2014, $2.1billion in 2013, and $2.0billion in 2012. Consumers gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2014 gas utility operating revenue of $2.4billion by customer class: Consumers gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
In 2014, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 373bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 65bcf. In 2013, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 352bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 63bcf. Consumers gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2014, 43percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.
21 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2014 and 2013: Gas Utility Properties: Consumers gas distribution and transmission system consists of:  27,169miles of distribution mains;  1,685miles of transmission lines;  sevencompressor stations with a total of 168,721installed and available horsepower; and  15gas storage fields with a total storage capacity of 309bcf and a working gas volume of 151bcf.
22 Table of Contents Gas Utility Supply: In 2014, Consumers purchased 68percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and sixpercent from Canadian producers. The remaining 26percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2014: Firm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR, Great Lakes Gas Transmission, Panhandle, and Trunkline. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2023 and provide for the delivery of 61percent of Consumers total gas supply requirements. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.
Gas Utility Competition: Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers gas utility business. Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.

25 Table of Contents For additional information, see Item1A. Risk Factors and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Air: Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $258million from 2015 through 2019 to comply with present and future federal and state environmental regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers estimate may increase if additional or more stringent laws or regulations are adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.
Solid Waste Disposal: Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Consumers solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigans solid waste rules. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems. All of Consumers ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. In December2014, the EPA issued new federal regulations for ash disposal areas. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with future regulations relating to ash disposal is $252million from 2015 through 2019, but this estimate could change significantly.
Water: Consumers uses substantial amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers facilities have discharge monitoring programs. Consumers expects the EPA to issue final federal regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2015. Consumers preliminary estimate of expenditures to comply with these expected regulations is $152million from 2015 through 2019.
In 2014, the EPA finalized its cooling water intake rule, which requires Consumers to evaluate the biological impact of its cooling water intake systems and ensure that it is using the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. Consumers preliminary estimate of expenditures to comply with these regulations is $100million from 2015 through 2019.

30 Table of Contents ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Actual results in future periods for CMSEnergy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections. CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMSEnergy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMSEnergy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMSEnergy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant.
CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.
Due to its holding company structure, CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMSEnergy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMSEnergy by its subsidiaries, CMSEnergy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity and financial condition.
CMSEnergy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.
The level of CMSEnergys present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others:  a significant portion of CMSEnergys cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes;  covenants contained in CMSEnergys existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business;  CMSEnergys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited;  CMSEnergy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged;  CMSEnergys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase; and  CMSEnergys future credit ratings could fluctuate.
CMSEnergys ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMSEnergy cannot make assurances that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMSEnergy were unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it could be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing.
31 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other contingent liabilities. Consumers capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it invests in the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, conversions and expansions, and other electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. Those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented.
CMSEnergy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if sufficient internal funds are not available from Consumers operations and, in the case of CMSEnergy, from dividends paid by Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments.
Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect CMSEnergys and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Consumers inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act, could adversely affect Consumers access to liquidity. Any liquidity disruption could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash. These measures could include deferring capital expenditures, changing CMSEnergys and Consumers commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.
CMSEnergy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial strategy. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/or common equity, commercial paper, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers may seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMSEnergys and Consumers securities in particular. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. If CMSEnergy or Consumers were unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or were unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, this could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Certain of CMSEnergys and Consumers securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could make its cost of borrowing higher, and could cause CMSEnergy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If it were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMSEnergy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMSEnergy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMSEnergys credit ratings. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.
32 Table of Contents There are risks associated with Consumers substantial capital investment program planned for the next fiveyears.
Consumers planned investments include the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:  effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers control;  effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects;  availability of qualified construction personnel;  changes in commodity and other prices;  governmental approvals and permitting;  operational performance;  changes in environmental, legislative and regulatory requirements; and  regulatory cost recovery.
It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Changes to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
The 2008Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are placing increasing competitive pressure on the cost of Consumers electric supply. Presently, Consumers electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers system is at the ten-percent limit and the proportion of Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 26percent. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers electric and gas rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Law to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, subject to certain limitations. If a final rate order from the MPSC provides for lower rates than Consumers self-implemented, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. Also, the MPSC may delay or deny implementation of a rate increase upon showing of good cause.
In addition, if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers plans for making significant capital investments. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of these investments. In addition, because certain costs are mandated by state requirements for cost recovery, such as resource additions to meet Michigans renewable resource standard, regulators could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other requested items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including an economic downturn in the state or diminishment of Consumers customer base. In addition to its 33 Table of Contents potential effects on Consumers investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility properties, regulatory assets, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired generating plants, costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy efficiency investments and state or federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Energy program costs, or expenditures subject to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non-paying customers, could prevent or curtail Consumers from self-implementing rate changes, could prevent or curtail the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism, or could require Consumers to refund previously self-implemented rates.
FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMSEnergy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates are also set by FERC. FERC orders related to transmission costs could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, investment plans, and results of operations.
Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. If it were determined that they failed to comply, CMSEnergy or Consumers could become subject to fines or penalties or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, and remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies, or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and their interpretations, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMSEnergys or Consumers operations could have a similar effect.
Utility regulation could be impacted by various matters, including electric industry restructuring, hydro relicensing, asset reclassification, gas pipeline capacity, new generation facilities or investments, environmental controls, climate change, air emissions, renewable energy, energy policy and ROA, regulation or deregulation, energy capacity standards or markets, reliability, and safety. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these matters on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Periodic reviews of the values of CMSEnergys and Consumers assets could result in impairment charges.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational characteristics of their assets, and other factors could result in recording impairment charges for their assets, which could have an 34 Table of Contents adverse effect on their equity and their access to additional financing. In addition, CMSEnergy and Consumers may be required to record impairment charges at the time they sell assets, depending on the sale prices they are able to secure and other factors.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations and expect that environmental laws and regulations will continue to become more stringent and require additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and CERCLA, will continue to have a material effect on CMSEnergy and Consumers.
In 2014, 96percent of the energy generated by Consumers came from fossil-fuel-fired power plants, with 85percent coming from coal-fueled power plants. CMSEnterprises also has interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. In June2014, the EPA published proposed rulespursuant to Section111(d)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rulesthe Clean Power Plan. The proposed ruleswould require a 30percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). Federal environmental laws and rulesand international accords and treaties could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in non-fossil-fuel-fired generating capacity, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases.
The following risks related to climate change and emissions could also have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations:  litigation originated by third parties against CMSEnergy, Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to CMSEnergys or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions;  impairment of CMSEnergys or Consumers reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation;and  extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assets.
Consumers plans to retire seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units by April2016 and three smaller natural gas-fueled electric generating units by June2015. Once the facilities and equipment on these sites are taken out of service, Consumers may encounter previously unknown environmental conditions that will need to be addressed in a timely fashion with state and federal environmental regulators.
Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMSEnergys and/or Consumers liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and CMSEnergy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.
For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item1. Business, CMSEnergy and Consumers Environmental Compliance and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A  Outlook, Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties.
35 Table of Contents CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.
A delay or failure by CMSEnergy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits, approvals under the MISO tariff, or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could:  prevent the construction of new facilities;  prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities;  prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities;  prevent the modification of existing facilities; or  result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.
Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to be able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.
In addition, CMSEnergy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection, treatment, and discharge of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. CMSEnergy has signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relating to Bay Harbor. If CMSEnergy were unable to meet its commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, CMSEnergy could incur additional material costs relating to its Bay Harbor remediation obligations.
Consumers also expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.
CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas,Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged false natural gas price reporting. Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMSEnergy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMSEnergy may be liable. It is possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
The agreements that CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:  retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions;  indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMSEnergy and Consumers make; and  make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions.
36 Table of Contents Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $142million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale and may proceed to formal arbitration. CMSEnergy is vigorously contesting the claim, and cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. It is possible that the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.
CMSEnergys and Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Accordingly, CMSEnergys and Consumers overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of significant, extreme weather events on Consumers system could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.
Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.
In the regular course of business, CMSEnergy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to laws and rulesissued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMSEnergys and Consumers information or control systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events could disrupt operations, subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems are vulnerable to being disabled, to failures, to cyber crime, and to unauthorized access. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMSEnergy and Consumers, has increased in 37 Table of Contents frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMSEnergy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber attack in the future. If technology systems were to fail or be breached, CMSEnergy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, or the inability of CMSEnergy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses have safety risks.
Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure, wind energy or solar equipment, energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMSEnergy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMSEnergy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMSEnergy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.
CMSEnergys and Consumers revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions, vandalism, and other catastrophic events.
The impact of natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber intrusions, pandemics, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMSEnergy and Consumers could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could result in severe damage to CMSEnergys and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate compliance policies, regulatory violations, or other events. This could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.
The markets for alternative energy and distributed generation could impact financial results.
Technology advances and government incentives and subsidies could reduce or shift the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, and could place additional system burdens on CMSEnergy and Consumers. It is also possible that electric customers could reduce their electric consumption significantly through demand-side energy conservation and energy efficiency programs. Changes in technology could also alter the channels 38 Table of Contents through which electric customers buy electricity. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.
Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMSEnergy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.
Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electricity, capacity, emission allowances, and RECs. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its plants consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets.
Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers might not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in laws that limit Consumers ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom they do business.
Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMSEnergy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMSEnergys and Consumers services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMSEnergy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers lenders, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMSEnergys banking subsidiary, EnerBank.
Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.
Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterpartys failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts 39 Table of Contents will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather.
If, for its electric generating capacity, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas or coal requirements under existing or future natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generating resources in the MISO energy market. If, for natural gas delivery to its customers, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC. These alternatives could increase Consumers working capital requirements and could decrease its revenues.
Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding.
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMSEnergys and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMSEnergy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMSEnergys and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.
Over 40percent of Consumers employees are represented by unions. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Additionally, while Consumers presently has good relationships with the unions representing its employees, Consumers cannot predict the impact of the expiration of union contracts in 2015.
Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations.
The workforce of CMSEnergy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMSEnergys and Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be affected negatively.
40 Table of Contents Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.
Unforeseen maintenance of Consumers power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, extreme weather, floods or other acts of God, equipment failure, operator error, or the need to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers costs of generation or be forced to retire a given unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Additionally, unplanned maintenance work could reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and could cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMSEnergy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Increases in local, state, or federal tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and could involve material costs or affect operations.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed into law. Congress detailed some significant changes, but the Dodd-Frank Act leaves many details to be determined by regulation and further study. Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are still being adopted by the appropriate agencies.
The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The statutory effective date of the Volcker Rulewas July2012, but it is subject to certain transition periods and exceptions for permitted activities. In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board issued final regulations clarifying that banks and other financial institutions had until 2015 to conform fully their activities and investments to the requirements. In December2014, the Federal Reserve Board issued an order extending to July2016 the date by which banking entities must comply with the Volcker Rules prohibition on owning interests in covered funds and further indicated its intention to grant another extension, in December2015, of the covered funds deadline to July2017. Under the statute, the activities of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they will be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMSEnergy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain ongoing compliance 41 Table of Contents requirements pursuant to the regulations. CMSEnergy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Ruleon CMSEnergys or EnerBanks operations or financial condition.
Furthermore, effective July2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMSEnergy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMSEnergy is contractually required (i)to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii)to provide EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeds them as of February2015.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMSEnergy, Consumers, and CMSERM qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities.
CMSEnergys and Consumers financial statements, including their reported earnings, could be significantly impacted by convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board is making broad changes to GAAP as part of an overall initiative to converge U.S. standards with International Financial Reporting Standards. These changes could have significant impacts on the financial statements of CMSEnergy and Consumers. Also, the SEC has been considering incorporating International Financial Reporting Standards into the financial reporting system for U.S. registrants. A transition to International Financial Reporting Standards could significantly impact CMSEnergys and Consumers financial results, since these standards differ from GAAP in many ways. One of the major differences is the lack of special accounting treatment for regulated activities under International Financial Reporting Standards, which could result in greater earnings volatility for CMSEnergy and Consumers.

49 Table of Contents CMS Energy Corporation Consumers Energy Company MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This MD&A is a combined report of CMSEnergy and Consumers.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW CMSEnergy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, owns and operates power generation facilities.
CMSEnergy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMSEnergy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility.
CMSEnergy and Consumers earn revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services; electric distribution and generation; gas transmission, storage, and distribution; and other energy-related services. Their businesses are affected primarily by:  regulation and regulatory matters;  economic conditions;  weather;  energy commodity prices;  interest rates; and  CMSEnergys and Consumers securities credit ratings.
CMSEnergys and Consumers business strategy emphasizes the key elements depicted below: 50 Table of Contents Accountability is part of CMSEnergys and Consumers corporate culture. CMSEnergy and Consumers are committed to making the right choices to serve their customers safely and affordably and to acting responsibly as corporate citizens. CMSEnergy and Consumers hold themselves accountable to the highest standards of safety, operational performance, and ethical behavior, and work diligently to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations that govern the electric and gas industry. Consumers 2014 accountability report, which is available to the public, provides an overview of Consumers efforts to continue meeting Michigans energy needs safely and efficiently, and highlights Consumers commitment to Michigan businesses, its corporate citizenship, and its role in reducing the states air emissions.
S AFE, E XCELLENT O PERATIONS The safety of employees, customers, and the general public remains a priority of CMSEnergy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMSEnergy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. From 2006 through 2014, Consumers achieved a 70percent reduction in the annual number of recordable safety incidents.
C USTOMER V ALUE Consumers is undertaking a number of initiatives that reflect its intensified customer focus. Consumers planned investments in reliability are aimed at improving safety, reducing customer outage frequency, reducing repetitive outages, and increasing customer satisfaction. Also, in order to minimize increases in customer base rates, Consumers has undertaken several additional initiatives to reduce costs through voluntary separation plans, accelerated pension funding, employee and retiree health care cost sharing, negotiated labor agreements, information and control system efficiencies, and productivity improvements. Consumers has also issued Securitization bonds and is accelerating the recognition of certain tax benefits, both of which will result in cost savings for customers. These initiatives allowed Consumers to avoid increasing electric and gas base rates in 2014.
51 Table of Contents U TILITY I NVESTMENT Consumers expects to make capital investments of about $15.5billion from 2015 through 2024. This amount includes $7.4billion through 2019, as presented in the following illustration: Consumers has limited its capital investment program to those investments it believes are needed to provide safe, reliable, and efficient service to its customers. Consumers capital investment program is expected to result in annual rate base growth of five to sevenpercent while allowing Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the rate of inflation.
Among the key components of Consumers investment program are projects that will enhance customer value. Consumers planned base capital investments of $4.1billion represent projects to maintain Consumers system and comprise $2.5billion at the electric utility to preserve reliability and capacity and $1.6billion at the gas utility to sustain deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity. An additional $1.5billion of planned reliability investments at Consumers are aimed at reducing outages and improving customer satisfaction; these investments comprise $0.8billion at the electric utility to strengthen circuits and substations, replace poles, and upgrade the Ludington pumped-storage plant and $0.7billion at the gas utility to replace mains and enhance transmission and storage systems. Consumers also expects to spend $0.9billion on environmental investments needed to comply with state and federal laws and regulations.
Consumers Smart Energy program, with an estimated total project capital cost of $0.8billion, also represents a major capital investment. The full-scale deployment of advanced metering infrastructure began in 2012 and is planned to continue through 2017. Consumers has spent $0.3billion through 2014 on its Smart Energy program, and expects to spend an additional $0.5billion, following a phased approach, from 2015 through 2017.
52 Table of Contents Consumers also expects to spend $0.3billion on new natural gas-fueled electric generation. The majority of this amount relates to an agreement that Consumers signed in 2013 to purchase a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant located in Jackson, Michigan for $155million. As provided for in the agreement, the purchase is subject to MPSC and other approvals. Consumers expects to close the purchase in early 2016.
R EGULATION Regulatory matters are a key aspect of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, particularly Consumers rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC. Important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.
Electric Rate Case: Consumers filed a general electric rate case with the MPSC in December2014, seeking an annual rate increase of $163million based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing also seeks approval of an investment recovery mechanism that would allow recovery of an additional $163million in total for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in 2016 and 2017 and $78million for incremental investments planned in 2018, subject to reconciliation.
Gas Rate Case: In July2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $88million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investments that will allow Consumers to improve system reliability, comply with regulations, and enhance technology.
In January2015, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing a $45million annual rate increase, based on a 10.3percent authorized return on equity. This was Consumers first gas base rate increase since 2012.
Securitization: In July2014, Consumers, through its subsidiary Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding, issued $378million of Securitization bonds to finance the recovery of the remaining book value of seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units that it plans to retire by April2016 and three smaller natural gas-fueled electric generating units that it plans to retire by June2015. The MPSC approved the issuance of these bonds in 2013 and authorized Consumers to collect from its retail electric customers, with some exceptions, Securitization charges to cover the principal and interest on the bonds as well as certain other qualified costs.
The 2008Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. At December31,2014, Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit. In recent years, bills have been introduced to the Michigan House of Representatives and the Michigan Senate to raise or remove the ROA limit; however, n o action was taken on these bills prior to the end of the legislative session.
Consumers is unable to predict whether similar bills might be introduced in 2015. In addition, the Michigan legislature has conducted hearings on the subject of energy competition. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations.
Environmental regulation is another area of importance for CMSEnergy and Consumers, and they are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including initiatives to regulate greenhouse gases, and related litigation. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that environmental laws and regulations related to their operations will continue to become more stringent and require them to make additional substantial capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean 53 Table of Contents Air Act, including the Clean Power Plan, as well as the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and CERCLA, will continue to have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergy and Consumers.
F INANCIAL P ERFORMANCE IN 2014 AND B EYOND In 2014, CMSEnergys net income available to common stockholders was $477million, and diluted EPS were $1.74. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $452million and diluted EPS of $1.66 in 2013. Among the factors contributing to CMSEnergys improved performance in 2014 were increased gas sales due to colder winter weather and the impacts of cost-reduction initiatives.
Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMSEnergys and Consumers performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.
Michigan is placed in the first quartile of states based on its strong economic growth since 2010. Consumers expects that the continued rise in industrial production will drive its electric deliveries to increase annually by about 0.5percent on average through 2019. Excluding the impacts of energy efficiency programs, Consumers expects its electric deliveries to increase by about 1.5percent annually through 2019. Consumers is projecting that its gas deliveries will remain stable through 2019. This outlook reflects growth in gas demand offset by energy efficiency and conservation.
As Consumers seeks to continue to receive fair and timely regulatory treatment, delivering customer value will remain a key strategic priority. In order to minimize increases in customer base rates, Consumers has set goals to achieve further annual productivity improvements. Additionally, Consumers will strive to give priority to capital investments that increase customer value or lower costs.
Consumers expects to continue to have sufficient borrowing capacity to fund its investment-based growth plans. CMSEnergy also expects its sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its cash requirements. To identify potential implications for CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses and future financial needs, the companies will continue to monitor developments in the financial and credit markets, as well as government policy responses to those developments.

Electric deliveries and rate increases: For 2014, electric delivery revenues increased $36million compared with 2013. This change reflected a $33million benefit from a May2013 rate increase that 56 Table of Contents Consumers self-implemented in March2013, $14million from a low-income assistance surcharge, and a $16million increase in other revenues related to the renewable energy program. These increases were offset partially by a $27million reduction due primarily to a decrease in sales to Consumers higher-margin customers. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.6billionkWh in 2014 and 36.9billionkWh in 2013.
For 2013, electric delivery revenues increased $95million compared with 2012. This increase reflected a $64million benefit from a May2013 rate increase that Consumers self-implemented in March2013, and the absence, in 2013, of a $59million charge to write off Consumers electric decoupling regulatory asset in 2012. These increases were offset partially by a $24million reduction in revenues resulting from lower sales in the high-margin summer months due to milder weather in 2013 and a $4million decrease in other revenue. Deliveries to end-use customers were 36.9billionkWh in 2013 and 38.1billionkWh in 2012.
Other income, net of expenses: For 2014, other income, net of expenses, decreased $16million compared with 2013. This decrease was due primarily to increased charitable contributions and political contributions to oppose certain Michigan legislative proposals related to ROA.
For 2013, other income, net of expenses, increased $15million compared with 2012. This increase was due primarily to the absence, in 2013, of contributions related to a 2012 Michigan ballot proposal.
Maintenance and other operating expenses: For 2014, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $24million compared with 2013. This decrease was due to a $46million reduction in postretirement benefit costs and a $32million reduction in service restoration costs due primarily to severe storms that occurred in Novemberand December2013. These decreases were offset largely by $14million of increased expenses related to a low-income assistance program, $14million of increased expenses associated with information technology projects, and $26million of higher forestry and other operating and maintenance expenses.
For 2013, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $24million compared with 2012. This change reflected a $51million increase in service restoration costs, less $16million of insurance proceeds, associated with severe storms that occurred in Novemberand December2013. Additionally, expenses were higher due to the absence, in 2013, of a $14million recovery associated with Consumers cancelled coal-fueled plant, and a $12million benefit related to Consumers settlement with the DOE. These increases were offset partially by an $18million reduction in OPEB cost resulting from OPEB Plan changes adopted in July2013, a $5million reduction in OPEB cost due to favorable OPEB Plan performance, and a $14million decrease in other distribution operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization: For 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $38million compared with 2013, due primarily to increased plant in service in 2014 and higher amortization of securitized assets.
For 2013, depreciation and amortization expense increased $25million compared with 2012. This increase was due primarily to increased plant in service and an increase in depreciation rates authorized in a June2012 rate order, offset partially by lower amortization expense on certain regulatory assets.
General Taxes : For 2014, general taxes increased $10million compared with 2013, and for 2013, general taxes increased $5million compared with 2012, due primarily to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.
Income taxes: For 2014, income taxes decreased $30million compared with 2013. This change was due primarily to the accelerated flow-through of income tax benefits under an MPSC accounting order that Consumers implemented in January2014.
57 Table of Contents For 2013, income taxes increased $16million compared with 2012, primarily reflecting higher electric utility earnings offset partially by the absence, in 2013, of non-deductible contributions related to a 2012 Michigan ballot proposal.

Gas deliveries and rate increases: For 2014, gas delivery revenues increased $28million compared with 2013. This change reflected $32million of higher sales, due primarily to colder winter weather in 2014 and a $3million increase in other revenue, offset partially by a $7million decrease associated with the energy efficiency program. Deliveries to end-use customers were 331bcf in 2014 and 307bcf in 2013.
For 2013, gas delivery revenues increased $89million compared with 2012. This increase reflected an $82million benefit from higher customer deliveries, due primarily to colder winter weather in 2013, offset partially by the impact on 2012 revenues of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism. Additionally, revenue increased $7million due to a June2012 rate increase that Consumers self-implemented in March2012. Deliveries to end-use customers were 307bcf in 2013 and 259bcf in 2012.
Other income, net of expenses: For 2014, other income, net of expenses, decreased $4million compared with 2013, due primarily to increased charitable contributions.
Maintenance and other operating expenses: For 2014, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $5million compared with 2013. This decrease was due to a $27million reduction in postretirement benefit costs and a $7million decrease in expenses related to the energy efficiency program. These decreases were offset largely by a $5million increase in expenses associated with information technology projects, a $9million increase in uncollectible accounts expense, and a $15million increase related to pipeline integrity and other gas operating and maintenance expenses.
For 2013, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $11million compared with 2012. This decrease was due to a $10million reduction in OPEB cost resulting from OPEB Plan changes adopted in July2013, and a $5million reduction in OPEB cost due to favorable OPEB Plan performance. These decreases were offset partially by a $4million increase in other operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization: For 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $18million compared with 2013, and for 2013, depreciation and amortization expense increased $4million compared with 2012. Both increases were due to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service.
58 Table of Contents General Taxes : For2014, general taxes increased $6million compared with 2013, due to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.
Income taxes: For 2014, income taxes decreased $9million compared with 2013. This change was due primarily to the accelerated flow-through of income tax benefits under an MPSC accounting order that Consumers implemented in January2014.
For 2013, income taxes increased $34million compared with 2012, due primarily to higher gas utility earnings.

The $3million decrease was due primarily to a $9million after-tax increase in the environmental remediation liability associated with Bay Harbor, offset partially by the absence in 2014 of $4million in additional tax expense related to OPEB Plan changes adopted in July2013 and $2million in lower after-tax administrative and maintenance expenses.
For 2013, net income of the enterprises segment decreased $14million compared with 2012. This decrease was attributable to the absence, in 2013, of $6million of tax benefits in 2012 due primarily to law changes related to Medicare PartD, $4million of additional tax expense in 2013 due to OPEB Plan changes adopted in July2013, and $4million in higher after-tax expenses due primarily to the absence in 2013 of a 2012 insurance settlement.

For 2014, net cash provided by operating activities at CMSEnergy increased $26million compared with 2013, and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers decreased $13million compared with 2013. At CMS Energy and Consumers, increases in net cash provided by operating activities were due primarily to lower postretirement benefits contributions and higher cash collections of accounts receivable from customers, offset partially by an increase in GCR underrecoveries, higher gas volumes purchased due to lower initial gas inventory levels, and the absence, in 2014, of the receipt of a $69million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park . At Consumers, these increases were also offset by higher income tax payments to CMSEnergy.
60 Table of Contents For 2013, net cash provided by operating activities at CMSEnergy increased $180million compared with 2012, and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers decreased $2million compared with 2012. At CMS Energy and Consumers, increases in net cash provided by operating activities were due primarily to higher net income, net of non-cash transactions, the receipt of a $69million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park, and a reduction in working capital due to higher usage of gas and other fuel from inventory and the collection of PSCR underrecoveries. These increases were offset partially by higher pension contributions in 2013, a refund to customers of $23million related to the DOE settlement, and a $24million premium paid for the early retirement of debt in 2013. At Consumers, these increases were also offset by higher income tax payments to CMSEnergy.

At CMS Energy and Consumers, the changes were due primarily to an increase in net debt issuances, offset partially by higher repayments under Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program. At Consumers, the change was also due to increased stockholder contributions by CMSEnergy, offset partially by increases in Consumers dividend payments to CMSEnergy.
For 2013, net cash provided by financing activities at CMSEnergy increased $149million compared with 2012, and net cash provided by financing activities at Consumers increased by $203million compared with 2012. At CMS Energy and Consumers, the changes were due primarily to an increase in net debt issuances, offset partially by an increase in dividends on common stock and a decrease in proceeds from Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program.
62 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY CMSEnergy uses dividends from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non-utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMSEnergys subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMSEnergy depends upon each subsidiarys revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its debt covenants and articles of incorporation, and potentially by FERC requirements and provisions under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act. For additional details on Consumers dividend restrictions, see Note5, Financings and Capitalization  Dividend Restrictions. For the year ended December31,2014, Consumers paid $457million in dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy.
In April2013, CMSEnergy entered into a continuous equity offering program permitting it to sell, from time to time through at the market offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $50million. In March2014, CMSEnergy issued common stock under this program and received net proceeds of $30million.
Consumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from CMSEnergy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, contribute to its employee benefit plans, and fund its other obligations. As a result of accelerated pension funding in recent years and several initiatives to reduce costs, Consumers anticipates continued strong cash flows from operating activities in 2015.
Access to the financial and capital markets depends on CMSEnergys and Consumers credit ratings and on market conditions. As evidenced by past financing transactions, CMSEnergy and Consumers have had ready access to these markets. Barring major market dislocations or disruptions, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets. If access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, CMSEnergy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending. Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers secured revolving credit facilities available at December31,2014: InMillions Amountof Amount LettersofCredit Amount Facility Borrowed Outstanding Available ExpirationDate CMSEnergy parent Revolving credit facility 1 $550 $- $3 $547 December2018 Consumers Revolving credit facility 2 $650 $- $35 $615 December2018 Revolving credit facility 2 30 - 30 - May2018 1 Obligations under this facility are secured by Consumers common stock.
2 Obligations under this facility are secured by FMBs of Consumers.
63 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. Additional sources of liquidity are Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program and its commercial paper program. Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program allows it to transfer up to $250million of eligible accounts receivable as a secured borrowing. At December31,2014, no accounts receivable had been transferred and $250million were eligible under this program. Consumers entered into its commercial paper program in September2014. Under the program, Consumers may issue, in one or more placements, commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days and that bear interest at fixed or floating rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers $650million revolving credit facility and may have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of up to $500million. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the revolvers available capacity, Consumers would not issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available revolver capacity. At December31,2014, $60million of commercial paper notes were outstanding under this program.
Certain of CMSEnergys and Consumers credit agreements, debt indentures, and other facilities contain covenants that require CMSEnergy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. At December31,2014, no events of default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in CMSEnergys and Consumers credit agreements, debt indentures, or other facilities. CMSEnergy and Consumers were each in compliance with these covenants as of December31,2014, as presented in the following table: December31,2014 CreditAgreement,Indenture,orFacility Description Limit Actual CMSEnergy parent $550million revolving credit agreement and $180million term loan credit agreement Debt to EBITDA < 6.0 to 1.0 4.7 to 1.0 $180million term loan credit agreement Interest Coverage > 2.0 to 1.0 4.5 to 1.0 Consumers $650million and $30million revolving   credit agreements, $35million and $68million   reimbursement agreements, and $250million revolving accounts receivable   sales agreement Debt to Capital < 0.65 to 1.0 0.48 to 1.0 Components of CMSEnergys and Consumers cash management plan include controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for financing and refinancing opportunities. CMSEnergys and Consumers present level of cash and expected cash flows from operating activities, together with access to sources of liquidity, are anticipated to be sufficient to fund the companies contractual obligations for 2015 and beyond.

CMSEnergy and Consumers also have recognized non-current liabilities for which the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. These items, which are excluded from the table above, include regulatory liabilities, deferred income taxes, workers compensation liabilities, accrued liabilities under 65 Table of Contents renewable energy programs, and other liabilities. Retirement benefits are also excluded from the table above. For details related to benefit payments, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements: CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries also enter into various arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities are usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum payment that could be required under a number of these indemnity obligations is not estimable; the maximum obligation under indemnities for which such amounts were estimable was $150million at December31,2014. While CMSEnergy and Consumers believe it is unlikely that they will incur any material losses related to indemnities they have not recorded as liabilities, they cannot predict the impact of these contingent obligations on their liquidity and financial condition. For additional details on these and other guarantee arrangements, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments  Guarantees.
Capital Expenditures: Over the next fiveyears, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to make substantial capital investments. CMSEnergy and Consumers may revise their forecasts of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2015 through 2019: InMillion s 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total CMSEnergy, including   Consumers Consumers $ 1,600 $ 1,600 $ 1,400 $ 1,400 $ 1,400 $ 7,400 Enterprises 14 14 13 72 72 185 Total CMSEnergy $ 1,614 $ 1,614 $ 1,413 $ 1,472 $ 1,472 $ 7,585 Consumers Electric utility operations $ 1,100 $ 1,100 $ 900 $ 900 $ 1,000 $ 5,000 Gas utility operations 500 500 500 500 400 2,400 Total Consumers $ 1,600 $ 1,600 $ 1,400 $ 1,400 $ 1,400 $ 7,400 OUTLOOK Several business trends and uncertainties may affect CMSEnergys and Consumers financial condition and results of operations.

C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY AND G AS U TILITY B USINESS O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES Energy Optimization Plan: The 2008Energy Law requires Consumers to achieve energy savings equivalent to annual usage reduction targets through at least 2015. The targets increase annually, with the goal of achieving cumulative reductions of 5.6percent in customers electricity use and 3.9percent in customers natural gas use by December31,2015. Under its energy optimization plan, Consumers provides its customers with incentives to reduce usage by offering energy audits, rebates and discounts on purchases of highly efficient appliances, and other incentives and programs.
At December31,2014, Consumers had achieved cumulative reductions of 6.0percent in customers electricity use and 4.0percent in customers natural gas use; the savings results will be certified by a third party. Consumers estimates that, through its gas and electric energy optimization programs, its customers realized $280million in energy savings during 2014.
66 Table of Contents Smart Energy: Consumers grid modernization effort continues. In2012, Consumers began installing smart meters for electric residential and small business customers in western Michigan. One of the functions of smart meters is to allow customers to monitor and manage their energy usage, which Consumers expects will help reduce demand during critical peak times, resulting in lower peak electric capacity requirements. The installation of smart meters should also provide for both operational and customer benefits. As of December31,2014, Consumers had upgraded 389,000 electric customers in western Michigan to smart meters. Of the customers scheduled for the upgrade, 0.5percent have chosen not to participate in the smart meter program.
Consumers is able to disconnect and reconnect service, read, and bill from smart meters remotely; further functionality will continue to be added through 2015. Consumers expects that it will have installed a total of 1.8million smart meters throughout its service territory by the end of 2017. Consumers also plans to install 600,000 communication modules on gas meters in areas where Consumers provides both electricity and natural gas to customers.
C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY B USINESS O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES Clean Energy Plan: Consumers continues to experience increasing demand for electricity due to Michigans recovering economy and increased use of air conditioning, consumer electronics, and other electric devices, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. In order to address future capacity requirements and growing electric demand in Michigan, Consumers has a comprehensive clean energy plan designed to meet the short-term and long-term electricity needs of its customers through:  energy efficiency;  demand management;  expanded use of renewable energy;  construction or purchase of electric generating units;  continued operation or upgrade of existing units; and  short-term market capacity purchases.
In December2013, Consumers signed an agreement to purchase a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant located in Jackson, Michigan for $155million from AlphaGen PowerLLC and DPCJuniper,LLC, affiliates of JPMorgan Chase& Co. As provided for in the agreement, the purchase is subject to FERC, MPSC, and other approvals. Consumers received approval from FERC for the purchase in September2014. Consumers expects to close the purchase in early 2016.
In January2014, as a result of this planned purchase, Consumers announced plans to defer the development of its proposed 700-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant at its Thetford complex in Genesee County, Michigan, which Consumers estimated would have cost $700million. The MDEQ granted an extension of the projects air permit in January2015. The permit will be void if Consumers does not start construction or obtain an additional extension before July2016.
In September2014, Consumers completed a reverse auction to purchase generation capacity for 2015 through 2020. Under the contracts entered into as a result of the reverse auction, which were approved by the MPSC in January2015, Consumers has purchased 350MW of capacity for 2015, which represents fourpercent of Consumers capacity requirements for 2015. These contracts, combined with other sources, are expected to cover all of Consumers remaining capacity shortfall for 2015.
With the planned retirement of seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units in 2016, the purchase of the new natural gas-fueled electric generating plant, upgrades at Ludington, energy efficiency programs, and demand management programs, Consumers existing resources cover 98percent of its capacity requirements for 2016 through 2020. Consumers plans to take additional actions to cover the remaining 67 Table of Contents capacity requirements, including participation in the annual MISO planning resource auction, as demand forecasts become more certain.
Renewable Energy Plan: Consumers renewable energy plan details how Consumers expects to meet REC and capacity standards prescribed by the 2008Energy Law. This law requires Consumers to use RECs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource, to achieve certain renewable energy targets. The targets increase annually, with a goal of using RECs in an amount equal to at least tenpercent of Consumers electric sales volume (estimated to be 3.3million RECs annually) in 2015 and each year thereafter. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers expects to meet its renewable energy requirement each year with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years.
The 2008Energy Law also requires Consumers to obtain 500MW of new capacity from renewable energy resources by the end of 2015, either through generation resources owned by Consumers or through agreements to purchase capacity from other parties. With the completion of the Cross Winds  Energy Park in December2014, Consumers met its renewable capacity requirement one year earlier than required. Consumers has contracted for the purchase of 298MW of nameplate capacity from renewable energy suppliers and owns 212MW of nameplate capacity at its Lake Winds  and Cross Winds  Energy Parks.
Cross Winds  Energy Park will qualify for certain federal production tax credits that should reduce significantly the cost of complying with the renewable requirements of the 2008Energy Law. Consumers expects to receive $100million to $120million of federal production tax credits, which will be realized over the first ten years of the wind projects operation. These cost savings will be passed on to customers.
Electric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers electric customer deliveries are largely dependent on Michigans economy. Consumers expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to increase in 2015 by 1.0percent compared with 2014.
Over the next fiveyears, Consumers expects average electric delivery growth of about 0.5percent annually. This increase reflects growth in electric demand, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency programs and appliance efficiency standards. Actual delivery levels will depend on:  energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency programs;  fluctuations in weather; and  Michigan economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, and housing activity.
Electric ROA: The 2008Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. At December31,2014, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 771MW of generation service to ROA customers. Of Consumers 1.8million electric customers, 308customers, or 0.02percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program.
In December2013, a bill was introduced to the Michigan House of Representatives that, if enacted, would have revised the 2008Energy Law by removing the ten-percent limit and allowing all of Consumers electric customers to take service from an alternative electric supplier. The bill also proposed to deregulate electric generation service in Michigan within twoyears. No action was taken prior to the end of the legislative session on this bill or on a similar bill introduced to the Michigan Senate. Consumers is unable to predict whether similar bills might be introduced during 2015.
68 Table of Contents In recent years, the Michigan legislature has conducted hearings on the subject of energy competition. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, Consumers financial results and operations could be materially adversely affected.
Electric Transmission: In 2012, ReliabilityFirst Corporation informed Consumers that Consumers may not be properly registered to meet certain NERC electric reliability standards. Consumers assessed its registration status, taking into consideration FERCs December2012 order on the definition of a bulk electric system, and in2013 notified ReliabilityFirst Corporation that it was preparing to register as a transmission owner, transmission planner, and transmission operator. In light of this order, Consumers reviewed the classification of certain electric distribution assets and, in April2014, filed an application for reclassification with the MPSC. In October2014, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement that will allow Consumers to reclassify $34million of net plant assets from distribution to transmission, subject to FERC approval. In January2015, Consumers filed an application for reclassification with FERC.
Electric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers electric utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters.
Electric Rate Design: In June2014, Michigans governor signed legislation requiring the MPSC to explore alternative cost allocation and rate design methods that would promote affordable and competitive rates for all electric customers. In conjunction with this legislation, Consumers submitted to the MPSC a proposal for a new electric rate design in October2014. This proposed new design will better ensure that rates are equal to the cost of service and will have the effect of making rates for energy-intensive industrial customers more competitive, while keeping residential bills affordable. Consumers incorporated its proposed new rate design into the rate case it filed in December2014.
Electric Rate Case: In December2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $163million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and technology enhancements. Presented in the following table are the components of the requested increase in revenue: InMillions Components   of the rate increase Investment   in rate base $185 Addition   of new gas plant 35 Operating   and maintenance costs 26 Cost   of capital 21 Working   capital 6 Cost-reduction   initiatives (80 ) Gross   margin (30 ) Total $163 The filing also seeks approval of an investment recovery mechanism that would allow recovery of an additional $163million in total for incremental investments that Consumers plans to make in 2016 and 2017 and $78million for incremental investments planned in 2018, subject to reconciliation.
Depreciation Rate Case: In June2014, Consumers filed a depreciation case related to its electric and common utility property. In this case, Consumers requested an increase in depreciation expense, and its recovery of that expense, of $28million annually.
PSCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2015 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2014 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2015 PSCR charge beginning in January2015.
69 Table of Contents Electric Environmental Outlook: Consumers operations are subject to various state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $0.9billion from 2015 through 2019 to continue to comply with the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and numerous state and federal environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters: Air Quality: In 2011, the EPA released CSAPR, a final replacement rulefor CAIR, which requires Michigan and 27 other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA computer models, contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other downwind states. In 2012, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit voided CSAPR and held that CAIR would remain in place until the EPA promulgated a new rule. This matter was appealed to the U.S.Supreme Court, which upheld and remanded the decision back to the D.C.Circuit for additional action in April2014. The D.C.Circuit has reinstated CSAPR, effective January2015. Several states and industry groups continue to challenge CSAPR in the D.C.Circuit. Consumers emissions are projected to be within the CSAPR allowance allocations.
In 2012, the EPA published emission standards for electric generating units, based on Section112 of the Clean Air Act, calling the final ruleMATS. Under MATS, all of Consumers existing coal-fueled electric generating units are required to add additional controls for hazardous air pollutants. Compliance is required by April2015, unless an extension is granted by the MDEQ. Consumers has received a one-year extension for ten of its coal-fueled units. Consumers expects to meet the extended deadline for the three units it intends to continue operating. Consumers plans to retire the remaining seven units by the extended deadline. Consumers also received a six-month extension for its two other coal-fueled units to accommodate new monitoring requirements. Consumers expects to install and operate the necessary pollution control equipment at those units by the original compliance date of April2015. MATS is presently being litigated and the U.S.Supreme Court has agreed to hear the appeal in early 2015.
In November2014, the EPA proposed a new ruleto lower the NAAQS for ozone. The EPA is under a court-ordered deadline to finalize the revised ozone NAAQS by October2015. The new ozone NAAQS are expected to make it more difficult to construct or modify power plants.
Presently, Consumers strategy to comply with air quality regulations, including CAIR, CSAPR, NAAQS, and MATS, involves the installation of emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate these rulesin conjunction with other EPA rulemakings, litigation, and congressional action. This evaluation could result in:  changes in environmental compliance costs related to Consumers coal-fueled power plants;  a change in the fuel mix at coal-fueled and oil-fueled power plants;  changes in how certain plants are used; and  the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of Consumers generating units.
The MDEQ renewed and issued the Renewable Operating Permit for the B.C.Cobb plant in August2011 and for the J.H.Campbell plant in July2013 after an extensive review and a public comment period. The Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed separate petitions with the EPA to object to the MDEQs issuance of the state Renewable Operating Permits for both of these facilities, alleging that the facilities are not in compliance with certain provisions of the Clean Air Act, including NSR and TitleV. Consumers has responded to these allegations. The EPA could either deny the petition outright or grant the petition and remand the matter to the MDEQ for further action. The Sierra Club or the Natural Resources Defense Council could also file suit in federal district court seeking EPA action on the petition. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of these actions.
70 Table of Contents Greenhouse Gases: There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, and national levels that involve the regulation of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives and to follow litigation involving greenhouse gases. Consumers believes Congress may eventually pass greenhouse gas legislation, but is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.
In January2014, the EPA published proposed rulespursuant to Section111(b)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new electric generating units. New coal-fueled units would not be able to meet this limit without installing carbon dioxide control equipment using such methods as carbon capture and sequestration. The proposed rulesfor new sources are expected to be finalized in 2015.
In June2014, the EPA published proposed rulespursuant to Section111(d)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rulesthe Clean Power Plan. The proposed ruleswould require a 30percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). Each state would have a tailored target based on its circumstances, and Consumers expects that Michigan would be required to achieve a 31percent reduction from 2012 levels, but there is significant uncertainty regarding the final targets. The rulesfor existing sources are expected to be finalized in 2015. Subsequent state implementation plans are due in 2016, but extensions are available. In addition, the Clean Power Plan is presently being litigated in the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit.
Consumers believes that its clean energy plan, its present carbon reduction target, and its emphasis on supply diversity will position it favorably to deal with the impact of carbon regulation, but cannot predict the final outcome of either of these EPA proposals or of Michigans implementation plan. Consumers will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding greenhouse gas emissions standards that may affect electric generating units.
Litigation, as well as federal laws, EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if enacted or ratified, could require Consumers to replace equipment, install additional emission control equipment, purchase emission allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.
CCRs: In December2014, the EPA issued a final ruleregulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The final rulewill adopt non-hazardous waste standards for CCRs. The rulewill add new requirements for groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust, and public disclosure of information. The rulewill also require closure of non-compliant surface impoundments and landfills within approximately three years, with limited potential for extensions. The ruleis expected to be published in early 2015. Consumers expects that planned capital expenditures will likely be accelerated to meet the compliance deadline, but is still evaluating the impacts of this rule.
Water: The EPAs ruleto regulate existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems under Section316(b)of the Clean Water Act became effective in October2014. The ruleis aimed at reducing alleged harmful impacts on fish and shellfish. Consumers does not expect any changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the final rule. Consumers also expects the EPA to issue final effluent limitation guidelines in 2015 that may require physical and/or chemical treatment of wastewater discharges from electric generating plants. Consumers will evaluate these rulesand their potential impacts on Consumers electric generating plants once they are final.
71 Table of Contents Many of Consumers facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are valid for fiveyears and vital to the facilities operations. Failure of the MDEQ to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility.
PCBs: In 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, indicating that it is considering a variety of regulatory actions with respect to PCBs. One approach would aim to phase out equipment containing PCBs by 2025. Another approach would eliminate an exemption for small equipment containing PCBs. To comply with any such regulatory actions, Consumers could incur substantial costs associated with existing electrical equipment potentially containing PCBs. A proposed ruleis expected in 2015.
Other electric environmental matters could have a major impact on Consumers outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments  Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies, Electric Environmental Matters.
C ONSUMERS G AS U TILITY B USINESS O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES Gas Deliveries: Consumers expects weather-adjusted gas deliveries in 2015 and over the next fiveyears to remain stable relative to 2014. This outlook reflects modest growth in gas demand offset by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary from this expectation due to:  fluctuations in weather;  use by power producers;  availability and development of renewable energy sources;  changes in gas prices;  Michigan economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity;  the price of competing energy sources or fuels; and  energy efficiency and conservation impacts.
Gas Rate Case: In July2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $88million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investments that will allow Consumers to improve system reliability, comply with regulations, and enhance technology.
In January2015, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing a $45million annual rate increase, based on a 10.3percent authorized return on equity. This was Consumers first gas base rate increase since 2012.
GCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2015-2016 GCR plan to the MPSC in December2014 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, expects to self-implement the 2015-2016 GCR charge beginning in April2015.
For additional details on rate matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters.
Gas Environmental Estimates: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23former MGP sites. For additional details, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments  Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies, Gas Environmental Matters.
72 Table of Contents E NTERPRISES O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES The primary focus with respect to CMSEnergys non-utility businesses is to optimize cash flow and maximize the value of their assets.
Trends, uncertainties, and other matters that could have a material impact on CMSEnergys consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include:  indemnity and environmental remediation obligations at Bay Harbor;  obligations related to a tax claim from the government of Equatorial Guinea;  the outcome of certain legal proceedings;  impacts of declines in electricity prices on the profitability of the enterprises segments generating units;  representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMSEnergy or its subsidiaries in connection with previous sales of assets;  changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings;  changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation; and  economic conditions in Michigan, including population trends and housing activity.
For additional details regarding the enterprises segments uncertainties, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
O THER O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES EnerBank: EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank represented threepercent of CMSEnergys net assets at December31,2014, and fourpercent of CMSEnergys net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December31,2014. The carrying value of EnerBanks loan portfolio was $938million at December31,2014. Its loan portfolio was funded primarily by deposit liabilities of $884million. The twelve-month rolling average default rate on loans held by EnerBank has remained stable at 0.6percent at December31,2014. CMSEnergy is required both by law and by contract to provide financial support, including infusing additional capital, to ensure that EnerBank satisfies mandated capital requirements and has sufficient liquidity to operate. With its self-funding plan, EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeded them as of December31,2014.
Litigation: CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters and Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and related information are important to an understanding of CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Note1, Significant Accounting Policies.
U SE OF E STIMATES AND A SSUMPTIONS In the preparation of CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMSEnergy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and 73 Table of Contents derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, and contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts: CMSEnergy and Consumers make ongoing estimates related to the collectibility of their accounts receivable and establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses, managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. Actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from those estimated by CMSEnergy and Consumers.
Asset Retirement Obligations: CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives if there is a legal obligation to remove them. CMSEnergy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove some of their assets at the end of their useful lives. CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected present-value technique that reflects assumptions about costs, inflation, and profit margin that third parties would require to assume the obligation. CMSEnergys ARO liabilities are primarily at Consumers. As a regulated entity, Consumers defers the effects of any changes in assumptions on the fair values of its ARO liabilities, adjusting the associated regulatory assets or liabilities rather than recognizing such effects in earnings. For additional details, see Note11, Asset Retirement Obligations.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMSEnergy and Consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMSEnergy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. For additional details, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Fair Value Measurements: CMSEnergy and Consumers have assets and liabilities that are accounted for or disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require significant judgment. For a detailed discussion of the valuation techniques and inputs used to calculate fair value measurements, see Note6, Fair Value Measurements. Details about the fair value measurements for the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan assets are included in Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Income Taxes: The amount of income taxes paid by CMSEnergy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMSEnergys judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMSEnergy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMSEnergys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time. For additional details, see Note14,Income Taxes.
74 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMSEnergy and Consumers assess the recoverability of their long-lived assets and equity method investments by performing impairment tests if certain triggering events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary. CMSEnergy and Consumers base their evaluations of impairment on such indicators as:  the nature of the assets;  projected future economic benefits;  regulatory and political environments;  historical and future cash flow and profitability measurements; and  other external market conditions and factors.
The estimates CMSEnergy and Consumers use may change over time, which could have a material impact on their consolidated financial statements.
Unbilled Revenues: Consumers customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as accounts receivable on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated balance sheets, were $459million at December31,2014 and $434million at December31,2013.
A CCOUNTING FOR THE E FFECTS OF I NDUSTRY R EGULATION Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators decisions on its financial statements.
Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings.
Alternative-Revenue Program: In 2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC. Consumers recognized revenue under this program of $17million in 2014, $22million in 2013, and $13million in 2012.
Revenue Subject to Refund: Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing; however, the rates that Consumers self-implements may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, it records a provision for revenue subject to refund. A final rate order could differ materially from Consumers estimates underlying its self-implemented rates, giving rise to accounting adjustments. Under accounting rulesfor prior period adjustments, CMSEnergy and Consumers may need to record such differences, if they are specifically identifiable to prior interim periods, as revisions to those periods. At December31,2014 and 2013, Consumers had no regulatory liability recorded related to self-implemented rates.
F INANCIAL AND D ERIVATIVE I NSTRUMENTS AND M ARKET R ISK I NFORMATION Financial Instruments: Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these securities are reported, net of tax, in equity 75 Table of Contents as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract.
The criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting or for an exception from derivative accounting are complex and often require significant judgment in application. Changes in business strategies or market conditions, as well as a requirement to apply different interpretations of the derivative accounting literature, could result in significant changes in accounting for a single contract or groups of contracts, which could have a material impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers financial statements. For additional details on CMSEnergys and Consumers derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Note6, Fair Value Measurements.
Market Risk Information: CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and investment security prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to mitigate exposure to these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into these contracts using established policies and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of certain officers and a risk committee consisting of those and other officers and business managers.
The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial instruments, assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of tenpercent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were to exceed tenpercent.
Interest-Rate Risk : CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate financing instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital.
Presented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of interest-rate risk (assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of tenpercent): In   Millions December31 2014 2013 Fixed-rate financing  potential loss in fair   value CMSEnergy,   including Consumers $247 $187 Consumers 151 129 The fair value losses in the above table could be realized only if CMSEnergy and Consumers transferred all of their fixed-rate financing to other creditors. The annual earnings exposure related to variable-rate financing was insignificant for both CMSEnergy and Consumers at December31,2014 and 2013, assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of tenpercent.
Investment Securities Price Risk: Through investments in equity securities, CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to equity price fluctuations. The following table shows the potential effect of adverse changes in equity prices on CMSEnergys and Consumers available-for-sale investments.
76 Table of Contents Presented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of investment securities price risk (assuming an adverse change in market prices of tenpercent): In   Millions December31 2014 2013 CMSEnergy, including Consumers Potential reduction in fair value of   available-for-sale securities DBSERP Mutual   funds $13 $14 Consumers Potential reduction in fair value of   available-for-sale securities DBSERP Mutual   funds $9 $10 CMSEnergy   common stock 4 3 Notes Receivable Risk: CMSEnergy is exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from EnerBanks fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank provides these loans to homeowners to finance home improvements.

For additional details on financial instruments, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
R ETIREMENT B ENEFITS Pension Plans: CMSEnergy and Consumers have external trust funds to provide retirement pension benefits to their employees under a non-contributory DBPension Plan. On July1, 2003, the Cash Balance Pension Plan was adopted for certain employees who were credited with five percent of their base pay. On September1,2005, the Cash Balance and DBPension Plans were closed to new participants and CMSEnergy and Consumers implemented the qualified DCCP, which provides an employer contribution of sixpercent of base pay to the existing 401(k)plan. An employee contribution is not required to receive the plans employer cash contribution. All employees hired on or after September1,2005 participate in this plan as part of their retirement benefit program. Additional pay credits under the previous Cash Balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of September1,2005. The participants of that plan now participate in the DCCP.
401(k)Plan: CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an employer match in their 401(k)plan equal to 60percent of eligible contributions up to the first sixpercent of an employees wages.
OPEB Plan: CMSEnergy and Consumers provide postretirement health and life benefits under their OPEB Plan to qualifying retired employees.
77 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:  life expectancies;  discount rates;  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets;  rate of compensation increases; and  expected health care costs.
A change in these assumptions could change significantly CMSEnergys and Consumers recorded liabilities and associated expenses.
Presented in the following table are estimates of CMSEnergys and Consumers DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan costs and cash contributions through 2017: In   Millions DBPension OPEB Plan DBPension   Plan OPEB Plan Plan Cost Cost(Credit ) Contribution Contribution CMSEnergy, including Consumers 2015 $105 $(28 ) $- $29 2016 96 (32 ) - - 2017 80 (29 ) - - Consumers 2015 $102 $(23 ) $- $29 2016 93 (26 ) - - 2017 78 (24 ) - - Projected retirement benefit costs have increased for 2015 and 2016 due primarily to changes in assumptions from December31,2013. At December31,2014, the discount rate for pension was lowered from 4.9percent to 4.1percent and for OPEB from 5.1percent to 4.3percent, resulting in an increase in CMSEnergys projected DBPension Plan costs of $18million and projected OPEBPlan costs of $10million for 2015, and an increase in Consumers projected DBPension Plan costs of $18million and projected OPEB Plan costs of $8million for 2015. Projected retirement benefits costs also reflect the use of the new RP-2014 mortality table, which accounts for a $27million increase in CMSEnergys projected DBPension Plan costs and a $21million increase in projected OPEB Plan costs for 2015, and a $26million increase in Consumers projected DBPension Plan costs and a $17million increase in projected OPEB Plan costs for 2015.
Contribution estimates comprise required amounts and discretionary contributions. Consumers pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process. Actual future costs and contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan participants.
Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the DBPension Plan assets by 0.25percentage point (from 7.50percent to 7.25percent) would increase estimated DBPension Plan cost for 2015 by $5million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25percentage point (from 4.10percent to 3.85percent) would increase estimated DBPension Plan cost for 2015 by $6million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers.

96 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: CMSEnergy and Consumers prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. CMSEnergys co nsolidated financial statements comprise CMSEnergy, Consumers, CMSEnterprises, and all other entities in which CMSEnergy has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Consumers consolidated financial statements comprise Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy uses the equity method of accounting for investments in companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they have significant influence over operations and financial policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy and Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.
Use of Estimates: CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Policy: CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize revenue from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the transportation, processing, and storage of natural gas, when services are provided. CMSEnergy and Consumers record unbilled revenue for the estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. CMSEnergy and Consumers record sales tax net and exclude it from revenue. CMSEnergy recognizes revenue on sales of marketed electricity, natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.
Alternative-Revenue Program: In 2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. The maximum incentive that Consumers may earn under this mechanism is 15percent of the amount it spends on energy optimization programs, which is limited to twopercent of Consumers retail revenue. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC.
Self-Implemented Rates: Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing if the MPSC has not issued an order in the case. The MPSC then has another six months to issue a final order. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within that period, the filed rates are considered approved. If the MPSC issues a final order within that period, the rates that Consumers self-implemented may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, then Consumers records a provision for revenue subject to refund.
EnerBank: EnerBank provides four types of unsecured consumer installment loans: same-as-cash, zero interest, reduced interest, and traditional. Under EnerBanks same-as-cash programs, authorized contractors pay EnerBank a fee to provide a borrower with the option to pay off the loan interest-free during the same-as-cash period. EnerBank recognizes the fee on a straight-line basis over the same-as-cash period, which typically ranges from three to 24months. If a borrower does not exercise its option to pay off its loan interest-free during the same-as-cash period, EnerBank charges the borrower accrued interest at the loans contractual rate on the outstanding balance from the origination date. Under the zero interest and reduced interest programs, authorized contractors pay EnerBank a fee to provide a borrower with no interest or reduced rates of interest for the entire term of the loan. EnerBank recognizes the fee using the interest method over the term of the loan, which ranges from one to 12years.
97 Table of Contents EnerBank recognizes interest income using the interest method and amortizes loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, over the loan term. EnerBank ceases recognizing interest income when a loan loss is confirmed or when a loan becomes 120days past due, at which time the loan principal is charged against the allowance for loan losses. At that time, EnerBank recognizes any interest accrued but not received for such loan losses as a reversal of interest income.
The loan fees and interest income earned by EnerBank are reported as operating revenue on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable comprise trade receivables and unbilled receivables. CMSEnergy and Consumers record their accounts receivable at cost, which approximates fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses, managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with customers. CMSEnergy and Consumers charge off accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers record estimated liabilities for contingencies on their consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. CMSEnergy and Consumers expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on estimates of work performed. This policy also applies to any fees incurred on behalf of employees and officers under indemnification agreements; such fees are billed directly to CMSEnergy or Consumers.
Debt Issuance Costs, Discounts, Premiums, and Refinancing Costs: Upon the issuance of long-term debt, CMSEnergy and Consumers defer issuance costs, discounts, and premiums and amortize those amounts over the terms of the associated debt. Upon the refinancing of long-term debt, Consumers, as a regulated entity, defers any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with the refinanced debt and amortizes those amounts over the term of the newly issued debt. For the non-regulated portions of CMSEnergys business, any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with extinguished debt are charged to earnings.
Derivative Instruments: In order to support ongoing operations, CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into contracts for the future purchase and sale of various commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, and coal. These forward contracts are generally long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of the commodity at a contracted price. Most of these contracts are not subject to derivative accounting because:  they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity or bcf of natural gas);  they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception; or  there is not an active market for the commodity.
Consumers coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is not an active market for the coal it purchases. If an active market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts may qualify as derivatives. Since Consumers is subject to regulatory accounting, the resulting fair value gains and losses would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and would not affect net income.
Consumers also uses FTRs to manage price risk related to electricity transmission congestion. An FTR is a financial instrument that entitles its holder to receive compensation or requires its holder to remit payment for congestion-related transmission charges. Consumers accounts for FTRs as derivatives. All 98 Table of Contents changes in fair value associated with FTRs are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities until the instruments are settled.
CMSEnergy and Consumers record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value on their consolidated balance sheets. Each reporting period, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. Since none of CMSEnergys or Consumers derivatives has been designated as an accounting hedge, all changes in fair value are either reported in earnings or deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. CMSEnergy and Consumers did not have significant amounts recorded as derivative assets or liabilities at December31,2014 or 2013. Additionally, the gains and losses recognized in earnings were not significant for the years ended December31,2014, 2013, or 2012.
Determination of MRV of Plan Assets for DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan: CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for DBPension Plan assets as the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMSEnergy and Consumers reflect each years gain or loss in the MRV in equal amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was determined. CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for OPEB Plan assets as the fair value of assets on the measurement date. CMSEnergy and Consumers use the MRV in the calculation of net DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan costs. For further details, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Earnings Per Share: CMSEnergy calculates basic and diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of non-vested stock awards and contingently convertible securities. CMSEnergy computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which are those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note15, Earnings Per Share  CMSEnergy.
Financial Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers record debt and equity securities classified as available for sale at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these securities are determined on a specific-identification basis. CMSEnergy and Consumers report unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings. For additional details regarding financial instruments, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMSEnergy and Consumers perform tests of impairment if certain triggering events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.
CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow analyses.
CMSEnergy also assesses equity method investments for impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This assessment requires CMSEnergy to determine the fair value of the equity method investment. CMSEnergy determines fair value using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment. CMSEnergy records an impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary.
99 Table of Contents Inventory: CMSEnergy and Consumers use the weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas, recoverable base gas in underground storage facilities, and materials and supplies inventory. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and they classify these amounts as generating plant fuel stock on their consolidated balance sheets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers account for RECs and emission allowances as inventory and use the weighted-average cost method to remove amounts from inventory. RECs and emission allowances are used to satisfy compliance obligations related to the generation of power.
CMSEnergy and Consumers use the lower-of-cost-or-market method to evaluate inventory for impairment.
MISO Transactions: MISO requires the submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. CMSEnergy and Consumers account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and day-ahead markets, netted across all MISO energy market locations. CMSEnergy and Consumers record net hourly purchases in purchased and interchange power and net hourly sales in operating revenue on their consolidated statements of income. They record net billing adjustments upon receipt of settlement statements, record accruals for future net purchases and sales adjustments based on historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses and sales upon receipt of settlement statements.
Property Taxes: Property taxes are based on the taxable value of Consumers real and personal property assessed by local taxing authorities. Consumers records property tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied based on Consumers budgeted customer sales. The deferred property tax balance represents the amount of Consumers accrued property tax that will be recognized over future governmental fiscal periods.
Reclassifications: CMSEnergy and Consumers have reclassified certain prior-period amounts on their consolidated financial statements to conform to the presentation for the current period. These reclassifications did not affect consolidated net income or cash flows for the periods presented.
Renewable Energy Grant: In 2013, Consumers received a renewable energy cash grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park under Section1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009. Upon receipt of the grant, Consumers recorded a regulatory liability, which Consumers is amortizing over the life of Lake Winds  Energy Park. Consumers presents the amortization as a reduction to maintenance and other operating expense. Consumers recorded the deferred income taxes related to the grant as a reduction of the book basis of Lake Winds  Energy Park.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents: CMSEnergy and Consumers have restricted cash and cash equivalents dedicated for repayment of Securitization bonds and for payment under performance guarantees. CMSEnergy and Consumers classify these amounts as a current asset if they relate to payments that could or will occur within one year.
100 Table of Contents 2: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS N EW A CCOUNTING S TANDARDS N OT Y ET E FFECTIVE ASU2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: This standard was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board as a result of a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board. The Boards developed a common revenue recognition model that will be applied under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The new guidance will replace most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in GAAP, although certain guidance specific to rate-regulated utilities will be retained. As issued, the standard will become effective January1,2017 for CMSEnergy and Consumers; however, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering a possible delay in the effective date. CMSEnergy and Consumers are evaluating the impact of the standard on their consolidated financial statements.
ASU2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period: This standard, which will become effective January1,2016 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, addresses certain types of stock awards with performance targets. The standard will apply to certain restricted stock awards granted by CMSEnergy and Consumers to retirement-eligible employees. CMSEnergy and Consumers do not expect the standard to have any impact on their consolidated financial statements since the guidance in the standard is consistent with the accounting presently applied to these awards.
3: REGULATORY MATTERS Regulatory matters are critical to Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers, such as Consumers rate cases and PSCR and GCR processes. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders. Depending upon the specific issues, the outcomes of rate cases and proceedings, including judicial proceedings challenging MPSC orders or other actions, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
There are multiple appeals pending that involve various issues concerning cost allocation among customers, the allocation of refunds among customer groups, the adequacy of the record evidence supporting the recovery of Smart Energy investments, and other matters. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of these appeals.
R EGULATORY A SSETS AND L IABILITIES Consumers is subject to the actions of the MPSC and FERC and therefore prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of regulatory accounting. A utility must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, Consumers records regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by non-regulated businesses.
101 Table of Contents Presented in the following table are the regulatory assets and liabilities on Consumers consolidated balance sheets: In Millions December31 EndofRecovery orRefundPeriod 2014 2013 Regulatory   assets Current Securitized costs  electric utility restructuring   legislation 1 2015 $ 61 $ - Energy optimization plan incentive 2 2015 17 17 Major maintenance 1 2015 8 - Cancelled coal-fueled plant costs 1 2015 2 5 Gas revenue decoupling mechanism 2 2014 - 17 Other 1 2015 1 1 Total   current regulatory assets $ 89 $ 40 Non-current Postretirement benefits 3 various $ 1,195 $ 634 Securitized costs  electric generating units to   be retired 1 2029 370 362 MGP sites 4 various 147 148 ARO 4 various 139 129 Unamortized debt costs 4 various 66 74 Gas storage inventory adjustments 4 various 21 23 Energy optimization plan incentive 2 2016 17 18 Securitized costs  electric utility restructuring   legislation 1 2015 - 129 Major maintenance 1 2015 - 10 Other 1 various 1 3 Total   non-current regulatory assets $ 1,956 $ 1,530 Total   regulatory assets $ 2,045 $ 1,570 Regulatory   liabilities Current Income taxes, net 2015 $ 64 $ 64 Renewable energy grant 2015 2 2 Other 2015 1 1 Total current regulatory liabilities $ 67 $ 67 Non-current Cost of removal various $ 1,673 $ 1,599 Renewable energy plan 2028 131 159 Income taxes, net various 103 157 ARO various 83 93 Renewable energy grant 2043 63 65 Energy optimization plan various 32 31 Postretirement benefits various - 98 Other various 10 13 Total   non-current regulatory liabilities $ 2,095 $ 2,215 Total   regulatory liabilities $ 2,162 $ 2,282 1 These regulatory assets either are included in rate base (or are expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case), thereby providing a return on expenditures, or provide a specific return on investment authorized by the MPSC.
2 These regulatory assets have arisen from alternative revenue programs and are not associated with incurred costs or capital investments. Therefore, the MPSC has provided for recovery without a return.
102 Table of Contents 3 This regulatory asset is offset partially by liabilities. The net amount is included in rate base, thereby providing a return.
4 These regulatory assets represent incurred costs for which the MPSC has provided, or Consumers expects, recovery without a return on investment.
R EGULATORY A SSETS Securitized Costs  Electric Utility Restructuring Legislation: In 2000, the MPSC authorized Consumers to securitize certain qualified costs incurred as a result of electric utility restructuring legislation. Consumers is amortizing this regulatory asset over the life of the related Securitization bonds.
Energy Optimization Plan Incentive: In May2014, Consumers filed its annual report and reconciliation for its energy optimization plan, requesting approval of its energy optimization plan costs for 2013. In November2014, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to collect $18million from customers during 2015 as an incentive payment for exceeding statutory targets under both its gas and electric energy optimization plans during 2013.
During 2014, Consumers achieved 135percent of its electric savings target and 129percent of its gas savings target. For achieving these savings levels, Consumers will request the MPSCs approval to collect $17million, the maximum incentive, in the energy optimization reconciliation to be filed in 2015.
Major Maintenance: In its2012 order in Consumers electric rate case, the MPSC allowed Consumers to defer major maintenance costs associated with its electric generating units in excess of the costs approved in the rate order and to recover those excess costs from customers, subject to MPSC approval. In November2014, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to recover $10million of such excess costs over a six-month period beginning December2014.
Cancelled Coal-Fueled Plant Costs: In its 2012 order in Consumers electric rate case, the MPSC authorized recovery over a three-year period of $14million of development costs associated with Consumers cancelled 830-MW coal-fueled plant. In 2012, a party in Consumers electric rate case filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals to dispute the MPSCs conclusion that authorized Consumers to recover these costs. In April2014, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the MPSCs conclusion, which can no longer be appealed and is closed.
Gas Revenue Decoupling Mechanism: The MPSCs 2009 order in Consumers gas rate case authorized Consumers to implement a gas revenue decoupling mechanism. This mechanism, which the MPSC extended through April2012 in its 2010 order in Consumers gas rate case, allowed Consumers to adjust future gas rates to the degree that actual average weather-adjusted sales per customer differed from the rate order. In 2013, the MPSC approved Consumers final reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism and Consumers collected $17million during 2014.
Postretirement Benefits: As part of the ratemaking process, the MPSC allows Consumers to recover the costs of postretirement benefits. Accordingly, Consumers defers the net impact of actuarial losses and gains as well as prior service costs and credits associated with postretirement benefits as a regulatory asset or liability. The asset or liability will decrease as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
For details about the amortization periods, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Securitized Costs  Electric Generating Units to be Retired: In December2013, the MPSC issued a Securitization financing order authorizing Consumers to issue Securitization bonds in order to finance the recovery of the remaining book value of seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers plans to retire in April2016 and three smaller natural gas-fueled electric generating units that it plans to retire in June2015. Upon receipt of the MPSCs order, Consumers removed the book value of 103 Table of Contents the ten units from plant, property, and equipment and recorded this amount as a regulatory asset. Consumers is amortizing the regulatory asset over the life of the related Securitization bonds, which it issued through its subsidiary Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding in July2014. For additional details regarding the Securitization bonds, see Note5, Financings and Capitalization.
MGP Sites : Consumers is incurring environmental remediation and other response activity costs at 23 former MGP facilities. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover from its natural gas customers over a ten-year period the costs incurred to remediate the MGP sites.
ARO: The recovery of the underlying asset investments and related removal costs of recorded AROs is approved by the MPSC in depreciation rate cases. Consumers records a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability for timing differences between the recognition of AROs for financial reporting purposes and the recovery of these costs from customers. The recovery period approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed.
Unamortized Debt Costs: Under regulatory accounting, any unamortized debt costs related to debt redeemed with the proceeds of new debt are capitalized and amortized over the life of the new debt.
Gas Storage Inventory Adjustments: Consumers incurs inventory expenses related to the loss of gas from its natural gas storage fields. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover these costs from its natural gas customers over a five-year period.
R EGULATORY L IABILITIES Income Taxes, Net: These costs represent the difference between deferred income taxes recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts previously reflected in Consumers rates. This net balance will decrease over the remaining life of the related temporary differences and flow through current income tax benefit.
In September2013, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to accelerate the flow-through to electric and gas customers of certain income tax benefits associated primarily with the cost of removal of plant placed in service before 1993. The order authorized Consumers to implement a regulatory treatment beginning January2014 that will return $209million of income tax benefits over fiveyears to electric customers and $260million of income tax benefits over 12years to gas customers. During 2014, Consumers returned $64million of income tax benefits to customers.
Renewable Energy Grant: In2013, Consumers received a $69million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park, which began operations in2012. This grant reduces Consumers cost of complying with the renewable portfolio standards prescribed by the 2008 Energy Law and, accordingly, reduces the overall renewable energy surcharge to be collected from customers. The regulatory liability recorded for the grant will be amortized over the life of Lake Winds  Energy Park.
Cost of Removal: These amounts have been collected from customers to fund future asset removal activities.
This regulatory liability is reduced as costs of removal are incurred. The refund period of this regulatory liability approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed.
Renewable Energy Plan: Consumers has collected surcharges to fund its renewable energy plan. Amounts not yet spent under the plan are recorded as a regulatory liability, which is amortized as incremental costs are incurred to operate and depreciate Consumers wind parks and to purchase RECs under renewable energy purchase agreements. Incremental costs represent costs incurred in excess of amounts recovered through the PSCR process.
104 Table of Contents Energy Optimization Plan: At December31,2014 and 2013, surcharges collected from customers to fund Consumers energy optimization plan exceeded Consumers spending. The associated regulatory liability is amortized as costs are incurred under Consumers energy optimization plan.
P OWER S UPPLY C OST R ECOVERY AND G AS C OST R ECOVERY The PSCR and GCR ratemaking processes are designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply and purchased natural gas costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR and GCR billing charges monthly in order to minimize the underrecovery or overrecovery amount in the annual reconciliations.
Underrecoveries represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers and are included in accrued gas revenue on Consumers consolidated balance sheets. Overrecoveries represent previously collected revenues that will be refunded to customers and are included in accrued rate refunds on Consumers consolidated balance sheets. Presented in the following table are the assets and liabilities for PSCR and GCR underrecoveries and overrecoveries reflected on Consumers consolidated balance sheets: In Millions December31 2014 2013 Accrued gas revenue $ 27 $ - Accrued rate refunds 6 12 PSCR Plans and Reconciliations: In May2014, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2012PSCR reconciliation, approving full recovery of $1.9billion of power costs and authorizing Consumers to roll into its 2013PSCR plan the underrecovery of $18million.
Consumers submitted its 2013PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2012, and in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2013PSCR factor beginning in January2013. In March2014, Consumers filed its 2013PSCR reconciliation, requesting full recovery of $1.9billion of power costs and authorization to roll into its 2014PSCR plan the overrecovery of $10million.
Consumers submitted its 2014 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2013, and in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2014PSCR factor beginning in January2014. Consumers power supply costs for 2014 were significantly higher than those projected in its 2014 PSCR plan due to severe winter weather during the three months ended March31,2014, as extreme cold weather and heavy snowfall inhibited the delivery and use of coal at Consumers coal-fueled generating units. Additionally, increases in natural gas prices raised the cost of electricity purchased from the MISO energy market as well as the cost of power generated at Consumers natural gas-fueled generating units. Consumers filed an amendment to its 2014PSCR plan in March2014, requesting approval to increase the 2014PSCR factor. Consumers self-implemented the revised factor in July2014. Consumers had a $6million PSCR overrecovery at December31,2014.
GCR Plans and Reconciliations: In September2014, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2012-2013GCR reconciliation, approving full recovery of $0.9billion in gas costs and authorizing Consumers to roll into its 2013-2014GCR plan the underrecovery of $22million.
The MPSC approved Consumers 2013-2014GCR plan in July2014, authorizing the 2013-2014GCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in April2013. Due to the impact on natural gas prices of extended periods of colder-than-normal winter weather in Michigan and throughout the United States during the three months ended March31,2014, Consumers natural gas fuel costs for this period were significantly higher than those projected in its 2013-2014 GCR plan. As a result, Consumers calculated an $84million underrecovery for the 2013-2014 GCR plan year. In the reconciliation it filed in 105 Table of Contents June2014, Consumers requested full recovery of $0.9billion of gas costs and authorization to roll into its 2014-2015GCR plan the underrecovery of $84million.
Consumers submitted its 2014-2015 GCR plan in December2013, and in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2014-2015GCR factor beginning in April2014. Due to the significant underrecovery Consumers experienced during the 2013-2014 GCR plan year, Consumers filed an amendment to its 2014-2015 GCR plan in February2014, requesting approval to increase the 2014-2015GCR factor to be charged to customers. In May2014, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to charge the increased factor to customers until the MPSC issues a final order in Consumers 2014-2015GCR plan. Consumers had a $27million GCR underrecovery recorded at December31,2014.
4: CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS CMSEnergy and Consumers are involved in various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. Depending on the specific issues, the resolution of these contingencies could have a material effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In their disclosures of these matters, CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss when such an estimate can be made. Disclosures that state that CMSEnergy or Consumers cannot predict the outcome of a matter indicate that they are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss for the matter.
CMS E NERGY C ONTINGENCIES Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation: CMSEnergy, along with CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas,Inc., and Cantera Gas Company, have been named as defendants in five class action lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting to publications that report trade information. Allegations include manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The following provides more detail on the cases in which CMS Energy or its affiliates remain as parties:  In 2005, CMSEnergy, CMSMST, and CMSField Services were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in Kansas state court, Learjet,Inc., etal. v. Oneok,Inc., etal. The complaint alleges that during the putative class period, January1,2000 through October31,2002, the defendants engaged in a scheme to violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiffs are seeking statutory full consideration damages consisting of the full consideration paid by the plaintiffs for natural gas allegedly purchased from the defendants.
In 2007, a class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical Center, etal. v. Oneok,Inc. etal., was filed as a putative class action in Missouri state court alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws. The defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSField Services, and CMSMST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri antitrust law in connection with their natural gas reporting activities. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration damages and treble damages.
In 2006, a class action complaint, ArandellCorp., etal. v. XCELEnergyInc., etal., was filed in Wisconsin state court on behalf of Wisconsin commercial entities that purchased natural gas between January1,2000 and October31,2002. The defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSERM, and Cantera Gas Company, are alleged to have violated Wisconsins antitrust statute. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration damages, plus exemplary damages and attorneys fees.
106 Table of Contents  In 2009, a class action complaint, NewpageWisconsin System v. CMSERM, etal., was filed in circuit court in Wood County, Wisconsin, against CMSEnergy, CMSERM, Cantera Gas Company, and others. The plaintiff is seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs, interest, and attorneys fees.
In 2005, J.P.Morgan Trust Company,N.A., in its capacity as trustee of the FLILiquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas state court against CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, and others. The complaint alleges various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiff is seeking statutory full consideration damages for its purchases of natural gas in 2000 and 2001.
After removal to federal court, all of the cases described above were transferred to the MDL. In 2010 and 2011, all claims against CMSEnergy defendants in the MDL cases were dismissed based on FERC preemption. Plaintiffs filed appeals in all of the cases. The issues on appeal were whether the district court erred in dismissing the cases based on FERC preemption and denying the plaintiffs motions for leave to amend their complaints to add a federal Sherman Act antitrust claim. The plaintiffs did not appeal the dismissal of CMSEnergy as a defendant in these cases, but other CMSEnergy entities remain as defendants.
In April2013, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the MDL decision and remanded the case to the MDL judge for further proceedings. The appellate court found that FERC preemption does not apply under the facts of these cases. The appellate court affirmed the MDL courts denial of leave to amend to add federal antitrust claims.
In August2013, the joint defense group in these cases, of which CMSEnergy defendants are members, filed a petition with the U.S.Supreme Court in an attempt to overturn the decision of the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In July2014, the U.S.Supreme Court agreed to hear this case. Arguments were heard in early 2015 and an opinion is expected in the first half of 2015.
These cases involve complex facts, a large number of similarly situated defendants with different factual positions, and multiple jurisdictions. Presently, any estimate of liability would be highly speculative; the amount of CMSEnergys possible loss would be based on widely varying models previously untested in this context. If the outcome after appeals is unfavorable, these cases could have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Bay Harbor: CMSEnergy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate, a liquid consisting of water and other substances, at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. In 2012, CMSEnergy and the MDEQ finalized an agreement that established the final remedies and the future water quality criteria at the site. CMSEnergy has completed all construction necessary to implement the remedies required by the agreement and will continue to maintain and operate a system to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay under an NPDES permit issued in 2010. This permit requires renewal every fiveyears.
Various claims have been brought against CMSLand or its affiliates, including CMSEnergy, alleging environmental damage to property, loss of property value, insufficient disclosure of environmental matters, breach of agreement relating to access, or other matters. CMSLand and other parties have received a demand for payment from the EPA in the amount of $8million, plus interest. The EPA is seeking recovery under CERCLA of response costs allegedly incurred at Bay Harbor. These costs exceed what was agreed to in a 2005 order between CMSLand and the EPA, and CMSLand has communicated to the EPA that it does not believe that this is a valid claim. In August2014, the EPA indicated that it intends to pursue the claim.
107 Table of Contents In September2014, CMSEnergy recorded a charge of $15million to maintenance and other operating expenses to increase the remaining liability for Bay Harbor as a result of changed cost estimates based on recent experience. Factors leading to the increase included higher water treatment costs, more frequent trucking of water due to system limitations, and increased system maintenance costs. CMSEnergy has recorded a cumulative charge related to Bay Harbor of $245million, which includes accretion expense. At December31,2014, CMSEnergy had a recorded liability of $62million for its remaining obligations. CMSEnergy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of 4.34percent and an inflation rate of onepercent on annual operating and maintenance costs. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $80million. CMSEnergy expects to pay $8million in 2015, $6million in 2016, $5million in 2017, $5million in 2018, and $5million in 2019, and the remaining amount thereafter on long-term liquid disposal and operating and maintenance costs. CMSEnergys estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are changes in circumstances or assumptions used in calculating the liability.
Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMSEnergy cannot predict the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter.
Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim: In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $142million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale and may proceed to formal arbitration. CMSEnergy has concluded that the governments tax claim is without merit. CMSEnergy is vigorously contesting the claim but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. It is possible that the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY C ONTINGENCIES Electric Environmental Matters: Consumers operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Historically, Consumers has generally been able to recover, in customer rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations.
Cleanup and Solid Waste: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under NREPA. Consumers believes that these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers estimates that its liability for NREPA sites for which it can estimate a range of loss will be between $4million and $6million. At December31,2014, Consumers had a recorded liability of $4million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability.
Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under CERCLA. CERCLA liability is joint and several. In 2010, Consumers received official notification from the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party for cleanup of PCBs at the Kalamazoo River CERCLA site. The notification claimed that the EPA has reason to believe that Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. In 2011, Consumers received a follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek, which is connected to the Kalamazoo River. All parties, including Consumers, that were asked to participate in the removal action plan declined to accept liability. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river.
Based on its experience, Consumers estimates that its share of the total liability for known CERCLA sites will be between $3million and $9million. Various factors, including the number of potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect Consumers share of the total liability. At 108 Table of Contents December31,2014, Consumers had a recorded liability of $3million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable CERCLA liability.
The timing of payments related to Consumers remediation and other response activities at its CERCLA and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and CERCLA liability.
Ludington PCB: In 1998, during routine maintenance activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB material. Consumers has had several communications with the EPA regarding this matter. Consumers cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues and Notices of Violation: In 2007, Consumers received an NOV/FOV from the EPA alleging that fourteen utility boilers exceeded the visible emission limits in their associated air permits. Consumers responded formally to the NOV/FOV, denying the allegations. In addition, in 2008, Consumers received an NOV for three of its coal-fueled facilities alleging, among other things, violations of NSR PSD regulations relating to ten projects from 1986 to 1998 purportedly subject to review under the NSR. Additionally, the EPA has alleged that some utilities have classified incorrectly major plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the EPA or state regulatory agencies to modify their plants. Consumers responded to the information requests from the EPA on this subject in the past.
In September2014, Consumers reached a settlement in this matter with the EPA and the U.S.Department of Justice. Under the settlement, Consumers shall, among other things, install pollution control equipment at some of its coal-fueled electric generating plants and achieve certain emission rates for specific pollutants, surrender emission allowances, invest in $7.7million of Environmental Mitigation Projects, retire or repower certain coal-fueled units, and pay a civil penalty of $2.75million. Consumers has accrued an amount sufficient to cover the costs of the civil penalty and some of the Environmental Mitigation Projects. Consumers has recovered or expects that it would be able to recover some or all of the costs in rates, consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations, but cannot reasonably estimate the extent of additional cost recovery. The settlement, completed via consent decree, was finalized in November2014.
CCRs: In December2014, the EPA issued a final ruleregulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The final rulewill adopt non-hazardous waste standards for CCRs. The rulewill add new requirements for groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust, and public disclosure of information. The rulewill also require closure of non-compliant surface impoundments and landfills within approximately three years, with limited potential for extensions. The ruleis expected to be published in early 2015. Consumers expects that planned capital expenditures will likely be accelerated to meet the compliance deadline, but is still evaluating the impacts of this rule.
Renewable Energy Matters: In April2013, a group of landowners filed a lawsuit in Mason County (Michigan) Circuit Court alleging, among other things, personal injury, loss of property value, and impacts to the use and enjoyment of their land as a result of the operations of Lake Winds  Energy Park. In October2014, Consumers reached a settlement with a majority of the plaintiffs, and in January2015, reached a settlement with the remaining plaintiffs, neither of which was material to Consumers.
109 Table of Contents C ONSUMERS G AS U TILITY C ONTINGENCIES Gas Environmental Matters: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under the NREPA. These sites include 23former MGP facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites, Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a portion of the original site.
At December31,2014, Consumers had a recorded liability of $115million for its remaining obligations for these sites. This amount represents the present value of long-term projected costs, using a discount rate of 2.57percent and an inflation rate of 2.5percent. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $131million. Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs in each of the next fiveyears as follows: In Millions 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Consumers Remediation and other response activity costs $ 11 $ 12 $ 13 $ 11 $ 14 Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability.
Pursuant to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers over a ten-year period. At December31,2014, Consumers had a regulatory asset of $147million related to the MGP sites.
Consumers estimates that its liability to perform remediation and other response activities at NREPA sites other than the MGP sites could reach $3million. At December31,2014, Consumers had a recorded liability of less than $1million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable liability.

These factors include unspecified exposure under certain agreements. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to these indemnities to be remote.
O THER C ONTINGENCIES Other: In addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and Note3, Regulatory Matters, there are certain other lawsuits and administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies arising in the ordinary course of business to which CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMSEnergy are parties. These other lawsuits and proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage, contracts, environmental matters, federal and state taxes, rates, licensing, employment, and other matters. Further, CMSEnergy and Consumers occasionally self-report certain regulatory non-compliance matters that may or may not eventually result in administrative proceedings. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that the outcome of any one of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

FMBs: Consumers secures its FMBs by a mortgage and lien on substantially all of its property. Consumers ability to issue FMBs is restricted by certain provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the need for regulatory approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture include achieving a two-times interest coverage ratio and having sufficient unfunded net property additions.
Regulatory Authorization for Financings: Consumers is required to maintain FERC authorization for financings. In June2014, Consumers received authorization from FERC to have outstanding, at any one time, up to $800million of secured and unsecured short-term securities for general corporate purposes. At December31,2014, Consumers had entered into short-term borrowing programs allowing it to issue up to $800million in short-term securities; $60million of securities were outstanding under these programs. FERC has also authorized Consumers to issue and sell up to $1.9billion of secured and unsecured long-term securities for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability was $1.4billion at December31,2014. The authorizations were effective July1,2014 and terminate 115 Table of Contents June30,2016. Any long-term issuances during the authorization period are exempt from FERCs competitive bidding and negotiated placement requirements.
Securitization Bonds: Certain regulatory assets held by two of Consumers subsidiaries, Consumers Funding and Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding, collateralize Consumers Securitization bonds. The bondholders have no recourse to Consumers assets except for those held by the subsidiary that issued the bonds. Consumers collects Securitization surcharges to cover the principal and interest on the bonds as well as certain other qualified costs. The surcharges collected are remitted to a trustee and are not available to creditors of Consumers or creditors of Consumers affiliates other than the subsidiary that issued the bonds.

2 Obligations under this facility are secured by FMBs of Consumers.
Short-term Borrowings: Under Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may transfer up to $250million of accounts receivable, subject to certain eligibility requirements. These transactions are accounted for as short-term secured borrowings. At December31,2014, no accounts receivable had been transferred under the program. During the year ended December31,2014, Consumers average short-term borrowings totaled $11million, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.85percent.
In September2014, Consumers entered into a commercial paper program. Under the program, Consumers may issue, in one or more placements, commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days and that bear interest at fixed or floating rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers $650million revolving credit facility and may have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of up to $500million. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the revolvers available capacity, Consumers would not issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available revolver capacity. At December31,2014, $60million of commercial paper notes were outstanding under this program, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.49percent.

Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at December31,2014, Consumers had $768million of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that under a variety of circumstances dividends from Consumers on its common stock would not be limited to amounts in Consumers retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay dividends on its common stock in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would be subject to a formal regulatory filing process.
For the year ended December31,2014, Consumers paid $457million in dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy.
Capitalization: The authorized capital stock of CMSEnergy consists of:  350million shares of CMSEnergy Common Stock, par value $0.01per share, and  10million shares of CMSEnergy Preferred Stock, par value $0.01per share.
Issuance of Common Stock: In April2013, CMSEnergy entered into a continuous equity offering program permitting it to sell, from time to time in at the market offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $50million.

When measuring fair value, CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  Level1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other than Level1 prices. Level2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in inactive markets, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMSEnergys or Consumers own assumptions about how market participants would value their assets and liabilities.
To the extent possible, CMSEnergy and Consumers use quoted market prices or other observable market pricing data in valuing assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If this information is unavailable, they use market-corroborated data or reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. CMSEnergy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

118 Table of Contents Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents consist of money market funds with daily liquidity. Short-term debt instruments classified as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets are not included since they are recorded at amortized cost.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities: The nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of mutual funds, which are valued using the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund. CMSEnergy and Consumers value their nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect what is owed to the plan participants in accordance with their investment elections. CMSEnergy and Consumers report the assets in other non-current assets and the liabilities in other non-current liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets.
DBSERP Assets: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their DBSERP assets using a market approach that incorporates quoted market prices. The DBSERP cash equivalents consist of a money market fund with daily liquidity. The DBSERP invests in mutual funds that hold primarily fixed-income instruments of varying maturities. In order to meet their investment objectives, the funds hold investment-grade debt securities, and may invest a portion of their assets in high-yield securities, foreign debt, and derivative instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers value these funds using the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund. CMSEnergy and Consumers report their DBSERP assets in other non-current assets on their consolidated balance sheets. For additional details about DBSERP securities, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their derivative instruments using either a market approach that incorporates information from market transactions, or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount. CMSEnergy values its exchange-traded derivative contracts based on Level1 quoted prices and values other derivatives using Level2 inputs, which include commodity forward prices and credit risk factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers have classified certain derivatives as Level3 since the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions.
The majority of derivatives classified as Level3 are FTRs held by Consumers. Due to the lack of quoted pricing information, Consumers determines the fair value of its FTRs based on Consumers average historical settlements.

3 Includes current portion of long-term debt of $124million at December31,2014 and $43million at December31,2013.
Notes receivable consist of EnerBanks fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank estimates the fair value of these loans using a discounted cash flows technique that incorporates market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining life of the loans and credit risk.
CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of their long-term debt using quoted prices from market trades of the debt, if available. In the absence of quoted prices, CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate market yields and prices for the debt using a matrix method that incorporates market data for similarly rated debt. Depending on the information available, other valuation techniques and models may be used that rely on assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions.
The effects of third-party credit enhancements are excluded from the fair value measurements of long-term debt. At December31,2014 and 2013, CMSEnergys long-term debt included $103million principal amount that was supported by third-party credit enhancements. This entire principal amount was at Consumers.

Realized gains and losses on the sales were not significant for either CMSEnergy or Consumers during each period.
Consumers recognized gains of $4million in 2013 and $5million in 2012 from transferring shares of CMSEnergy common stock to a related charitable foundation. The gains reflected the excess of fair value over cost of the stock donated and were recorded in other income on Consumers consolidated statements of income.
122 Table of Contents 8: NOTES RECEIVABLE Presented in the following table are details of CMSEnergys and Consumers current and non-current notes receivable: In   Millions December31 2014 2013 CMS   Energy, including Consumers Current EnerBank   notes receivable, net of allowance for loan losses $ 97 $ 48 EnerBank   notes receivable held for sale 41 - Other 1 15 Non-current EnerBank   notes receivable, net of allowance for loan losses 800 635 Total   notes receivable $ 939 $ 698 Consumers Current Other $ - $ 14 Total   notes receivable $ - $ 14 EnerBank notes receivable are unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank records its notes receivable at cost, less allowance for loan losses. At December31,2014, $41million of notes receivable were reclassified to held for sale; the fair value of notes receivable held for sale exceeded their carrying value. These notes are expected to be sold in 2015.
The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to reflect estimated credit losses. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance required by taking into consideration historical loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the loss is confirmed, but no later than the point at which a loan becomes 120days past due.

CMSEnergy and Consumers record planned major maintenance activities as operating expense unless the cost represents the acquisition of additional long-lived assets or the replacement of an existing long-lived asset.
Consumers depreciates utility property on an asset-group basis, in which it applies a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to the gross investment in a particular class of property within the electric and gas segments. Consumers performs depreciation studies periodically to determine appropriate group lives. Presented in the following table are the composite depreciation rates for Consumers segment properties: Years   Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 Electric   utility property 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.2 % Gas   utility property 2.8 % 2.8 % 2.9 % Other   property 7.7 % 7.0 % 7.2 % CMSEnergy and Consumers record plant, property, and equipment at original cost when placed into service. The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, overhead such as pension and other benefits, and AFUDC, if applicable. Consumers plant, property, and equipment is generally recoverable through its general rate making process. For additional details, see Note3, Regulatory Matters.
With the exception of utility property for which the remaining book value has been securitized, mothballed utility property stays in rate base and continues to be depreciated at the same rate as before the mothball period. When utility property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal, net of salvage. CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize gains or losses on the retirement or 125 Table of Contents disposal of non-regulated assets in income. Consumers records cost of removal collected from customers, but not spent, as a regulatory liability.
Consumers capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction projects, except pollution control facilities on its fossil-fuel-fired power plants. AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and authorized return-on-equity funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers records the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed funds component and as other income for the equity funds component on the consolidated statements of income. When construction is completed and the property is placed in service, Consumers depreciates and recovers the capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of the related asset. Presented in the following table are Consumers composite AFUDC capitalization rates: Years   Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 AFUDC   capitalization rate 7.2 % 7.3 % 7.3 % CMSEnergy and Consumers capitalize the purchase and development of internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed evenly over the estimated useful life of the internal-use computer software. If computer software is integral to computer hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the hardware. The types of costs capitalized are consistent for all periods presented by the financial statements.

10: LEASES CMSEnergy and Consumers lease various assets, including railcars, service vehicles, gas pipeline capacity, and buildings. In addition, CMSEnergy and Consumers account for a number of their PPAs as capital and operating leases.
Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have original lease terms ranging from one to 15years, expiring without extension provisions over the next tenyears and with extension provisions over the next 12years. These leases contain fair market value extension and buyout provisions. Capital leases for Consumers vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of 120months with some having end-of-lease rental adjustment clauses based on the proceeds received from the sale or disposition of the vehicles, and others having fixed percentage purchase options.
Consumers has capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the D.E.Karn generating complex and Zeeland. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the D.E.Karn generating complex has a term of 15years with a provision to extend the contract from month to month. The remaining term of the contract was sevenyears at December31,2014. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline to Zeeland has a term of fiveyears with a renewal provision of an additional fiveyears at the end of the contract. The remaining term of the contract was threeyears at December31,2014. The remaining terms 127 Table of Contents of Consumers long-term PPAs accounted for as leases range between one and 18years.

Consumers has continuing involvement with Palisades through security provided to Entergy for Consumers PPA obligation and other arrangements. Because of these ongoing arrangements, Consumers accounted for the transaction as a financing of Palisades and not a sale. Accordingly, no gain on the sale of Palisades was recognized on the consolidated statements of income. Consumers accounted for the remaining non-real-estate assets and liabilities associated with the transaction as a sale.
Palisades remains on Consumers consolidated balance sheets and Consumers continues to depreciate it. Consumers recorded the related proceeds as a finance obligation with payments recorded to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades PPA. The value of the finance obligation was determined based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair values of the net assets sold and fair value of the plant asset under the financing. Total amortization and interest charges under the financing were $19million for the year ended December31,2014 and $20million for each of the years ended December31,2013 and December31,2012.
128 Table of Contents 11: ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS CMSEnergy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. No market risk premiums were included in CMSEnergys and Consumers ARO fair value estimates since reasonable estimates could not be made. If a fivepercent market risk premium were assumed, CMSEnergys and Consumers ARO liabilities would be $17million higher at December31,2014 and $16million higher at December31,2013. In 2013, Consumers updated the ARO for asbestos abatement to reflect a revised estimate of future obligations at its steam electric generating units. In 2014, Consumers recorded the initial estimate of $3million for closure of the Cross Winds  Energy Park.
If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMSEnergy and Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.
Presented below are the categories of assets that CMSEnergy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove at the end of their useful lives and for which they have an ARO liability recorded: In-Service Company and ARO Description Date Long-Lived Assets CMSEnergy, including   Consumers Closure of gas treating plant and gas wells Various Gas transmission and storage Closure of coal ash disposal areas Various Generating plants coal ash areas Asbestos abatement 1973 Electric and gas utility plant Gas distribution cut, purge, and cap Various Gas distribution mains and services Closure of wind parks 2012, 2014 Wind generation facilities Consumers Closure of coal ash disposal areas Various Generating plants coal ash areas Asbestos abatement 1973 Electric and gas utility plant Gas distribution cut, purge, and cap Various Gas distribution mains and services Closure of wind parks 2012, 2014 Wind generation facilities No assets have been restricted for purposes of settling AROs.

OPEB Plan: Participants in the OPEB Plan include all regular full-time employees covered by the employee health care plan on the day before retirement from either CMSEnergy or Consumers at age 55 or older with at least ten full years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees who qualify for DBPension Plan disability retirement and have 15years of applicable continuous service may also participate in the OPEB Plan. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption that costs would increase 6.5percent in 2015 and 2014. The rate of increase was assumed to decline to 4.75percent by 2024 and thereafter.
The assumptions used in the health care cost-trend rate affect service, interest, and PBO costs.

This analysis incorporated the projected benefit payments specific to CMSEnergys and Consumers DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan and the yields on high quality corporate bonds rated Aa or better.
2 The mortality assumption for 2014 for benefit obligations was based on the new RP-2014 mortality table, with projection scale MP-2014. The mortality assumption for 2013 and 2012 was based on the RP-2000 mortality tables with projection of future mortality improvements using ScaleAA, which aligned with the IRS prescriptions for cash funding valuations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The mortality assumption for all three years for net periodic benefit cost was based on the RP-2000 mortality table.
3 CMSEnergy and Consumers determined the long-term rate of return using historical market returns, the present and expected future economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with financial market knowledge. CMSEnergy and Consumers considered the asset allocation of the portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of the portfolio. The goal was to determine a long-term rate of return that could be incorporated into the planning of future cash flow requirements in conjunction with the change in the liability. Annually, CMSEnergy and Consumers review for reasonableness and appropriateness the forecasted returns for various classes of assets used to construct an expected return model. CMSEnergys and Consumers expected long-term rate of return on DBPension Plan assets was 7.5percent in 2014. The actual return on DBPension Plan assets was 7.4percent in 2014, 12.5percent in 2013, and 14.1percent in 2012.

The estimated period of amortization of gains and losses for CMSEnergy and Consumers was tenyears for the DBPension Plan for the years ended December31,2014 and 2013 and 11years for the DBPension Plan for the year ended December31,2012 and 13years for OPEB for the years ended December31,2014, 2013, and 2012. Prior service cost (credit) amortization is established in the year in which the prior service cost (credit) first occurred, and is based on the same amortization period for all future years until the prior service cost (credit) is fully amortized. CMSEnergy and Consumers had a new prior service credit for OPEB in 2013. The estimated period of amortization of this new prior service credit for CMSEnergy and Consumers is tenyears.

At December31,2013, $86million of the total funded status of the DBPension Plan was attributable to Consumers, based on an allocation of expenses.
2 Plan amendments resulted from changing the Medicare drug program provided through the OPEB Plan from an employer-sponsored prescription drug plan with a retiree drug subsidy to an EGWP that began on January1,2015, and from certain benefit changes to the OPEB Plan, to begin on January1,2016.
3 CMSEnergy received payments of $4million in 2014 and $5million in each of 2013 and 2012 for the Medicare PartD subsidies. Consumers received payments of $4million in each of 2014 and 2013 and $5million in 2012 for the Medicare PartD subsidies. The Medicare PartD subsidy payments are used to pay OPEB Plan benefits.
134 Table of Contents As part of the annual measurement of benefit obligations, CMSEnergy recorded an actuarial loss at December31,2014 of $458million for the DBPension Plan and $230million for the OPEB Plan. Consumers recorded an actuarial loss at December31,2014 of $223million for the OPEB Plan. Recognition of these actuarial losses at December31,2014 increased CMSEnergys and Consumers benefit obligations and decreased the funded status of the plans. The changes were primarily the result of lowering the discount rates used in calculating the plans obligation and using the RP-2014 mortality table.

U.S.Government and Agencies Securities: U.S.government and agencies securities consist of U.S.Treasury notes and other debt securities backed by the U.S.government and related agencies. These securities were valued based on quoted market prices.
Corporate Debt: Corporate debt investments consisted of investment grade bonds of U.S.issuers from diverse industries. These securities are valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or yields presently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
State and Municipal Bonds: State and municipal bonds were valued using a matrix-pricing model that incorporates Level2 market-based information. The fair value of the bonds was derived from various observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported securities trades, broker/dealer quotes, bond ratings, and general information on market movements for investment grade state and municipal securities normally considered by market participants when pricing such debt securities.
Foreign Corporate Bonds: Foreign corporate debt securities were valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or on yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
137 Table of Contents Common Stocks: Common stocks in the OPEB Plan consist of equity securities with low transaction costs that were actively managed and tracked by the S&P500 Index. These securities were valued at their quoted closing prices.
Mutual Funds: Mutual funds represent shares in registered investment companies that are priced based on the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in the funds.
Pooled Funds: Pooled funds include both common and collective trust funds as well as special funds that contain only employee benefit plan assets from two or more unrelated benefit plans. Presented in the following table are the investment components of these funds: DBPensionPlan OPEBPlan December31 2014 2013 2014 2013 U.S. equity securities 64 % 61 % 62 % 60 % Foreign equity securities 16 28 12 20 U.S. fixed-income securities 9 4 18 14 Foreign fixed-income securities 6 3 5 4 Alternative investments 5 4 3 2 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % These investments were valued at the quoted NAV provided by the fund managers that is the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in the funds.
CMSEnergys target asset allocation for DBPension Plan assets is 50percent equity, 30percent fixed income, and 20percent alternative-strategy investments. This target asset allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&P MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers as well as high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are diversified across absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset allocation. CMSEnergy and Consumers use annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocation.
CMSEnergy and Consumers established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund their future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries. CMSEnergys and Consumers target asset allocation for these trusts is 50percent equity, 20percent fixed income, and 30percent alternative-strategy investments. CMSEnergy and Consumers plan to adjust their target asset allocation in 2015 to 50percent equity, 25percent fixed income, and 25percent alternative strategy investments. This target allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&PSmallCap Index and Foreign Equity Funds.

2 Neither CMSEnergy nor Consumers plans to contribute to the DBPension Plan in 2015.
Contributions comprise required amounts and discretionary contributions. Actual future contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan participants. Following amendments to the OPEB Plan in July2013, Consumers OPEB costs decreased substantially and, as a result, the OPEB Plan was fully funded at December31,2013. In May2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC requesting approval to suspend contributions to Consumers OPEB Plan during 2014 and 2015 if the OPEB Plan continued to be fully funded. Consumers electric and gas rates still reflect the higher OPEB costs, and previous MPSC orders required Consumers to contribute to the OPEB Plan the associated amount collected in rates annually.
In September2014, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement addressing Consumers OPEB Plan funding application. Under the settlement agreement, Consumers contributed $25million to the plan in 2014 and will contribute $29million in February2015. Consumers will then suspend further contributions until the MPSC determines funding requirements in future general rate cases.

The UWUA represents Consumers operating, maintenance, construction, and call center employees. The USW represents Zeeland employees.
Union contracts expire in 2015.
13: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CMSEnergy and Consumers provide a PISP to officers, employees, and non-employee directors based on their contributions to the successful management of the company. The PISP has a ten-year term, expiring in May2024.
All grants under the PISP for 2014 were in the form of performance-based, market-based, and time-lapse restricted stock. Prior to 2014, all grants were in the form of market-based and time-lapse restricted stock. Of the restricted stock awards granted to officers in 2014, 37.5percent were performance-based restricted stock, 37.5percent were market-based restricted stock, and 25percent were time-lapse restricted stock. In 2013 and 2012, the awards granted to officers were 75percent market-based restricted stock and 25percent time-lapse restricted stock. Award recipients receive shares of CMSEnergy common stock that have dividend and voting rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, however, the dividends on performance-based and market-based restricted stock are paid in restricted shares equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted shares are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying restricted stock shares.
Market-based restricted stock vesting is generally contingent on meeting a three-year service requirement and on a market condition. The market condition is based on a comparison of CMSEnergys total shareholder return with the median total shareholder return of a peer group over the same three-year period. Performance-based restricted stock vesting is contingent on meeting at least a 36-month service requirement and a performance condition. The performance condition is based on CMSEnergys EPS growth relative to a peer group over a three-year period. The awards granted in 2014 require a 38-month service period. Depending on the outcome of the market condition or the performance condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero to 200percent of the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock generally vests after a service period of threeyears.
140 Table of Contents All restricted stock awards vest fully upon death. Upon a change of control of CMSEnergy or termination under an officer separation agreement, restricted stock awards will vest in accordance with specific officer agreements. If stated in the award, for restricted stock recipients who terminate employment due to retirement or disability, a pro-rata portion of the award equal to the portion of the service period served between the award grant date and the employees termination date will vest upon termination, with any market-based award also contingent upon the outcome of the market condition and any performance-based award contingent upon the outcome of the performance condition. The remaining portion of the awards will be forfeited. Restricted shares are forfeited fully if employment terminates for any other reason or if the minimum service requirements are not met, as described in the award document.
The PISP also allows for restricted common stock units, unrestricted common stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, performance units, and incentive options, none of which was granted in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or performance units may not exceed 6.5million shares from June2014 through May2024, nor may such awards to any recipient exceed 500,000shares in any calendar year. CMSEnergy and Consumers may issue awards of up to 6,405,833shares of common stock under the PISP at December31,2014. Shares for which payment or exercise is in cash, as well as shares that expire, terminate, or are cancelled or forfeited, may be awarded or granted again under the PISP.

For performance-based awards, CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the number of shares expected to vest at the end of the performance period based on the probable achievement of the performance objective. Performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards have graded vesting features for retirement-eligible employees, and CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize expense for those awards on a graded vesting schedule over the required service period. Expense for performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards for non-retirement-eligible employees and time-lapse awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period.
141 Table of Contents The fair value of performance-based and time-lapse restricted stock is based on the price of CMSEnergys common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based restricted stock awards is calculated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMSEnergy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMSEnergy common stock. The risk-free rate for valuation of the market-based restricted stock awards was based on the three-year U.S.Treasury yield at the award grant date.
Presented in the following table are the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the market-based restricted stock awards: Years   Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 Expected   volatility 15.6 % 17.4 % 20.3 % Expected   dividend yield 3.7 3.9 4.1 Risk-free   rate 0.8 0.4 0.3 Presented in the following table is the weighted-average grant-date fair value of all awards under the PISP: Years   Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 CMSEnergy, including Consumers Weighted-average   grant-date fair value per share Restricted   stock granted $ 26.15 $ 16.65 $ 12.32 Consumers Weighted-average   grant-date fair value per share Restricted   stock granted $ 26.18 $ 16.76 $ 12.28 Presented in the following table are amounts related to all restricted stock awards: In Millions Years   Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 CMSEnergy, including Consumers Fair   value of shares that vested during the year $ 16 $ 10 $ 10 Compensation   expense recognized 14 14 12 Income   tax benefit recognized 5 5 5 Consumers Fair   value of shares that vested during the year $ 15 $ 9 $ 8 Compensation   expense recognized 13 14 11 Income   tax benefit recognized 5 5 4 At December31,2014, $13million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, and $13million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for Consumers. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 1.9years.
Since CMSEnergy has utilized tax loss carryforwards, CMSEnergy was unable to realize excess federal tax benefits upon vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, CMSEnergy did not recognize the related excess federal tax benefits in equity. Since CMSEnergy is not in a loss position for state tax purposes, CMSEnergy recognized the related state tax benefits of $1million in equity. As of December31,2014, CMSEnergy has $76million of unrealized excess federal tax benefits.
142 Table of Contents 14: INCOME TAXES CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and a unitary Michigan income tax return. Income taxes are allocated based on each companys separate taxable income in accordance with the CMSEnergy tax sharing agreement.
Presented in the following table is the difference between actual income tax expense on continuing operations, excluding noncontrolling interests, and income tax expense computed by applying the statutory U.S.federal income tax rate: In Millions, Except Tax Rate Years   Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 CMSEnergy, including Consumers Income   from continuing operations before income taxes $ 727 $ 754 $ 620 Income   tax expense at statutory rate 254 264 217 Increase (decrease) in income taxes from: State   and local income taxes, net of federal effect 36 37 27 Accelerated   flow-through of regulatory tax benefits (39 ) - - Other,   net (1 ) 1 1 Income   tax expense $ 250 $ 302 $ 245 Effective   tax rate 34.4 % 40.1 % 39.5 % Consumers Income   from continuing operations before income taxes $ 873 $ 880 $ 736 Income   tax expense at statutory rate 306 308 258 Increase (decrease) in income taxes from: State   and local income taxes, net of federal effect 42 43 36 Accelerated   flow-through of regulatory tax benefits (39 ) - - Other,   net (3 ) (5 ) 3 Income   tax expense $ 306 $ 346 $ 297 Effective   tax rate 35.1 % 39.3 % 40.4 % Prior to 2014, Consumers recognized the income tax benefits associated with the removal costs of plant placed in service before 1993 as payments were made and the tax benefits were flowed through to customers. In September2013, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to flow through to customers the income tax benefits on a straight-line basis over an accelerated period. This new regulatory treatment, which Consumers implemented in January2014, will accelerate the return of $209million of income tax benefits over fiveyears to electric customers and $260million of income tax benefits over 12years to gas customers. For the year ended December31,2014, this new treatment reduced Consumers income tax expense by $39million.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current according to the classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary differences.
145 Table of Contents Presented in the following table are the tax loss and credit carryforwards at December31,2014: In Millions GrossAmount TaxAttribute Expiration CMSEnergy, including   Consumers Federal net operating loss carryforward $ 1,032 $ 362 2025  2034 Local net operating loss carryforwards 406 4 2023  2034 State capital loss carryforward 18 1 2014 Alternative minimum tax credits 270 270 No expiration Charitable contribution carryover 1 1 2016  2019 General business credits 38 38 2018  2034 Total tax attributes $ 676 Consumers Federal net operating loss carryforward $ 125 $ 44 2025  2034 State capital loss carryforward 10 1 2014 Charitable contribution carryover 1 - 2016  2019 Total tax attributes $ 45 CMSEnergy has provided a valuation allowance of $1million for the local tax loss carryforward, and a valuation allowance of $1million for the state capital loss carryforward. Consumers has provided a valuation allowance of $1million for the state capital loss carryforward. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to utilize fully tax loss and credit carryforwards for which no valuation has been provided. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments will be made to the valuation allowances within one year.
Presented in the following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax benefits: In Millions Years Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 CMSEnergy, including   Consumers Balance at beginning of period $ 4 $ 1 $ 4 Additions for current-year tax positions 2 - - Additions for prior-year tax positions 1 3 1 Reductions for prior-year tax positions (2 ) - (4 ) Balance at end of period $ 5 $ 4 $ 1 Consumers Balance at beginning of period $ 4 $ 1 $ 4 Additions for current-year tax positions 2 - - Additions for prior-year tax positions 1 3 1 Reductions for prior-year tax positions (2 ) - (4 ) Balance at end of period $ 5 $ 4 $ 1 If recognized, all of these uncertain tax benefits would affect CMSEnergys and Consumers annual effective tax rates in future years.
CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and penalties, where applicable, as part of income tax expense. CMSEnergy, including Consumers, recognized no interest or penalties for the years ended December31,2014, 2013, or 2012.
In April2014, the IRS completed its audit of the federal income tax returns of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries for 2010 and 2011. The audit resulted in no significant adjustments to CMSEnergys or Consumers taxable income or income tax expense.
146 Table of Contents CMSEnergys federal income tax returns for 2012 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. CMSEnergys MCIT and MBT returns for 2008 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the State of Michigan.
The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. CMSEnergys and Consumers estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that their accrued tax liabilities at December31,2014 were adequate for all years.

For the periods those securities were outstanding, they diluted EPS to the extent that the conversion value of the securities, which was based on the average market price of CMSEnergy common stock, exceeded their principal value. For additional details regarding the contingently convertible securities, see Note5, Financings and Capitalization.
N ON-VESTED S TOCK A WARDS CMSEnergys non-vested stock awards are composed of participating and non-participating securities. The participating securities accrue cash dividends when common stockholders receive dividends. Since the recipient is not required to return the dividends to CMSEnergy if the recipient forfeits the award, the non-vested stock awards are considered participating securities. As such, the participating non-vested stock awards were included in the computation of basic EPS. The non-participating securities accrue stock dividends that vest concurrently with the stock award. If the recipient forfeits the award, the stock dividends accrued on the non-participating securities are also forfeited. Accordingly, the non-participating awards and stock dividends were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but not basic EPS.

CMS Energy and Consumers evaluate the performance of each segment based on its contribution to net income available to CMS Energys common stockholders.
Accounting policies for CMS Energys and Consumers segments are as described in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the individual segments when appropriate. Accounts are allocated among the segments when common accounts are attributable to more than one segment. The allocations are based on certain measures of business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers, other operation and maintenance expense, construction expense, leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For example, customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.
Inter-segment sales and transfers are accounted for at current market prices and are eliminated in consolidated net income available to common stockholders by segment.
CMS E NERGY The reportable segments for CMS Energy are:  electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan;  gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in Michigan; and  enterprises, consisting of various subsidiaries engaging primarily in domestic independent power production.
CMS Energy presents EnerBank, corporate interest and other expenses, and discontinued operations within other reconciling items.
C ONSUMERS The reportable segments for Consumers are:  electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan; and  gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in Michigan.

152 Table of Contents 18: RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS  CONSUMERS Consumers enters into a number of significant transactions with related parties. These transactions include:  purchase of electricity from affiliates of CMSEnterprises;  payment of parent company overhead costs to CMSEnergy; and  investment in CMSEnergy common stock.
Transactions involving power supply purchases from certain affiliates of CMSEnterprises are based on avoided costs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, state law, and competitive bidding. The payment of parent company overhead costs is based on the use of accepted industry allocation methodologies. These payments are for costs that occur in the normal course of business.
Presented in the following table is Consumers expense recorded from related party transactions for the years ended December 31: In   Millions Description Related   Party 2014 2013 2012 Purchases   of capacity and energy Affiliates   of CMSEnterprises $89 $89 $86 Amounts payable to related parties for purchased power and other services were $12 million at December 31, 2014 and $13 million at December 31, 2013.
Consumers owned 1.1 million shares of CMS Energy common stock with a fair value of $38 million at December 31, 2014. For additional details on Consumers investment in CMS Energy common stock, see Note 7, Financial Instruments.
In September 2014, Consumers entered into three transactions with CMS ERM for the purchase of capacity for future years. The purchases, which were the result of competitive bidding, total $3 million.
In November 2014, Consumers renewed a short-term credit agreement with CMS Energy, permitting Consumers to borrow up to $300 million. At December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding loans under the agreement.
153 Table of Contents 19: VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CMSEnergy has variable interests in T.E.S.Filer City, Grayling, and Genesee. CMSEnergy is not the primary beneficiary of any of these partnerships because power is shared among unrelated parties, and no one party has the power to direct activities, such as operations and maintenance, plant dispatch, and fuel strategy, that most significantly impact the entities economic performance. The partners must agree on all major decisions for each of the partnerships.
Presented in the following table is information about these partnerships: Name (Ownership Interest) Nature   of the Entity Financing   of Partnership T.E.S. Filer City (50%) Coal-fueled   power generator Non-recourse   long-term debt that matured in December2007.
Grayling (50%) Wood   waste-fueled power generator Sale   of revenue bonds that were retired in March2012.
Genesee (50%) Wood   waste-fueled power generator Sale   of revenue bonds that mature in 2021 and bear interest at fixed rates. The   debt is non-recourse to the partners and secured by a CMSEnergy   guarantee capped at $3 million annually.
CMSEnergy has operating and management contracts with Grayling and Genesee, and Consumers is the primary purchaser of power from each partnership through long-term PPAs. Consumers also has reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee, which allow these facilities to be dispatched based on the market price of wood waste. This results in fuel cost savings that each partnership shares with Consumers customers.
CMS Energys investment in these partnerships is included in investments on its consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $57 million as of December 31, 2014 and $56 million as of December 31, 2013. The creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the general credit of CMS Energy or Consumers, except through a guarantee provided by CMS Energy of $3 million annually. CMS Energy has deferred collections on certain receivables owed by Genesee. CMS Energys maximum exposure to loss from these receivables is $8 million. Consumers has not provided any financial or other support during the periods presented that was not previously contractually required.
20: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CMS Energys income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 consisted of an $11 million ($7 million net of income tax) reversal of a loss on disposal due to the elimination of a liability associated with the 2003 sale of Panhandle. There was no income or loss from discontinued operations in 2013 or 2014.

The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2014 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A.

ITEM9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES CMS E NERGY Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMSEnergy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMSEnergys CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31,2014.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: CMSEnergys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f). CMSEnergys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of CMSEnergy;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMSEnergy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of CMSEnergy; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of CMSEnergys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMSEnergy conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2014. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMSEnergys management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,2014. The effectiveness of CMSEnergys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item8.
