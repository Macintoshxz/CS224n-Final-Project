11 Table of Contents PARTI ITEM1. BUSINESS GENERAL CMSE NERGY CMSEnergy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and biomass.
CMSEnergy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides and operates, principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers consolidated operations account for substantially all of CMSEnergys total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMSEnergys consolidated operating revenue was $6.5billion in 2011, $6.4billion in 2010, and $6.2billion in 2009.
For further information about operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to all of CMSEnergys business segments and operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, CMSEnergys Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
C ONSUMERS Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric distribution and generation facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.7million of Michigans 10million residents. Consumers rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as described in CMSEnergy and Consumers Regulation in this Item1.
Consumers consolidated operating revenue was $6.3billion in 2011, $6.2billion in 2010, and $6.0billion in 2009. For further information about operating revenue, net operating income, and identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers electric and gas utility operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consumers Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consumers owns its principal properties in fee, except that most electric lines and gas mains are located below public roads or on land owned by others and are accessed by Consumers through easements and other rights. Almost all of Consumers properties are subject to the lien of its First Mortgage Bond Indenture. For additional information on Consumers properties, see Consumers Electric Utility  Electric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas Utility  Gas Utility Properties in the Business Segments section of this Item1.
12 Table of Contents In2011, Consumers served 1.8 million electric customers and 1.7million gas customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map is Consumers service territory: 13 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENTS C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY Electric Utility Operations: Consumers electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $3.9billion in 2011, $3.8billion in 2010, and $3.4billion in 2009. Consumers electric utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2011 electric utility operating revenue of $3.9billion by customer class: Consumers electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
In each of 2011 and 2010, Consumers electric deliveries were 38billionkWh, which included ROA deliveries of fourbillionkWh. Net bundled sales were 34billionkWh in each of 2011 and 2010.
Consumers electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.
14 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2011 and 2010: Consumers 2011 summer peak demand was 8,930MW, which included ROA demand of 624MW. For the 2010-2011 winter period, Consumers peak demand was 6,201MW, which included ROA demand of 489MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term contracts, capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2012.
Electric Utility Properties: Consumers distribution system includes:  413 miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120kilovolts or above;  4,244 miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 23kilovolts and 46kilovolts;  17 miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 23kilovolts and 46kilovolts;  55,953 miles of electric distribution overhead lines;  10,112 miles of underground distribution lines; and  substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 24millionkVA.
Consumers is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by METC and operated by MISO, to neighboring utilities, and to other transmission systems.

3 Includes purchases from the Midwest Energy Market and seasonal purchases.
The cost of all fuels consumed, shown in the following table, fluctuates with the mix of fuel used.
Cost Per Million Btu Fuel Consumed 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Coal $ 2.94 $ 2.51 $ 2.37 $ 2.01 $ 2.04 Gas 4.95 5.57 6.57 10.94 10.29 Oil 18.55 10.98 9.59 11.54 8.21 Nuclear     0.42 All fuels 1 $ 3.18 $ 2.71 $ 2.56 $ 2.47 $ 2.07 1 Weighted-average fuel costs In 2011, Consumers four coal-fueled generating sites burned 9million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 15,468GWh of electricity, which represented 42percent of the energy provided by Consumers to meet customer demand.
In order to obtain its coal requirements, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December31,2011, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2014; these contracts total $261million. All of Consumers coal supply contracts have fixed prices. At December31,2011, Consumers had 86percent of its 2012 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 41-day supply of coal on hand.
In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has long-term transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers generating facilities. Consumers coal transportation contracts expire from 2012 through 2014; these contracts total $427million.
18 Table of Contents During 2011, Consumers purchased 53percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs, seasonal purchases, and the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers offers its generation into the Midwest Energy Market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the Midwest Energy Market to meet its customers needs during peak demand periods.
At December31,2011, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which liabilities, in accordance with GAAP, have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants availability or deliverability. The payments for 2012 through 2040 total $15.3billion and range from $901million to $1.1billion annually for each of the next five years. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Capital Resources and Liquidity.
Electric Utility Competition : Consumers electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.
The Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers electric customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008Energy Law revised the Customer Choice Act by limiting alternative electric supply to tenpercent of weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December31,2011, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the tenpercent limit. Alternative electric suppliers were providing 785MW of generation service to ROA customers.
Consumers also has competition or potential competition from:  industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside Consumers service territory for economic reasons;  municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and  customer self-generation.
Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent areas and monitoring compliance with the MPSCs and FERCs rules, providing non-energy services, adding value to customers through Consumers rates and service, and providing tariff-based incentives that support economic development.
C ONSUMERS G AS U TILITY Gas Utility Operations: Consumers gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $2.3billion in 2011, $2.4billion in 2010, and $2.6billion in 2009. Consumers gas utility customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
19 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2011 gas utility operating revenue of $2.3billion by customer class: Consumers gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
20 Table of Contents In 2011, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 337bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 48bcf. In 2010, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 317bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 36bcf. Consumers gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2011, 46percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage. Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2011 and 2010: Gas Utility Properties: Consumers gas distribution and transmission system located in Michigans Lower Peninsula consists of:  26,623 miles of distribution mains;  1,666 miles of transmission lines;  seven compressor stations with a total of 150,635 installed and available horsepower; and  15 gas storage fields with an aggregate storage capacity of 307bcf and a working storage capacity of 142bcf.
21 Table of Contents Gas Utility Supply: In 2011, Consumers purchased 70percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and 10percent from Canadian producers. The remaining 20percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2011: Firm transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission,L.P., Panhandle, Trunkline Gas Company, LLC, and Vector PipelineL.P. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2017 and provide for the delivery of 65percent of Consumers total gas supply requirements. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.
Gas Utility Competition: Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers gas utility business. Competition comes from other gas suppliers taking advantage of direct access to Consumers customers (GCC) and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.
E NTERPRISES S EGMENT N ON -U TILITY O PERATIONS AND I NVESTMENTS CMSEnergys enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production and the marketing of independent power production. The enterprises segments operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMSEnergys consolidated financial statements was $204million in 2011, $238million in 2010, and $216million in 2009. The enterprises segments operating revenue included in income (loss) from discontinued operations in CMSEnergys consolidated financial statements was less than $1 million in 2011, $10million in 2010, and $7million in 2009.
22 Table of Contents Independent Power Production : At December31,2011, CMSEnergy had ownership interests in independent power plants totaling 1,135 grossMW or 1,034 netMW. (Net MW reflects that portion of the gross capacity relating to CMSEnergys ownership interests.) Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys interests in independent power plants at December31,2011: Location Primary Fuel Type OwnershipInterest (%) GrossCapacity (MW) Gross Capacity UnderLong-Term Contract (%) Dearborn, Michigan Natural gas 100 710 20 Gaylord, Michigan Naturalgas 100 156 59 Comstock, Michigan Natural gas 100 68 59 Filer City, Michigan Coal 50 73 100 Flint, Michigan Biomass 50 40 100 Grayling, Michigan Biomass 50 38 100 New Bern, North Carolina Biomass 50 50 100 Total 1,135 The operating revenue from independent power production included in income from continuing operations in CMSEnergys consolidated financial statements was $17million in 2011 and $18million in each of 2010 and 2009. The operating revenue from independent power production included in income (loss) from discontinued operations in CMSEnergys consolidated financial statements was less than $1million in 2011, $10million in 2010, and $7million in 2009. CMSEnergys independent power production business faces competition from generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.
Energy Resource Management : CMSERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMSEnergys generating facilities and continues to focus on optimizing CMSEnergys independent power production portfolio. In 2011, CMSERM marketed 17bcf of natural gas and 2,417GWh of electricity. All marketed electricity was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment. CMSERMs operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMSEnergys consolidated financial statements was $187million in 2011, $220million in 2010, and $198million in 2009.
O THER B USINESSES EnerBank: EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMSEnergy, is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBanks operating revenue included in income from continuing operations in CMSEnergys consolidated financial statements was $46million in 2011, $38million in 2010, and $26million in 2009.
CMSENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including those described in the following sections.
FERC FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMSEnterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMSERM, CMSGas Transmission, and DIG. Among other things, FERC has jurisdiction over acquisitions, operations, and disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates charged, conduct among affiliates, and limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMSEnergy. FERC, in connection with NERC and with regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation owners and operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system. Certain aspects of Consumers gas business are also subject to regulation by FERC.
23 Table of Contents FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.
MPSC Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, corporate mergers, and other matters.
The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, and others often appeal significant MPSC orders.
Rate Proceedings: For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note6, Regulatory Matters.
O THER R EGULATION The U.S.Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the DOEs Office of Fossil Fuels.
The U.S.Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.
EnerBank is regulated by the State of Utah and the FDIC.
E NERGY L EGISLATION CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven matters, including Michigans 2008Energy Law. This law requires that at least tenpercent of Consumers electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and includes requirements for specific capacity additions. The 2008Energy Law also requires Consumers to prepare an energy optimization plan and achieve annual sales reduction targets through at least 2015. The targets are incremental with the goal of achieving a sixpercent reduction in customers electricity use and a fourpercent reduction in customers natural gas use by December31,2015. The 2008Energy Law also reformed the Customer Choice Act to limit alternative energy suppliers to supplying no more than tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted sales. For additional information regarding Consumers renewable energy and energy optimization plans and the Customer Choice Act, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties.
CMSENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality, including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item1A. Risk Factors and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note5, Contingencies and Commitments.
CMSEnergy has recorded a significant liability for its affiliates obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a significant liability for its obligations at a number of MGP sites. For additional information, see Item1A. Risk Factors and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note5, Contingencies and Commitments.
Air: Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants and to convert electric generating units to burn cleaner fuels. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $1.2billion from 2012 through 2018 to comply with present and future federal and state regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers estimate may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented regarding greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide.
24 Table of Contents Solid Waste Disposal: Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Historically, Consumers has worked with others to reuse 30to 40percent of ash produced by its coal-fueled plants, and sells ash for use as a Portland cement replacement in concrete products, as feedstock for the manufacture of Portland cement, and for other environmentally-compatible uses. Consumers solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigans solid waste rules. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems, which reduce landfill venting substantially. All of Consumers ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. The EPA has proposed new federal regulations for ash disposal areas. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $150million from 2012 through 2018 to comply with future regulations relating to ash disposal, assuming ash is regulated as a non-hazardous solid waste.
Water: Consumers uses significant amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA is developing new regulations related to cooling water intake systems, but these new regulations are not expected to take effect until after 2018. Accordingly, Consumers does not presently expect to incur any significant expenditures to comply with future regulations relating to cooling water intake systems through 2018. Significant expenditures could be required beyond 2018, but until a rule is final any potential expenditures are difficult to predict. Consumers also expects the EPA to propose new federal regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in July2012, with a final rule in 2014. Consumers preliminary estimate of expenditures to comply with these expected regulations is $150million from 2012 through 2018.
For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, MD&A, Outlook, Consumers Electric Utility Business Outlook and Uncertainties  Electric Environmental Estimates.
INSURANCE CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMSEnergy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMSEnergy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMSEnergy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.
CMSEnergys and Consumers present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental cleanup costs and environmental damages, such as claims for air pollution, damage to sites owned by CMSEnergy or Consumers, and some long-term storage or disposal of wastes.

28 Table of Contents ITEM1A. RISK FACTORS Actual results in future periods for CMSEnergy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections. CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the companies management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMSEnergy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMSEnergy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant.
CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.
Due to its holding company structure, CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMSEnergy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation, and by FERC requirements. At December31,2011, under its articles of incorporation, Consumers had $493million of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock dividends. If sufficient dividends are not paid to CMSEnergy by its subsidiaries, CMSEnergy may not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity and financial condition.
CMSEnergy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and hence its ability to meet its debt service obligations.
At December31,2011, CMSEnergy, including Consumers, had $7.1billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including $29million of subordinated indebtedness relating to its convertible preferred securities. CMSEnergy had $2.3billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness at December31,2011. At December31,2011, there were no borrowings and $3million of letters of credit outstanding under CMSEnergys revolving credit agreement. CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future.
The level of CMSEnergys present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others:  a significant portion of CMSEnergys cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes;  covenants contained in CMSEnergys existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business;  CMSEnergys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited;  CMSEnergy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged;  CMSEnergys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase; and  CMSEnergys future credit ratings could fluctuate.
CMSEnergys ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions (including with respect to environmental matters), and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMSEnergy cannot make assurances that its business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMSEnergy is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it may be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing. CMSEnergy cannot ensure that additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.
29 Table of Contents CMSEnergy cannot predict the outcome of regulatory reviews and claims regarding its environmental remediation obligation at Bay Harbor.
CMSEnergy has participated in discussions with the EPA and the MDEQ relating to proposals by CMSLand and CMSCapital to remedy the flow of leachate from buried CKD piles at the Bay Harbor site to Lake Michigan and related environmental issues. CMSEnergy has reached a tentative agreement with the MDEQ that identifies the final remedies at the site. The parties are awaiting EPA review prior to finalizing the agreement. In December2010, the MDEQ issued a five-year NPDES permit that authorizes CMSLand to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay. Discharge of treated leachate at the site has commenced. Costs to treat and discharge collected leachate under this permit could exceed present expectations. Additionally, CMSLand and CMSCapital could be required to alter their present water disposal strategy upon expiration of this permit if the MDEQ or EPA identify a more suitable option, or if the permit itself is challenged before the MDEQ or the courts. CMSLand and CMSCapital, the MDEQ, the EPA, and other parties continue to negotiate the long-term remedy for the Bay Harbor site. These negotiations are focused on, among other things, issues related to:  the disposal of leachate;  the location and design of collection lines and upstream water diversion systems;  application of criteria for various substances such as mercury; and  other matters that are likely to affect the scope of remedial work that CMSLand and CMSCapital may be obligated to undertake.
Depending on the results of these negotiations, as well as the size of any indemnity obligation or liability under an Administrative Order on Consent signed by CMSLand and CMSCapital or other liability under environmental laws, adverse outcomes of some or all of these matters could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity and financial condition and could negatively affect CMSEnergys financial results.
CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to incur additional significant costs related to remediation of former MGP sites.
Consumers is presently monitoring or remediating 23 former MGP sites. Consumers is working collaboratively with the MDEQ to agree upon executable remediation plans. About one-third of the 23 sites have been remediated to the extent possible and are now being monitored. The remaining sites are being actively remediated through excavation, treatment at the site, containment, and/or natural reduction; two of these sites require complex remediation plans due to the involvement of surface water.
The MDEQ established a No Further Action status for these sites in late 2010 and is presently overhauling the implementation of the 2010 statutory revisions with a focus on streamlining the process, reasonable and consistent implementation, and risk-based techniques.
CMS Energy and Consumers expect to incur additional significant costs related to the remediation of these former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to be able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.
CMSEnergy could be affected adversely by a regulatory investigation and civil lawsuits regarding pricing information that CMSMST and CMSField Services provided to market publications.
In 2002, CMSEnergy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agencies that some employees at CMSMST and CMSField Services appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which compile and report index prices. CMSEnergy has cooperated with the DOJs investigation regarding this matter. CMSEnergy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation or the amount of any fines or penalties that may be imposed and what effect, if any, the investigation will have on CMSEnergy.
CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas,Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged false natural gas price reporting.
30 Table of Contents Allegations included manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMSEnergy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMSEnergy may be liable. It is possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers retain contingent liabilities in connection with their asset sales.
The agreements that CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:  retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions;  indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties they make; and  make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions.
Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers may ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
In January2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $142 million in taxes, plus interest, in connection with the sale. CMSEnergy has concluded that the governments tax claim is without merit. The government of Equatorial Guinea indicated through a request for arbitration in October2011 that it still intends to pursue its claim. CMSEnergy is vigorously contesting the claim, and cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. It is possible that the outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets. Potential disruption in the capital and credit markets could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements and their ability to meet long-term commitments. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other contingent liabilities. Consumers capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it implements renewable power generation and environmental projects, and those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented.
CMSEnergy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from Consumers operations and, in the case of CMS Energy, dividends from Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments.
Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect CMSEnergys and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their respective businesses, as could Consumers inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act. Any disruption or inability to obtain FERC authorization could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative 31 Table of Contents credit arrangements or other funding for their business needs can be arranged. These measures could include deferring capital expenditures, changing CMSEnergys and Consumers commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.
CMSEnergy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial plan. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new capital markets debt, preferred stock and/or common equity, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers plans to seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMSEnergys and Consumers securities issuances in particular. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies. If CMSEnergy or Consumers is unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or is unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, there could be a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Certain of CMSEnergys securities and those of its affiliates, including Consumers, are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could make its cost of borrowing higher, and could cause CMSEnergy or Consumers to reduce its capital expenditures. If it is unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMSEnergy or Consumers may have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain of its suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMSEnergy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMSEnergys credit ratings. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could incur significant costs to comply with environmental requirements.
CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. They believe that environmental laws and regulations related to their operations will continue to become more stringent and require them to make additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment installation and upgrades.
In August2011, the EPA finalized and promulgated CSAPR as a replacement for CAIR. CSAPR was scheduled to take effect on January1,2012, and CMSEnergy and Consumers were prepared to comply. In December2011, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit issued a stay of CSAPR, and CAIR remains in effect.
In December2011, the EPA issued the maximum achievable control technology standard for electric generating units, also known as the EGU MACT. This final rule, which the EPA has renamed MATS, is expected to have a significant impact on Consumers coal-fueled generating fleet.
In 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding for greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In this finding, which has been challenged in the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit by numerous parties, the EPA determined that present and projected atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of present and future generations. In May2010, the EPA issued a final rule that addresses greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act permitting programs. The tailoring rule sets thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions that define when permits under the NSR and TitleV programs are required for new and existing industrial facilities. This regulation took effect in January2011. Comprehensive federal legislation that addresses greenhouse gases has not advanced in the U.S.Congress. Federal legislation is considered likely to be enacted in some form in the future and could have a significant impact on the operation and cost of existing and future fossil-fueled power plants.
In 2011, 98 percent of the energy generated by Consumers came from fossil-fueled power plants, with 87 percent coming from coal-fueled power plants. The emissions from fossil-fueled power plants are presently subject to greenhouse gas regulations. CMSEnterprises also has interests in fossil-fueled power plants and other 32 Table of Contents types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. Federal laws and rules limiting the emission of greenhouse gases or similar state laws and rules, if enacted, as well as international accords and treaties, could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in non-fossil-fuel generating capacity, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases.
The following risks related to climate change and emissions could also have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations:  litigation originated by third parties against CMSEnergy, Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to CMSEnergys or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions;  impairment of CMSEnergys or Consumers reputation due to its greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of its response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation;and  extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assets.
The EPA is considering regulating CCBs, such as coal ash, as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Michigan already regulates CCBs as low-hazard industrial waste. If coal ash is regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers would likely cease the beneficial re-use of this product, resulting in significantly more coal ash requiring costly disposal. Additionally, it is possible that existing landfills could be closed if the upgrades to hazardous waste landfill standards are economically prohibitive. Costs associated with this potential regulation could be substantial.
The EPA is revising regulations that govern cooling water intake structures aimed at protecting aquatic life and that govern water discharges. Costs associated with these revisions could be material to CMSEnergy, Consumers, and CMSEnterprises and result in operational changes or possibly significant impacts on the economics of generating units.
CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to collect fully from their customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMSEnergys and/or Consumers liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and CMSEnergy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.
A delay or failure by CMSEnergy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could:  prevent the construction of new facilities;  prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities;  prevent the modification of existing facilities; or  result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require significant funding.
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMSEnergys and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMSEnergy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets 33 Table of Contents are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below CMSEnergys and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels may significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Periodic reviews of the values of CMSEnergys and Consumers assets could result in impairment charges.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are required by GAAP to review periodically the carrying value of their assets, including those that may be sold. Market conditions, the operational characteristics of their assets, and other factors could result in recording impairment charges for their assets, which could have an adverse effect on their stockholders equity and their access to additional financing. In addition, CMSEnergy and Consumers may be required to record impairment charges at the time they sell assets, depending on the sale prices they are able to secure and other factors.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.
In the regular course of business, CMSEnergy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMSEnergys and Consumers information systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. Such events could disrupt operations, subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to possible financial liability, diminish their reputation and the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, CMSEnergys and Consumers technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, and unauthorized access. Those failures or breaches could impact the reliability of electric and gas generation and delivery and also subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to financial harm. If CMSEnergys and Consumers technology systems were to fail or be breached, CMSEnergy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, or the inability of CMSEnergy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses have safety risks.
Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure, and energy products could be involved in accidents that result in injury or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMSEnergy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident or accident, CMSEnergy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, damage to its reputation, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.
34 Table of Contents CMSEnergys and Consumers revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions, or other catastrophic events.
The impact of natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, cyber intrusions, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMSEnergy and Consumers could have a material adverse affect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. A terrorist attack on physical infrastructure or a major natural disaster could result in severe damage to CMSEnergys and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the electric and gas distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. Terrorist attacks or acts of war could result in the disruption of power and fuel markets that could increase costs or disrupt service. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, credit crises, recessions, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.
Consumers is actively engaged in multiple regulatory oversight processes and has a large electric and gas customer base. As a result, Consumers has a highly visible public profile in Michigan. Consumers and CMSEnergy could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate compliance policies, regulatory violations, or other events. This could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.
Energy risk management strategies may not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMSEnergy and Consumers or increased volatility of their earnings.
Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and RECs. Prices for natural gas, coal, electricity, emission allowances, and RECs may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to commodity price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its plants consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. Consumers manages these risks using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets.
Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in greater unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related 35 Table of Contents to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves at CMSEnergy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Increases in local, state, or federal tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.
Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. Although Consumers believes that economic conditions in Michigan are improving, the economy in Consumers service territories continues to be affected adversely by the recession and its impact on the states automotive and real estate sectors and by relatively high unemployment. The Michigan economy also has been affected negatively by the uncertainty in the financial and credit markets. If economic conditions in Michigan decline further, Consumers may experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses are seasonal. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer cooling season and the winter heating season. Demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. Accordingly, their overall results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season could have a material adverse affect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.
Unforeseen maintenance of our power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, or other acts of God, equipment failure, operator error, or to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers costs of generation. If Consumers were unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.
Over 40percent of Consumers employees are represented by a union. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or if the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs.
Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations.
The workforce of CMSEnergy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could affect CMSEnergys and 36 Table of Contents Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations could be affected negatively.
Consumers may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal or natural gas, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.
Consumers is dependent on coal for a significant portion of its electric generating capacity. While Consumers has coal supply and transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to Consumers. The suppliers under the agreements may experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing or future coal supply and transportation contracts, it might be required to purchase coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher cost generating resources in the Midwest Energy Market, which would increase Consumers working capital requirements.
Consumers has firm interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate deliveries of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterpartys failure to perform, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these firm interstate transportation and supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas to Consumers. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to deliver natural gas to Consumers in certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC, which would increase Consumers working capital requirements and decrease its natural gas revenues.
Electric industry regulation could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
Federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed dramatically in the last two decades and could continue to change over the next several years. These changes could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive federal and state utility regulation. In CMSEnergys and Consumers business planning and management of operations, they must address the effects of existing and proposed regulation on their businesses and changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, regional transmission organizations, utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Adoption of new regulations by federal or state agencies, or changes to present regulations and interpretations of these regulations, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
There are multiple proceedings pending before FERC involving transmission matters. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these electric industry restructuring proceedings on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Electric industry legislation in Michigan, coupled with increased competition in gas and electric markets, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
The 2008 Energy Law, among other things, limits alternative electric supply to tenpercent of weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are placing increasing competitive pressure on Consumers electric supply. Presently, the ROA level on Consumers system is at the ten-percent cap and there is a backlog. Proposals have been made to raise the ROA limit above tenpercent, which, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on Consumers business. Proposals also have been made to increase the 37 Table of Contents electric sales volume that will be required from renewable energy sources, including a proposal that would amend the Michigan Constitution to increase the electric sales volume required from renewable energy sources to 25 percent by 2025. Other new legislation or interpretations could change how the businesses of CMSEnergy and Consumers operate, impact Consumers ability to recover costs through rate increases, or require CMSEnergy and Consumers to incur additional expenses.
The markets for alternative energy and distributed generation could impact financial results.
Advances in technology could reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills, and photovoltaic (solar) cells, to a level that is competitive with that of fossil-fuel technology utilized by CMSEnergy and Consumers to produce a majority of their electricity. It is also possible that electric customers could reduce their electric consumption significantly through demand-side energy conservation programs. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy electricity. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Electric and gas rates for their utilities are set by the MPSC and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. While Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Law to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, subject to certain limitations, if a final rate order from the MPSC provides for lower rates than Consumers self-implemented, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. Also, the MPSC may delay or deny implementation of a rate increase upon showing of good cause. In February 2011, the MPSC found good cause to delay Consumers self-implementation of its requested gas rate increase.
In addition, Consumers plans for making significant capital investments, including modifications to meet new environmental requirements and investment in new generation, could be affected adversely or could have a material adverse effect on Consumers if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of modifications to meet environmental requirements and other prudent investments. In addition, because certain costs are mandated by state requirements for cost recovery, such as resource additions to meet Michigans renewable resource standard, regulators could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other required items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including failure of Michigans economy to improve sufficiently or diminishment of Consumers customer base. In addition to potentially affecting Consumers investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility properties, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy efficiency investments and state or federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Grid program costs, or expenditures subjected to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters including, but not limited to, prevention or curtailment of shutoffs for non-paying customers, Consumers electric and gas revenue decoupling mechanisms, prevention or curtailment of rights to self-implement rate requests, refunds of previously self-implemented rates, or the allocation of the DOE settlement amount.
FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMSEnergy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of CMSEnergy and Consumers to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
38 Table of Contents The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, could have a substantial negative effect on the companies investment plans and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers financial statements, including their reported earnings, could be significantly impacted by convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to make broad changes to GAAP as part of an overall initiative to converge U.S. standards with International Financial Reporting Standards. These changes could have significant impacts on the financial statements of CMSEnergy and Consumers. Also, the SEC is considering incorporating International Financial Reporting Standards into the financial reporting system for U.S. registrants. A transition to International Financial Reporting Standards could significantly impact CMSEnergys and Consumers financial results, since these standards differ from GAAP in many ways. One of the major differences is the lack of special accounting treatment for regulated activities under International Financial Reporting Standards, which could result in greater earnings volatility for CMSEnergy and Consumers.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of those with whom they do business.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to credit risk of counterparties with whom they do business. Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by these counterparties could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMSEnergys and Consumers services or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMSEnergy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform services timely. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
In recent years, the capital and credit markets have experienced unprecedented high levels of volatility and disruption. Market disruption and volatility could have a negative impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers lenders, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMSEnergys banking subsidiary, EnerBank.
EnerBank must comply with governmental laws and regulations that are subject to change and may involve material costs or affect how EnerBank operates.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is a sweeping piece of legislation, and the financial services industry is still assessing the impacts. Congress detailed some significant changes, but the Dodd-Frank Act leaves many details to be determined by regulation and further study. The full impact will not be fully known for months or even years, as regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are adopted by the appropriate agencies, and as the text of the Dodd-Frank Act is analyzed by impacted stakeholders and possibly the courts. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is part of the Federal Reserve and has been granted significant rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. The direction that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection will take, the regulations it will adopt, and its interpretation of existing laws and regulations are not yet known.
Also, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Government Accountability Office published a study of the various exemptions in the Bank Holding Company Act for certain types of depository institutions, including industrial banks such as EnerBank. CMSEnergy is not regulated as a bank holding company as a result of such an exemption. It is too early to determine what impact, if any, this study will have on the continued availability of this exemption.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The Volcker Rule becomes effective in July 2012. The implementing regulations for the Volcker Rule were issued in draft 39 Table of Contents form by various regulatory agencies in October 2011. Under the proposed regulations, CMSEnergy (and its affiliates) may be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third party hedge or private equity funds, or sponsoring these funds unless CMSEnergy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMSEnergy cannot presently predict the full impact of the Volcker Rule on CMSEnergys or EnerBanks operations or financial condition.
Furthermore, effective July 2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMSEnergy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMSEnergy is contractually required (i)to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii)to provide EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank presently meets or exceeds all of these requirements.
CMSEnergy could be required to pay cash to certain security holders in connection with the optional conversion of their convertible securities.
CMSEnergy has issued two series of cash-convertible securities, of which an aggregate principal amount of $398million was outstanding at December31,2011. If the trading price of CMSEnergys common stock exceeds specified amounts at the end of a particular fiscal quarter, then holders of one or both series of these convertible securities will have the option to convert their securities in the following fiscal quarter, with the principal amount payable in cash by CMSEnergy. Accordingly, if these trading price minimums are satisfied and security holders exercise their conversion rights, CMSEnergy may be required to outlay a significant amount of cash to those security holders, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity and financial condition.
There are risks associated with Consumers significant capital investment program planned for the next five years.
Consumers planned investments include the Smart Grid program, renewable power generation, gas compression, environmental controls, and other electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, effective cost and schedule management during implementation, changes in commodity and other prices, operational performance, changes in environmental, legislative and regulatory requirements, and regulatory cost recovery. Consumers cannot predict the impact that any of these factors could have on the success of its capital investment program. It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

47 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS This MD&A is a combined report of CMSEnergy and Consumers.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW CMSEnergy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, owns and operates power generation facilities.
CMSEnergy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMSEnergy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility investments and operations. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility.
CMSEnergy and Consumers earn revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services; electric distribution and generation; gas transmission, storage, and distribution; and other energy-related services. Their businesses are affected primarily by:  regulation and regulatory matters;  economic conditions;  weather;  energy commodity prices;  interest rates; and  CMSEnergys and Consumers securities credit ratings.
CMSEnergys business strategy has emphasized the key elements depicted below: 48 Table of Contents S AFE , E XCELLENT O PERATIONS The safety and security of employees, customers, and the general public remain a priority of CMSEnergy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMSEnergy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. From 2007 to 2011, Consumers achieved a 73percent reduction in the annual number of recordable safety incidents.
C USTOMER V ALUE Consumers is undertaking a number of initiatives that reflect its intensified customer focus. Consumers planned investments in reliability are aimed at improving safety, reducing customer outage frequency, reducing repetitive outages, and increasing customer satisfaction. Consumers productivity and efficiency improvements are expected to help keep annual base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the average rate of inflation. Consumers considers these and other aspects of its customer value initiative to be important to its success.
U TILITY I NVESTMENT Consumers expects to make capital investments of $6.6billion from 2012 through 2016, as presented in the following illustration: Consumers has limited its capital investment program to those investments it believes are needed to provide safe, reliable, and efficient service to its customers. Consumers capital investment program is expected to result in annual rate base growth of five to sevenpercent while allowing Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the rate of inflation.
Among the key components of Consumers investment program are projects that will enhance customer value. Consumers planned distribution investments of $1.7billion comprise $1.0billion of electric utility projects to improve reliability and increase capacity and $0.7billion of gas utility projects to increase capacity and deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity. Consumers also expects to spend $1.5billion on environmental 49 Table of Contents investments needed to comply with state and federal laws and regulations. An additional $1.2billion of planned reliability investments at Consumers are aimed at reducing outages and improving customer satisfaction; these investments comprise $0.8billion at the electric utility to strengthen circuits and substations, replace poles, and upgrade the Ludington pumped-storage plant, and $0.4billion at the gas utility to replace mains and enhance transmission and storage systems.
Renewable energy projects are another major component of Consumers planned capital investments. Consumers expects to spend $0.5billion on renewable energy investments from 2012 through 2016. The 2008Energy Law requires that at least tenpercent of Consumers electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources by 2015, and it includes requirements for specific capacity additions. Consumers has historically included renewable resources as part of its portfolio, with about fivepercent of its present power supply coming from such renewable sources as hydroelectric, landfill gas, biomass, and wind. In May2011, the MPSC issued an order approving Consumers amended renewable energy plan, with slight modifications. Under the amended plan, Consumers reduced the renewable energy surcharge by an annual amount of $54million, to $23million beginning in September2011, reflecting lower-than-expected costs to comply with renewable energy requirements. In October2011, Consumers filed an application for the biennial review and approval of its renewable energy plan. This filing proposes to reduce further the renewable energy surcharge by an annual amount of $3million, to $20million.
Consumers Smart Grid program, with an estimated total project capital cost of $750million, also represents a major capital investment. The full-scale deployment of advanced metering infrastructure is planned to begin in the second half of 2012 and to continue through 2019. Consumers has spent $140million through 2011 on its Smart Grid program, and expects to spend an additional $260million, following a phased approach, from 2012 through 2016.
In December2011, Consumers formally canceled its plans to build an 830-MW coal-fueled plant at its Karn/Weadock generating complex. This decision reflects present and anticipated market conditions, new environmental standards, and Consumers expectations of the generation sources that will provide the best energy value to customers. Consumers updated its capital investment plan in May 2010, when it deferred development of the now-canceled coal-fueled plant. Consumers plans to make other investments in place of the coal-fueled plant, including installing additional environmental controls on some of its existing coal-fired units and improving reliability.
Also in December 2011, Consumers announced plans to mothball seven of its smaller coal-fueled units effective January2015. Consumers will continue to evaluate its options for the plants, which include:  installing more environmental equipment on the units to reduce emissions further in order to meet new environmental standards and continue to operate the units;  converting the units to natural gas instead of coal;  decommissioning the units; and  a combination of these three options, depending on customer needs and market conditions.
R EGULATION Regulatory matters are a key aspect of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, particularly Consumers rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC. Important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.
Gas Rate Cases: In May2011, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement in Consumers 2010 gas rate case, authorizing a $31million annual rate increase, based on a 10.5percent authorized return on equity. Consumers filed a new general gas rate case in September2011, seeking an annual rate increase of $49million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. In February2012, Consumers filed testimony and exhibits with the MPSC in support of a self-implemented annual rate increase of $23million, based on a 10.5percent authorized return on equity.
50 Table of Contents  Electric Rate Case: In June2011, Consumers filed a new general electric rate case seeking an annual rate increase of $195million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. In December2011, the MPSC issued an order stating that it found good cause to prevent implementation of any amount over $118million. Accordingly, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $118million in December2011, subject to refund with interest.
Revenue Decoupling Mechanisms: In March2011, Consumers filed its first reconciliation of the electric revenue decoupling mechanism, requesting recovery of $27million from customers for the period December2009 through November2010. This mechanism, authorized under the MPSCs 2010 electric rate case order through November2011, allowed Consumers to adjust future electric rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes resulting from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average sales per customer, subject to certain conditions. In February2012, the administrative law judge recommended that the MPSC approve Consumers reconciliation of the electric revenue decoupling mechanism.
Consumers is required to file its second electric revenue decoupling mechanism reconciliation for the period December2010 through November2011 by March2012.
In September2011, Consumers filed its first reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism, requesting recovery of $16million from customers for the period June2010 through May2011. This mechanism, authorized under the MPSCs 2010 gas rate case order, allows Consumers to adjust future gas rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes resulting from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average weather-adjusted sales per customer, subject to certain conditions.
DOE Settlement: In July2011, Consumers entered into an agreement with the DOE to settle for $120million its claims related to the DOEs failure to accept spent nuclear fuel. In September2011, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC regarding the allocation of the $120million settlement amount.
Environmental regulation is another area of importance for CMSEnergy and Consumers, and they are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives to regulate greenhouse gases, as well as related litigation. The EPA has taken steps to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and is expected to propose guidelines for states to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing sources.
In July2011, the EPA finalized CSAPR, which replaces CAIR and requires Michigan and 27 other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that allegedly contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other downwind states. In December2011, due to litigation surrounding CSAPR, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit issued a stay of CSAPR, stating that CAIR would remain in place while the court considers the issues.
Additionally, in December2011, the EPA finalized its MACT emission standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants for electric generating units, calling the final rule MATS. Although numerous parties, including the State of Michigan, have sought to extend the deadline of MATS, it is expected to take effect in 2015. CMSEnergy and Consumers are continuing to assess the impact and cost of complying with CSAPR and MATS.
F INANCIAL P ERFORMANCE IN 2011 AND B EYOND In 2011, CMSEnergys net income available to common stockholders was $415million, and diluted EPS were $1.58. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $324million and diluted EPS of $1.28 in2010. Among the factors contributing to CMSEnergys improved performance in 2011 were benefits from rate orders, which allowed CMSEnergy to increase spending on forestry, equipment maintenance, and other operating activities aimed at improving reliability, and which offset higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service and higher service restoration costs as a result of a series of unusually severe storms in 2011. CMSEnergy also recognized a tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the MCIT in May2011.
51 Table of Contents A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMSEnergys and Consumers performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.
CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that economic conditions in Michigan are improving. Although Michigans economy continues to be affected by the recession and its impact on the states automotive industry and by high unemployment rates, there are indications that the recession has eased in Michigan. Consumers expects its electric sales to increase by about onepercent annually through 2016, driven largely by the continued rise in industrial production. Consumers is projecting that its gas sales will remain stable through 2016. This outlook reflects growth in gas demand offset by energy efficiency and conservation.
As Consumers seeks to continue to receive fair and timely regulatory treatment, delivering customer value will remain a key strategic priority. To keep costs down for its utility customers, Consumers has set goals to achieve further annual productivity improvements. Additionally, Consumers will strive to give priority to capital investments that increase customer value or lower costs.
Consumers expects to continue to have sufficient capacity to fund its investment-based growth plans. CMSEnergy also expects its sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its cash requirements. CMSEnergy and Consumers will continue to monitor developments in the financial and credit markets, as well as government policy responses to those developments, for potential implications for their businesses and their future financial needs.

This variance was due to additional revenues of $92million resulting from a November2010 rate increase and a $20million increase in other revenues, offset largely by the absence, in 2011, of $87million of surcharges in 2010 to recover retirement benefit expenses and certain regulatory assets. Overall, deliveries to end-use customers were 37.8billionkWh in 2011 and 37.7billionkWh in 2010.
For2010, electric delivery revenues increased $266million compared with 2009. This variance included $84million associated with favorable weather in 2010, offset partially by $40million of decreased demand revenues and $19million from lower customer usage. Additionally, revenues increased $32million due to surcharges from MPSC orders allowing recovery of retirement benefit expenses and $100million from authorized rate increases in November2010 and November2009. Revenues also increased $99million due to the absence of a refund ordered in 2009 related to the Big Rock decommissioning case. Other miscellaneous revenue increases totaled $10million. Overall, deliveries to end-use customers were 37.7billionkWh in 2010 and 35.8 billion kWh in 2009.
Other income, net of expenses: For 2011, other income decreased $16million compared with 2010, due to a reduction in the return on certain regulatory assets as a result of their declining balances.
For 2010, other income decreased $27million compared with 2009. This decrease was due primarily to an $8million reduction in the return on certain regulatory assets as a result of their declining balances and to the absence, in 2010, of $9million of gains recognized on land sales in 2009.
Maintenance and other operating expenses: For 2011, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $31million compared with 2010. The increase was due to $28million of higher service restoration costs, caused by a series of unusually severe storms in 2011, a $15million increase in energy optimization program costs, and an $11million increase in uncollectible accounts expense. Additionally, forestry, plant maintenance, and other operating expenses increased $31million in 2011. These increases were offset partially by the absence, in 2011, of $32million of retirement benefit expenses that were recovered in revenues in 2010 and a $22million impairment charge related to Consumers 2010 decision to defer the development of its proposed coal-fueled plant. In December2011, Consumers formally cancelled its plans to build the plant.
For 2010, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $59million compared with 2009. The increase was due primarily to $32million of higher retirement benefit expenses that were recovered in revenues in 2010 and a $22million impairment charge related to Consumers 2010 decision to defer the development of its proposed coal-fueled plant.
54 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization: For2011, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $38million compared with 2010, due to lower amortization expense on certain regulatory assets, offset partially by higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service.
Interest charges: For 2011, interest charges decreased $8 million compared with 2010, primarily from the absence, in 2011, of interest expense on a Michigan use tax assessment.
For 2010, interest charges decreased $23million compared with 2009. The decrease was due to the absence, in 2010, of $31million of interest expense associated with the 2009 Big Rock decommissioning order, offset partially by an $8million increase in other interest charges in 2010, including interest expense on a Michigan use tax assessment.
Income taxes: For 2011, income taxes increased $4million compared with 2010, due to higher electric utility earnings, offset partially by $6 million of benefits including the treatment of plant, property, and equipment, as required by MPSC orders.
For 2010, income taxes increased $80million compared with 2009, due to higher electric utility earnings.

This increase reflected $11million in additional revenues from a May2011 rate increase and $28million from higher customer usage, of which $16million was due to colder weather in 2011. In addition, surcharge and other miscellaneous revenues increased $25million. Gas deliveries, including miscellaneous transportation to end-use customers, were 287.3bcf in 2011, an increase of 14.2bcf, or 5.2percent, compared with 2010.
For 2010, gas delivery revenues increased $60million compared with 2009, due to additional revenues of $54million from an authorized rate increase in May2010. In addition, surcharge and other miscellaneous revenues increased $30million. These increases were offset partially by a $24million reduction due to unfavorable weather in 2010. Gas deliveries, including miscellaneous transportation to end-use customers, were 273.1bcf in 2010, a decrease of 11.2bcf, or 3.9percent, compared with 2009.
Other income, net of expenses: For 2011, other income decreased $9million compared with 2010, due primarily to a reduction in interest income related to secured lending agreements.
Maintenance and other operating expenses: For 2011, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $34million compared with 2010. The increase was due to $24million of higher energy optimization program costs, a $6million increase in uncollectible accounts expense, and $4million in higher distribution operating expenses.
For 2010, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $7million compared with 2009, due primarily to higher energy optimization program costs.
Depreciation and amortization: For 2011, depreciation and amortization expense increased $8million compared with 2010, and for 2010, depreciation and amortization expense increased $4million compared with 2009. Both increases were due to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service.
55 Table of Contents Income taxes: For 2011, income taxes increased $10million compared with 2010, due to higher gas utility earnings and the absence, in 2011, of a benefit related to the Medicare PartD subsidy.
For 2010, income taxes increased $11million compared with 2009, due to higher gas utility earnings.

These after-tax decreases were offset largely by a $28million income tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the MCIT in May 2011 and by the absence, in 2011, of a $25million increase in the environmental remediation liability associated with Bay Harbor.
For 2010, the enterprises segment reported net income of $36million, compared with a net loss of $7million for 2009. The $43million change reflected income of $31million from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a previously sold asset and a $9million benefit related to the MBT. Additionally, income increased $6million due to higher earnings from gas and power sales offset partially by higher maintenance and other operating expenses. These after-tax increases were offset slightly by a $3million decrease associated with Bay Harbor; in 2010, the enterprises segment recorded a $25million after-tax increase in the environmental remediation liability associated with Bay Harbor, compared with a $22million after-tax increase in 2009.

Also contributing to the decrease were lower income tax expense resulting partially from the enactment of the MCIT in May2011 and a $4million benefit from the impact of a final Michigan single business tax assessment for the years 2004 through 2007 that resulted in a tax deficiency less than the amount previously accrued.
For 2010, corporate interest and other net expenses increased $34million compared with 2009, due to the absence, in 2010, of an $18million gain recognized in 2009 on the early retirement of long-term debt related parties and $15million in higher expense related primarily to the MBT. Additionally, interest expense increased $10million due to higher debt levels at higher average interest rates. These items were offset partially by $9million of higher net earnings at EnerBank and lower legal fees.
D ISCONTINUED O PERATIONS For 2011, income of $2million was recorded from discontinued operations due to a legal settlement, compared with a loss from discontinued operations of $23million in 2010 related to prior asset sales.
For 2010, a loss of $23million was recorded from discontinued operations, compared with income of $20million for 2009. The $43million change was due primarily to a $28million gain recognized in 2009 on the expiration of an indemnity for a 2007 asset sale and $10million of additional tax expense in 2010 resulting from an IRS audit adjustment related to a 2003 asset sale.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY CMSEnergy uses dividends from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non-utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMSEnergys subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMSEnergy depends upon each subsidiarys revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its articles of incorporation and potentially by provisions under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act and FERC requirements. For additional details on Consumers dividend restrictions, see Note7, Financings and Capitalization, Dividend Restrictions. For the year ended December31,2011, Consumers paid $374million in common stock dividends to CMSEnergy.
Consumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholders contributions from CMSEnergy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, contribute to its employee benefit plans, and fund its other obligations.
61 Table of Contents CMSEnergys and Consumers access to the financial and capital markets depends on their credit ratings and on market conditions. As evidenced by past financing transactions, CMSEnergy and Consumers have had ready access to these markets and, barring major market dislocations or disruptions, they expect to continue to have such access. If access to these markets were to become diminished or otherwise restricted, however, CMSEnergy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending.

2 On March31,2011, Consumers entered into a $500million secured revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks. This facility has a five-year term and replaced Consumers revolving credit facility that was set to expire in 2012.
3 Obligations under this facility are secured by FMBs of Consumers.
CMSEnergy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. An additional source of liquidity is Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program, which allows it to transfer up to $250million of accounts receivable as a secured borrowing. At December31,2011, $250million of accounts receivable were eligible for transfer under this program.
In December2011, CMSEnergy entered into a $180million unsecured term loan credit agreement. The agreement provides for delayed draws through July20,2012. Outstanding borrowings will bear interest at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5percent and will mature in December2016. CMSEnergy expects to use the proceeds of the draws to finance the redemption of $150million principal amount of the outstanding CMSEnergy floating rate senior notes due 2013 and $29million principal amount of the 7.75percent Trust Preferred Securities. The Trust Preferred Securities were called for redemption in January2012, to be redeemed in late February2012.
62 Table of Contents Certain of CMS Energys and Consumers credit agreements and debt indentures contain covenants that require CMS Energy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios. CMSEnergys $550million revolving credit agreement and its $180million term loan credit agreement specify a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined therein. Certain of CMSEnergys senior notes indenture supplements and its $180million term loan credit agreement specify a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined therein. Consumers revolving credit agreements and its revolving accounts receivable purchase agreement specify a maximum debt-to-capital ratio, as defined therein. At December31,2011, no events of default had occurred with respect to any debt covenants contained in CMS Energy and Consumers credit agreements or debt indentures. CMSEnergy and Consumers were each in compliance with these limits as of December31,2011, as presented in the following table: Credit Agreement or Facility Description Limit Ratio at December31,2011 CMSE NERGY $550million revolving credit agreement and $180million term loan credit agreement DebttoEBITDA  6.0to1.0 4.7 to 1.0 Senior notes indenture InterestCoverage > 1.6 to 1.0 3.8 to 1.0 $180million term loan credit agreement Interest Coverage >2.0to1.0 3.8 to 1.0 C ONSUMERS $500million and $30 million revolving credit agreements Debt to Capital  0.65to1.0 0.49to1.0 $150million revolving credit agreement and $250million accounts receivable purchase agreement Debt to Capital  0.70 to 1.0 0.49 to 1.0 Components of CMSEnergys and Consumers cash management plan include controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for financing and refinancing opportunities. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that their present level of cash and their expected cash flows from operating activities, together with their access to sources of liquidity, will be sufficient to fund their contractual obligations for 2012 and beyond.

These commodities and services include natural gas and associated transportation, electricity, and coal and associated transportation.
Retirement benefits are not included in the table above. For details related to benefit payments, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements : CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries also enter into various arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities are usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum payment that could be required under a number of these indemnity obligations is not estimable; the maximum obligation under indemnities for which such amounts were estimable was $512 million at December 31, 2011. While CMSEnergy and Consumers believe it is unlikely that they will incur any material losses related to indemnities they have not recorded as liabilities, they cannot predict the impact of these contingent obligations on their liquidity and financial condition. For additional details on these and other guarantee arrangements, see Note5, Contingencies and Commitments, Guarantees.
64 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures: Over the next five years, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to make capital investments of $6.6billion. CMSEnergy and Consumers may revise their forecasts of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2012 through 2016: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 FiveYears Total In Millions CMSE NERGY , INCLUDING C ONSUMERS Consumers $ 1,400 $ 1,250 $ 1,380 $ 1,430 $ 1,170 $ 6,630 Enterprises 9 1 1 1 1 13 Total CMSEnergy $ 1,409 $ 1,251 $ 1,381 $ 1,431 $ 1,171 $ 6,643 C ONSUMERS Electric utility operations 1,2 $ 1,080 $ 960 $ 1,090 $ 1,150 $ 890 $ 5,170 Gas utility operations 2 320 290 290 280 280 1,460 Total Consumers $ 1,400 $ 1,250 $ 1,380 $ 1,430 $ 1,170 $ 6,630 1 These amounts include estimates for capital expenditures that may be required by environmental laws, regulations, or potential consent decrees.

OUTLOOK Several business trends and uncertainties may affect CMSEnergys and Consumers financial condition and results of operations. These trends and uncertainties could have a material impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position. For additional details regarding these and other uncertainties, see Forward-Looking Statements and Information; Item1A. Risk Factors; and Note5, Contingencies and Commitments.
C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY B USINESS O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES Balanced Energy Initiative: Consumers balanced energy initiative is a comprehensive energy resource plan designed to meet the short-term and long-term electricity needs of its customers through:  energy efficiency;  demand management;  expanded use of renewable energy;  development of new power plants;  power purchases to complement existing generating sources;  continued operation of existing units; and  potential retirement or mothballing of older generating units.
In December2011, Consumers formally canceled its plans to build an 830-MW coal-fueled plant at its Karn/Weadock generating complex. This decision reflects present and anticipated market conditions, new environmental standards, and Consumers expectations of the generation sources that will provide the best energy value to customers. Consumers also plans to mothball seven of its smaller coal-fueled units effective January2015. Consumers will continue to evaluate its options for the plants, which include:  installing more environmental equipment on the units to reduce emissions further in order to meet new environmental standards and continue to operate the units; 65 Table of Contents  converting the units to natural gas instead of coal;  decommissioning the units; and  a combination of these three options, depending on customer needs and market conditions.
Renewable Energy Plan: Consumers renewable energy plan details how Consumers will meet REC and capacity standards prescribed by the 2008 Energy Law. This law requires Consumers to obtain RECs in an amount equal to at least tenpercent of its electric sales volume (estimated to be 3.5million RECs annually) by 2015. RECs represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers expects to secure its renewable energy requirement each year with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years. At December31,2011, the combination of these sources represented 84percent of Consumers 2015 REC requirement.
The 2008 Energy Law also requires Consumers to obtain 500MW of capacity from renewable energy resources by 2015, either through generation resources owned by Consumers or through agreements to purchase capacity from other parties. To meet its renewable capacity requirements, Consumers expects to add more than 500MW of owned or contracted renewable capacity by 2015. Through December2011, Consumers has contracted for the purchase of 297MW of nameplate capacity from renewable energy suppliers, which represents 59percent of the 2015 renewable capacity requirement.
Consumers has secured more than 82,000acres of land easements in Michigans Huron, Mason, and Tuscola Counties for the potential development of wind generation, and is now collecting wind speed and other meteorological data at those sites. Consumers has entered into construction and supply contracts as well as a contract to purchase wind turbine generators for the construction of Lake Winds Energy Park, a 100-MW wind park in Mason County, which Consumers expects to be operational in late 2012. In July2011, the Mason County Planning Commission voted in favor of granting a special land use permit for the construction of Lake Winds Energy Park. The actions of the Mason County Planning Commission have been upheld by the Mason County Zoning Board of Appeals. The permit has now been appealed to the Mason County Circuit Court. Construction of the Lake Winds Energy Park began in November2011. Consumers will also continue development of Cross Winds Energy Park, its 150-MW wind park in Tuscola County, scheduled for operation by late 2015, as well as seek other opportunities for wind generation development in support of the renewable capacity standards. Upon completion of the Lake Winds and Cross Winds Energy Parks, Consumers will have purchased or constructed 110percent of the 2015 renewable capacity requirement.
Electric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers electric customer deliveries are largely dependent on Michigans economy, which has suffered from economic and financial instability in the automotive and real estate sectors. Consumers believes economic conditions in Michigan are improving, and expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to increase in 2012 by twopercent compared with 2011.
Consumers expects average electric delivery growth of about onepercent annually over the next fiveyears. This increase reflects growth in electric demand, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency programs and appliance efficiency standards. Actual deliveries will depend on:  energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency programs;  fluctuations in weather; and  changes in economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, and housing activity.
The MPSCs 2009 electric rate case order authorized Consumers to implement an electric revenue decoupling mechanism, subject to certain conditions. This decoupling mechanism, which was extended through November2011 in the MPSCs 2010 electric rate case order, allowed Consumers to adjust future electric rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes resulting from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average sales per customer. This mechanism was intended to mitigate the impacts of weather fluctuations, energy efficiency, and conservation on Consumers electric utility revenue.
66 Table of Contents Electric ROA: The Customer Choice Act allows all of Consumers electric customers to buy electric generation service from Consumers or from an alternative electric supplier. The 2008 Energy Law revised the Customer Choice Act by limiting alternative electric supply to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. At December31,2011, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the tenpercent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 785MW of generation service to ROA customers. Based on 2011 weather-adjusted retail sales, Consumers expects 2012 electric deliveries under the ROA program to be at a similar level to 2011.
Electric Transmission: In July2011, FERC issued an order in a rulemaking proceeding concerning regional electric transmission planning and cost allocations. In August2011, Consumers and several other electric utilities filed a joint petition seeking clarification/rehearing of FERCs July order and opposing the allocation methodology.
In a related matter, in July2010, MISO filed a tariff revision with FERC proposing a cost allocation methodology for a new category of transmission projects. In December2010, FERC approved MISOs cost allocation proposal. Under this tariff revision, the cost of these new transmission projects will be spread proportionally across the Midwest Energy Market. Consumers believes that Michigan customers will bear additional costs under MISOs tariff without receiving comparable benefits from these projects. In January2011, Consumers, along with the Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, Detroit Edison, the Michigan Municipal Electric Association, and the Michigan Public Power Agency, filed a request for rehearing with FERC, opposing the allocation methodology in the MISO tariff revision. In October2011, FERC denied this request for rehearing. In December2011, Consumers, along with the Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, Detroit Edison, the Michigan Municipal Electric Association, and the Michigan Public Power Agency, filed a petition for review of FERCs order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the SeventhCircuit. Regardless of the outcome of this appeal, Consumers expects to continue to recover transmission expenses, including those associated with the MISO tariff revision, through the PSCR process.
Electric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers electric utility business. See Note6, Regulatory Matters, Consumers Electric Utility and Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for details on the following electric rate matters:  electric rate case;  PSCR;  Big Rock decommissioning;  electric revenue decoupling mechanism;  energy optimization plan;  uncollectible expense tracking mechanism; and  renewable energy plan.
Pending Electric Rate Case: In June2011, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $195million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested authority to recover new investment in system reliability, environmental compliance, and technology enhancements.
In November2011, the MPSC Staff recommended an annual rate increase of $39million, based on a 9.95percent return on equity. Consumers also filed testimony and exhibits with the MPSC in November2011 in support of a self-implemented annual rate increase of $147million. In December2011, the MPSC issued an order stating that it found good cause to prevent implementation of any amount over $118million. Accordingly, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $118million in December2011, subject to refund with interest.
Pending Power Supply Cost Recovery Plan: Consumers submitted its 2012PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2011. In accordance with its proposed plan, Consumers self-implemented the 2012 PSCR charge beginning in January2012. In February2012, Consumers filed a revised 2012PSCR plan, which reflected significantly reduced costs.
67 Table of Contents Electric Depreciation: In June2011, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement in Consumers electric depreciation case, authorizing a $19million increase in annual depreciation expense. The new depreciation rates will go into effect with a final order in Consumers next electric rate case.
Electric Environmental Estimates: Consumers operations are subject to various state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur expenditures of $1.5billion from 2012 through 2018 to continue to comply with the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and numerous state and federal environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters: Air Quality: In July2011, the EPA released CSAPR, a final replacement rule for CAIR, which requires Michigan and 27 other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that allegedly contribute to ground level ozone and fine particle pollution in other downwind states. This rule had mandated emission reductions beginning in 2012, which CMS Energy and Consumers were prepared to meet through fuel blend changes. In December2011, due to litigation surrounding CSAPR, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit issued a stay of CSAPR, stating that CAIR would remain in place while the court considers the issues. The court has set a briefing schedule, but there is no timeline for a decision or order from the court.
In December2011, the EPA finalized its MACT emission standards for electric generating units, based on Section112 of the Clean Air Act, calling the final rule MATS. Under the final rule, all of Consumers coal-fueled electric generating units will require additional controls for hazardous air pollutants. Generally, existing units must meet the standards within three to four years of issuance of the final rule.
Presently, Consumers strategy to comply with CAIR, CSAPR, and MATS involves the installation of state-of-the-art emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate CSAPR and MATS in conjunction with other EPA rulemakings, litigation, and congressional action. This evaluation could result in:  additional or accelerated environmental compliance costs related to Consumers coal-fueled power plants;  a change in the fuel mix at coal-fueled and oil-fueled power plants;  changes in how certain plants are used; and  the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some or all of Consumers older, smaller generating units.
The MDEQ renewed and issued the B.C.Cobb Renewable Operating Permit in August2011 after an extensive review and a public comment period. In October2011, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a petition with the EPA to object to the MDEQs issuance of the state Renewable Operating Permit, alleging that the facility is not in compliance with certain provisions of the Clean Air Act, including NSR and TitleV. Consumers responded to these allegations in December2011. The EPA could either deny the petition outright or grant the petition and remand the matter to the MDEQ for further action. Consumers believes these claims are baseless, but is unable to predict the outcome of this petition.
Greenhouse Gases: In the recent past, there have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, and national levels that involve the regulation of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives and also follows litigation involving greenhouse gases. Consumers believes Congress may eventually pass greenhouse gas legislation, but is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.
In 2010, the EPA released its Prevention of Significant Deterioration and TitleV Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which sets greenhouse gas emissions limits that define when permits are required for new and existing industrial facilities under NSRPSD and TitleV Operating Permit programs. Numerous parties have challenged this rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit, and Consumers is monitoring this litigation. Consumers does not expect to incur significant expenditures to comply with this rule.
In December2010, the EPA entered into a settlement agreement with certain states and environmental groups wherein in September2011 the EPA was to propose new source performance standards for greenhouse 68 Table of Contents gases at new and modified power plants pursuant to Section111(b) of the Clean Air Act and finalize the standards in May2012. The EPA did not meet the September2011 deadline, but is expected to issue the proposed standards by March31,2012. The EPA is also expected to propose emissions guidelines for the states to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing generating units under Section111(d) of the Clean Air Act. Under the expected schedule, states will need to submit plans to the EPA within nine months of issuance of the final rule and guidelines. Consumers will continue to monitor activity from this settlement agreement and any proposed new source performance standards regulations.
Litigation, as well as federal laws, EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if enacted or ratified, could require Consumers to replace equipment, install additional emission control equipment, purchase emission allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.
In2011, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fueled power plants owned by Consumers, excluding the portion of Campbell Unit 3 that is owned by others, were 16million metric tons. During the same period, coal-fueled plants owned by the enterprises segment emitted 570,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.
CCBs: In June2010, the EPA proposed rules regulating CCBs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Michigan already regulates CCBs as low-hazard industrial waste. The EPA proposed a range of alternatives for regulating CCBs, including regulation as either a non-hazardous waste or a hazardous waste. If coal ash were regulated as a hazardous waste, Consumers would likely cease the beneficial re-use of this product, which would result in a significant increase in the amount of coal ash requiring costly disposal. Additionally, if the cost of upgrading existing coal ash disposal areas to meet hazardous waste landfill standards were to become economically prohibitive, existing coal ash disposal areas could close, requiring Consumers to find costly alternative arrangements for disposal. Consumers is unable to predict the impacts from this wide range of possible outcomes, but significant expenditures are likely.
Water: In March2011, the EPA issued a proposed rule to regulate existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems under Section316(b) of the Clean Water Act aimed at reducing alleged harmful impacts on fish and shellfish. Consumers continues to evaluate this proposed rule and its potential impacts on Consumers plants. A final rule is expected in July2012. Consumers also expects the EPA to propose new regulations in July2012 for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants that will require physical and/or chemical treatment facilities for all wastewater. A final rule is expected in 2014.
PCBs: In April2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, indicating that it is considering a variety of regulatory actions with respect to PCBs. One proposal aims to phase out equipment containing PCBs by 2025. Another proposal eliminates an exemption for small equipment containing PCBs. To comply with this proposed rule, Consumers could incur substantial costs associated with existing electrical equipment potentially containing PCBs. A proposal is expected in late 2012.
Other electric environmental matters could have a major impact on Consumers outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Note5, Contingencies and Commitments, Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies  Electric Environmental Matters.
C ONSUMERS G AS U TILITY B USINESS O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES Gas Deliveries: Consumers believes economic conditions in Michigan are improving, and expects weather-adjusted gas deliveries to increase in 2012 by about onepercent compared with 2011. Over the next five years, Consumers expects average gas deliveries to remain stable. This outlook reflects modest growth in gas demand offset by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary from this trend due to:  fluctuations in weather;  use by independent power producers; 69 Table of Contents  availability and development of renewable energy sources;  changes in gas prices;  Michigan economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity;  the price of competing energy sources or fuels; and  energy efficiency and conservation impacts.
A decoupling mechanism was authorized by the MPSC in Consumers 2009 gas rate case, subject to certain conditions. This mechanism, which was extended in the MPSCs 2010 gas rate case order, allows Consumers to adjust future gas rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes resulting from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average weather-adjusted sales per customer. The mechanism does not provide rate adjustments for changes in sales volumes arising from weather fluctuations. This mechanism is intended to mitigate the impacts of energy efficiency programs, conservation, and changes in economic conditions on Consumers gas utility revenue.
Gas Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers gas utility business. See Note6, Regulatory Matters, Consumers Gas Utility and Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for details on Consumers gas rate case, GCR, and gas revenue decoupling mechanism.
Pending Gas Rate Case: In September2011, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $49million based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested recovery for investments made to enhance safety, system reliability, and operational efficiencies that improve service to customers. In February2012, the MPSC Staff recommended an annual rate reduction of $22million, based on a 9.95percent return on equity. Consumers also filed testimony and exhibits with the MPSC in February2012 in support of a self-implemented annual rate increase of $23million, based on a 10.5percent authorized return on equity.
Presented in the following table are the components of the rate reduction recommended by the MPSC Staff and Consumers proposed self-implemented rate increase: Components of the Rate Increase RateReduction Recommendedby the MPSC Staff Consumers Proposed Self- Implemented Increase Difference In Millions Investment in rate base $ 17 $ 22 $ (5 ) Uncollectible accounts 3 15 (12 ) Cost of capital (11 ) 1 (12 ) Gross margin (18 ) (11 ) (7 ) Operating and maintenance costs (13 ) (4 ) (9 ) Total $ (22 ) $ 23 $ (45 ) Pending Gas Cost Recovery Plan :Consumers submitted its 2012-2013 GCR plan to the MPSC in December2011. In accordance with its proposed plan, Consumers expects to self-implement the 2012-2013 GCR charge beginning in April2012.
Gas Pipeline Safety: In January2012, President Obama signed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The law reauthorizes existing federal pipeline safety programs of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration through 2015 and it contains provisions mandating:  an increase in the maximum fine for safety violations to $2million;  an increase in the number of pipeline inspectors; 70 Table of Contents  a study regarding application of integrity management requirements outside of high consequence areas;  a survey regarding existing plans for safe management and replacement of cast iron pipelines;  prescribed notification and on-site incident response times;  installation of automatic or remotely controlled shut-off valves on new or replaced pipelines where feasible;  verification of maximum allowable operating pressure of pipelines in populated areas; and  pressure testing (or equivalent) of previously untested pipelines.
Consumers continues to comply with laws and regulations governing natural gas pipeline safety. These laws and regulations could cause Consumers to incur significant additional costs related to its natural gas pipeline safety programs. Consumers expects that it would be able to recover the costs in rates, consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with laws and regulations.
Gas Environmental Estimates: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23former MGP sites. For additional details, see Note5, Contingencies and Commitments, Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies  Gas Environmental Matters.
The Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule requires facilities engaging in the distribution of natural gas to collect data on greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion of natural gas. In2011, Consumers estimated that carbon dioxide emissions from its customers were 16million metric tons.
C ONSUMERS O THER O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES Smart Grid: Consumers grid modernization effort continues, with the recent selection of a vendor that will provide smart electric meters and a cellular communications network to allow Consumers to transmit and receive electric usage information from customers homes and businesses. Smart meters are designed to allow customers to monitor and manage their energy usage, which should help reduce demand during critical peak times, resulting in lower peak capacity requirements. The installation of smart meters should also provide operational benefits to Consumers. Consumers intends to use a phased implementation approach, beginning deployment in the second half of 2012 and continuing through 2019. Consumers also plans to install communication modules on gas meters in areas where Consumers provides both electricity and natural gas to customers.
E NTERPRISES O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES The primary focus with respect to CMSEnergys remaining non-utility businesses is to optimize cash flow and maximize the value of their assets.
Trends, uncertainties, and other matters that could have a material impact on CMSEnergys consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include:  indemnity and environmental remediation obligations at Bay Harbor;  obligations related to a tax claim from the government of Equatorial Guinea;  the outcome of certain legal proceedings;  impacts of declines in electricity prices on the profitability of the enterprises segments generating units;  representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMSEnergy or its subsidiaries in connection with previous sales of assets;  changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings; 71 Table of Contents  changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation; and  economic conditions in Michigan, including population trends and housing activity.
For additional details regarding the enterprises segments uncertainties, see Note5, Contingencies and Commitments.
O THER O UTLOOK AND U NCERTAINTIES EnerBank: EnerBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMSCapital, is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured home improvement loans. EnerBank represented twopercent of CMSEnergys net assets at December31,2011, and twopercent of CMSEnergys net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December31,2011. The carrying value of EnerBanks loan portfolio was $480million at December31,2011. Its loan portfolio was funded primarily by deposit liabilities of $462million. Twelve-month rolling average default rates on loans held by EnerBank have declined from 1.4percent at December31,2010 to 0.9percent at December31,2011. CMS Energy is required both by law and by contract to provide financial support, including infusing additional capital, to ensure that EnerBank satisfies mandated capital requirements and has sufficient liquidity to operate. Presently, EnerBank meets or exceeds all of its capital requirements.
Litigation: CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Note5, Contingencies and Commitments and Note6, Regulatory Matters.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and related information are important to an understanding of CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Note1, Significant Accounting Policies.
U SE OF E STIMATES AND A SSUMPTIONS In the preparation of CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMSEnergy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, the effects of regulation, indemnities, and contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMSEnergy and Consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, CMSEnergy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved.
Fair Value Measurements: CMSEnergy and Consumers have assets and liabilities that are accounted for or disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require 72 Table of Contents significant judgment. For a detailed discussion of the valuation techniques and inputs used to calculate fair value measurements, see Note4, Fair Value Measurements. Details about the fair value measurements for the Pension Plan and OPEB plan assets are included in Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Income Taxes: The amount of income taxes paid by CMSEnergy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMSEnergys judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMSEnergy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMSEnergys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time.
Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMSEnergy and Consumers assess the recoverability of their long-lived assets and equity method investments by performing impairment tests if certain triggering events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary. CMSEnergy and Consumers base their evaluations of impairment on such indicators as:  the nature of the assets;  projected future economic benefits;  regulatory and political environments;  historical and future cash flow and profitability measurements; and  other external market conditions and factors.
The estimates CMSEnergy and Consumers use may change over time, which could have a material impact on their consolidated financial statements. For additional details, see Note20, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.
Unbilled Revenues: CMSEnergys and Consumers customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as accounts receivable on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated balance sheets, were $387million at December31,2011 and $439million at December31,2010.
A CCOUNTING FOR THE E FFECTS OF I NDUSTRY R EGULATION Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators decisions on its financial statements. Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings.
Under electric and gas rate case orders issued by the MPSC in2009 and 2010, Consumers was granted authority to implement revenue decoupling mechanisms, subject to certain conditions. The electric revenue decoupling mechanism, which was extended through November2011 in the 2010 electric rate case order, allowed Consumers to adjust future electric rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes resulting from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average sales per customer. The gas revenue decoupling mechanism is similar, but does not adjust customer rates for changes in sales volumes resulting from weather fluctuations. Consumers accounts for these programs as alternative-revenue programs that meet the criteria for recognizing the effects of decoupling adjustments on revenue as electricity and gas are delivered.
In September2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the 73 Table of Contents MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC.
To the extent that decoupling and energy optimization revenues are collected beyond the maximum period prescribed by authoritative accounting guidance for alternative revenue programs, such revenues are not recognized until they are collected from customers.
Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing; however, the rates that Consumers self-implements may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, it records a provision for revenue subject to refund. A final rate order could differ materially from Consumers estimates underlying its self-implemented rates, giving rise to accounting adjustments. Under accounting rules for prior period adjustments, CMSEnergy and Consumers may need to record such differences, if they are specifically identifiable to prior interim periods, as revisions to those periods.
For additional details, see Note6, Regulatory Matters.
F INANCIAL AND D ERIVATIVE I NSTRUMENTS AND M ARKET R ISK I NFORMATION Financial Instruments: Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the equity securities are reported, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings. Unrealized gains resulting from changes in fair value of the debt securities are reported, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI. Unrealized losses on the debt securities, if significant, are considered other than temporary and reported in earnings since these securities are managed by an independent investment manager that can sell the securities at its own discretion.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting are complex and often require significant judgment in application. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. The fair values calculated for CMSEnergys and Consumers derivatives may change significantly as commodity prices and volatilities change. The cash returns actually realized on derivatives may be different from their estimated fair values. For additional details on CMSEnergys and Consumers derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, and Note10, Derivative Instruments.
Market Risk Information: CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and investment security prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to limit exposure to these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into these contracts using established policies and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of senior management representatives and a risk committee consisting of business unit managers.
These contracts contain credit risk, which is the risk that the counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. CMSEnergy and Consumers reduce this risk using established policies and procedures, such as evaluating counterparties credit quality and setting collateral requirements as necessary. If terms permit, standard agreements are used that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with the same counterparty. Given these policies, present exposures, and credit reserves, CMSEnergy and Consumers do not expect a material adverse effect on their financial position or future earnings because of counterparty nonperformance.
74 Table of Contents The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial instruments, including derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of tenpercent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were to exceed tenpercent.
Interest-Rate Risk: CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate financing instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital.

The annual earnings exposure related to variable-rate financing was insignificant for both CMSEnergy and Consumers at December31,2011 and 2010, assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of tenpercent.
Investment Securities Price Risk: Through investments in debt and equity securities, CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to changes in interest rates and price fluctuations in equity markets. The following table shows the potential effect of adverse changes in interest rates and fluctuations in equity prices on CMSEnergys and Consumers available-for-sale investments.

75 Table of Contents R ETIREMENT B ENEFITS Pension :CMSEnergy and Consumers have external trust funds to provide retirement pension benefits to their employees under a non-contributory, defined benefit Pension Plan. On September1,2005, the defined benefit Pension Plan was closed to new participants and CMSEnergy and Consumers implemented the qualified DCCP, which provides an employer contribution of sixpercent of base pay to the existing 401(k) plan. An employee contribution is not required to receive the plans employer cash contribution. All employees hired on or after September1,2005 participate in this plan as part of their retirement benefit program. Previous cash balance Pension Plan participants also participate in the DCCP as of September1,2005. Additional pay credits under the cash balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of that date.
401(k) :CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an employer match in their 401(k) plan equal to 60percent on eligible contributions up to the first sixpercent of an employees wages.
OPEB :CMSEnergy and Consumers provide postretirement health and life benefits under their OPEB plan to qualifying retired employees.
CMSEnergy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:  life expectancies;  discount rates;  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets;  rate of compensation increases; and  expected health care costs.
A change in these assumptions could change significantly CMSEnergys and Consumers recorded liabilities and associated expenses.
Presented in the following table are estimates of CMSEnergys and Consumers pension cost, OPEB cost, and cash contributions through 2014: PensionCost OPEBCost PensionContribution OPEBContribution In Millions CMSE NERGY , INCLUDING C ONSUMERS 2012 $ 103 $ 75 $  $ 65 2013 104 69  75 2014 90 64 106 69 C ONSUMERS 2012 $ 100 $ 77 $  $ 64 2013 101 71  74 2014 88 66 104 68 Contribution estimates include amounts required and discretionary contributions. Consumers pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process. Actual future pension cost and contributions will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the Pension Plan.
Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the Pension Plan assets by 0.25percentage point (from 7.75percent to 7.50percent) would increase estimated pension cost for 2012 by $4million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers. Lowering the discount rate by 0.25percentage point (from 4.90percent to 4.65percent) would increase estimated pension cost for 2012 by $5million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers.

76 Table of Contents A SSET R ETIREMENT O BLIGATIONS CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives if there is a legal obligation to remove them. CMSEnergy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove some of their assets at the end of their useful lives. CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected present value technique that reflects assumptions about costs, inflation, and profit margin that third parties would require to assume the obligation.

93 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Corporate Structure: CMSEnergy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. CMSEnergy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMSEnergy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility investments and operations. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility.
Principles of Consolidation: CMSEnergy and Consumers prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. CMSEnergys consolidated financial statements comprise CMSEnergy, Consumers, CMSEnterprises, and all other entities in which CMSEnergy has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Consumers consolidated financial statements comprise Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy uses the equity method of accounting for investments in companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they have significant influence over operations and financial policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy and Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.
Use of Estimates: CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Policy: CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize revenue from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the transportation, processing, and storage of natural gas, when services are provided. CMSEnergy and Consumers record unbilled revenue for the estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. CMSEnergy and Consumers record sales tax net and exclude it from revenue. CMSEnergy recognizes revenue on sales of marketed electricity, natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.
Alternative-Revenue Programs: Under electric and gas rate case orders issued by the MPSC in2009 and 2010, Consumers was granted authority to implement revenue decoupling mechanisms. The electric revenue decoupling mechanism adjusts customer rates to collect or refund the change in marginal revenue arising from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the electric rate case order and actual average sales per customer. The gas revenue decoupling mechanism is similar, but does not adjust customer rates for changes in sales volumes resulting from weather fluctuations. Consumers accounts for these programs as alternative-revenue programs that meet the criteria for recognizing the effects of decoupling adjustments on revenue as electricity and gas are delivered. For details on Consumers decoupling mechanisms, see Note6, Regulatory Matters.
In September2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC.
Self-Implemented Rates: Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing if the MPSC has not issued an order in the case. The MPSC then has another six months to issue a final order. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within that period, the filed rates are considered approved. If the MPSC issues a final order within that period, the rates that Consumers self-implemented may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, then Consumers records a provision for revenue subject to refund. For details on Consumers self-implemented rates, see Note6, Regulatory Matters.
94 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable comprise trade receivables and unbilled receivables. CMSEnergy and Consumers record their accounts receivable at cost, which approximates fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses, managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with customers. CMSEnergy and Consumers charge off accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.
Allowance for Uncollectible Notes Receivable: The allowance for uncollectible notes receivable is a valuation allowance to reflect possible credit losses. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses and decreased by note charge-offs net of recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance required using historical loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors. Notes deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance when the loss is confirmed, but no later than the point at which a note becomes 120 days past due. For further details about CMSEnergys notes receivable, see Note9, Financial Instruments and Note11, Notes Receivable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers record estimated liabilities for contingencies on their consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. CMSEnergy and Consumers expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on estimates of work performed. This policy also applies to any fees incurred on behalf of employees and officers under indemnification agreements; such fees are billed directly to CMSEnergy or Consumers.
Debt Issuance Costs, Discounts, Premiums, and Refinancing Costs: CMSEnergy and Consumers defer issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with long-term debt and amortize those amounts over the terms of the debt issues. For the non-regulated portions of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, refinancing costs are expensed as incurred. For the regulated portions of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with refinanced debt are amortized over the term of the newly issued debt.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value on their consolidated balance sheets. Each reporting period, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. Since none of CMSEnergys or Consumers derivatives has been designated as an accounting hedge, all changes in fair value are reported in earnings. For a discussion of how CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the fair value of their derivatives, see Note4, Fair Value Measurements. For additional details regarding derivative instruments, see Note10, Derivative Instruments.
Determination of Pension and OPEB MRV of Plan Assets: CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for pension plan assets as the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMSEnergy and Consumers reflect each years gain or loss in the MRV in equal amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was determined. CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for OPEB plan assets as the fair value of assets on the measurement date. CMSEnergy and Consumers use the MRV in the calculation of net pension and OPEB costs. For further details, see Note 12, Retirement Benefits.
Earnings Per Share: CMSEnergy calculates basic and diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of dilutive stock options, warrants, and convertible securities. CMSEnergy computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury stock 95 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) method or the if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which are those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note8, Earnings Per Share  CMSEnergy.
Financial Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers record debt and equity securities classified as available for sale at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are determined on a specific-identification basis. CMSEnergy and Consumers report unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of the equity securities, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings. CMSEnergy and Consumers report unrealized gains resulting from changes in fair value of the debt securities, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI. Unrealized losses on the debt securities, if significant, are considered other than temporary and reported in earnings since these securities are managed by an independent investment manager that can sell the securities at its own discretion. For additional details regarding financial instruments, see Note9, Financial Instruments.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMSEnergy and Consumers perform tests of impairment if certain triggering events occur, or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.
CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow analyses.
CMSEnergy also assesses equity method investments for impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This assessment requires CMSEnergy to determine the fair value of the equity method investment. CMSEnergy determines fair value using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment. CMSEnergy records an impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary.
For additional details, see Note20, Asset Sales, Discontinued Operations, and Impairment Charges.
Inventory: CMSEnergy and Consumers use the weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas, recoverable base gas in underground storage facilities, and materials and supplies inventory. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and they classify these amounts as generating plant fuel stock on their consolidated balance sheets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers classify RECs and emission allowances as materials and supplies inventory and use the weighted average method to remove amounts from inventory. RECs and emission allowances are used to satisfy compliance obligations related to the generation of power.
CMSEnergy and Consumers use the lower-of-cost-or-market method to evaluate inventory for impairment.
MISO Transactions: MISO requires the submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. Consumers and CMSERM account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and day-ahead markets, and they net transactions across all MISO energy market locations. CMSEnergy and Consumers record net purchases in a single hour in purchased and interchange power and net sales in a single hour in operating revenue on the consolidated statements of income. They record net sale billing adjustments upon invoice receipt, record expense accruals for future net purchases adjustments based on historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses upon invoice receipt.
96 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Property Taxes: Property taxes are based on the taxable value of Consumers real and personal property assessed by local taxing authorities. Consumers records property tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied based on Consumers budgeted customer sales. The deferred property tax balance represents the amount of Consumers accrued property tax that will be recognized over future governmental fiscal periods.
Reclassifications: CMSEnergy and Consumers have reclassified certain prior-period amounts on their consolidated financial statements to conform to the presentation for the current period. These reclassifications did not affect consolidated net income or cash flows for the periods presented.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents: CMSEnergy and Consumers have restricted cash and cash equivalents dedicated for repayment of Securitization bonds and for payment under performance guarantees. CMSEnergy and Consumers classify these amounts as a current asset if they relate to payments that could or will occur within one year.
2: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS N EW A CCOUNTING S TANDARDS N OT Y ET E FFECTIVE ASU2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income: This standard, effective January1,2012 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, eliminates the option of reporting other comprehensive income and its components on the statement of changes in equity. Presently, both CMSEnergy and Consumers use this option for their consolidated financial statements. Under the standard, entities will be required to present either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, containing both net income and components of other comprehensive income, or two separate consecutive statements. This standard will affect only the presentation of comprehensive income on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated financial statements.
ASU2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S.GAAP and IFRSs: This standard, effective January1,2012 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, is the result of a joint project of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board. The primary objective of the standard is to ensure that fair value has the same meaning under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and to establish common fair value measurement guidance in the two sets of standards. The standard does not change the overall fair value model in GAAP, but it amends various fair value principles and establishes additional disclosure requirements. This standard will not impact CMSEnergys or Consumers consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position, but will require additional disclosures.

When measuring fair value, CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  Level1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other than Level1 prices. Level2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in inactive markets, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, credit risks, default rates, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMSEnergys or Consumers own assumptions about how market participants would value their assets and liabilities.
To the extent possible, CMSEnergy and Consumers use quoted market prices or other observable market pricing data in valuing assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If this information is unavailable, they use market-corroborated data or reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. CMSEnergy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets: The nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of various mutual funds that are valued using a market approach. CMSEnergy and Consumers value 101 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) these assets using the daily quoted net asset values that are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund. CMSEnergy and Consumers report these assets in other non-current assets on their consolidated balance sheets.
SERP Assets: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their SERP assets using a market approach, incorporating prices and other relevant information from market transactions. The SERP cash equivalents consist of a money market fund with daily liquidity. The SERP invests in mutual funds that hold primarily fixed-income instruments of varying maturities. In order to meet their investment objectives, the funds hold investment-grade debt securities, and may invest a portion of their assets in high-yield securities, foreign debt, and derivative instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers value these funds using the daily quoted net asset values that are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund.
At December31,2010, the SERP held state and municipal bonds, which were valued using a matrix pricing model incorporating Level2 market-based information. The fair value of the bonds was derived from various observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, bond ratings, and general information on market movements normally considered by market participants when pricing such debt securities.
CMSEnergy and Consumers report their SERP assets in other non-current assets on their consolidated balance sheets. For additional details about SERP securities, see Note9, Financial Instruments.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Liabilities: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect what is owed to the plan participants in accordance with their investment elections. CMSEnergy and Consumers report these liabilities in other non-current liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their derivative instruments using either a market approach that incorporates information from market transactions, or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount. CMSEnergy has exchange-traded derivative contracts that are valued based on Level1 quoted prices, as well as derivatives valued using Level2 inputs, including commodity market prices, interest rates, credit ratings, default rates, and market-based seasonality factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers have classified certain derivatives as Level3 since the fair value measurements incorporate pricing assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions. At December31, 2011, the most significant derivatives classified as Level3 were a power option sold by CMSERM and FTRs held by Consumers. At December31, 2010, the most significant derivative classified as Level 3 was an electricity sales agreement held by CMS ERM. In valuing their derivative instruments not classified as Level1, CMSEnergy and Consumers may incorporate adjustments for credit risk, or the risk of nonperformance, as deemed appropriate. For additional details about derivative contracts, see Note10, Derivative Instruments.

The fair value was determined based on the price that CMSEnergy received for the sale of these assets, which closed in January2011. CMSEnergy had no other nonrecurring fair value measurements and Consumers had no nonrecurring fair value measurements during the years ended December31,2010 and 2009.
103 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 5: CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS CMSEnergy and Consumers are involved in various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. Depending on the specific issues, the resolution of these contingencies could have a material effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In their disclosures of these matters, CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss when such an estimate can be made. Disclosures that state that CMSEnergy or Consumers cannot predict the outcome of a matter indicate that they are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss for the matter.
CMSE NERGY C ONTINGENCIES Gas Index Price Reporting Investigation: In 2002, CMSEnergy notified appropriate regulatory and governmental agencies that some employees at CMSMST and CMSField Services appeared to have provided inaccurate information regarding natural gas trades to various energy industry publications which compile and report index prices. Although CMSEnergy has not received any formal notification that the DOJ has completed its investigation, the DOJs last request for information occurred in 2003, and CMSEnergy completed its response to this request in 2004. CMSEnergy is unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ investigation and what effect, if any, the investigation will have on CMSEnergy.
Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation: CMSEnergy, along with CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas,Inc., and Cantera Gas Company, are named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting to publications that report trade information. Allegations include manipulation of NYMEX natural gas futures and options prices, price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The following provides more detail on these proceedings:  In 2005, CMSEnergy, CMSMST, and CMSField Services were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in Kansas state court, Learjet,Inc., etal. v. Oneok,Inc., etal. The complaint alleges that during the putative class period, January1, 2000 through October31, 2002, the defendants engaged in a scheme to violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiffs are seeking statutory full consideration damages consisting of the full consideration paid by plaintiffs for natural gas allegedly purchased from defendants.
In 2007, a class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical Center, etal. v. Oneok,Inc. etal., was filed in Missouri state court alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws. Defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSField Services, and CMSMST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri antitrust law in connection with their natural gas reporting activities.
Breckenridge Brewery of Colorado,LLC and BBDAcquisitionCo. v. Oneok,Inc., etal., a class action complaint brought on behalf of retail direct purchasers of natural gas in Colorado, was filed in Colorado state court in 2006. Defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSField Services, and CMSMST, are alleged to have violated the Colorado Antitrust Act of1992 in connection with their natural gas reporting activities. Plaintiffs are seeking full refund damages.
A class action complaint, ArandellCorp., etal. v. XCELEnergyInc., etal., was filed in 2006 in Wisconsin state court on behalf of Wisconsin commercial entities that purchased natural gas between January1, 2000 and October31, 2002. The defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSERM, and Cantera Gas Company, are alleged to have violated Wisconsins antitrust statute. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration damages, plus exemplary damages and attorneys fees. After dismissal on jurisdictional grounds in 2009, plaintiffs filed a new complaint in the U.S.District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. In 2010, the MDL judge issued an opinion and order granting the 104 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) CMSEnergy defendants motion to dismiss the Michigan complaint on statute-of-limitations grounds and all CMSEnergy defendants have been dismissed from the Arandell (Michigan) action.
Another class action complaint, Newpage Wisconsin System v. CMSERM, etal., was filed in 2009 in circuit court in Wood County, Wisconsin, against CMSEnergy, CMSERM, Cantera Gas Company, and others. The plaintiff is seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs, interest, and attorneys fees.
In 2005, J.P.Morgan Trust Company, in its capacity as Trustee of the FLILiquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas state court against CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, and others. The complaint alleges various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiff is seeking statutory full consideration damages for its purchases of natural gas in 2000 and 2001.
After removal to federal court, all of the cases described above were transferred to the MDL. CMSEnergy was dismissed from the Learjet, Heartland, and J.P.Morgan cases in 2009, but other CMSEnergy defendants remained parties. All CMSEnergy defendants were dismissed from the Breckenridge case in 2009. In 2010, CMSEnergy and Cantera Gas Company were dismissed from the Newpage case and the Arandell (Wisconsin) case was reinstated against CMSERM. In July2011, all claims against remaining CMSEnergy defendants in the MDL cases were dismissed based on FERC preemption. Plaintiffs have filed appeals in all of the cases. The issues on appeal are whether the district court erred in dismissing the cases based on FERC preemption and denying the plaintiffs motions for leave to amend their complaints to add a federal Sherman Act antitrust claim. The plaintiffs did not appeal the dismissal of CMSEnergy as a defendant in these cases, but other CMSEnergy entities remain as defendants.
These cases involve complex facts, a large number of similarly situated defendants with different factual positions, and multiple jurisdictions. Presently, any estimate of liability would be highly speculative; the amount of CMSEnergys possible loss would be based on widely varying models previously untested in this context. If the outcome after appeals is unfavorable, these cases could have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Bay Harbor: As part of the development of Bay Harbor by certain subsidiaries of CMSEnergy, and under an agreement with the MDEQ, third parties constructed a golf course and park over several abandoned CKD piles left over from the former cement plant operations on the Bay Harbor site. The third parties also undertook a series of response activities, including constructing a leachate collection system in one area where CKD-impacted groundwater was entering Little Traverse Bay. Leachate is produced when water enters into the CKD piles. In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its interest in Bay Harbor, but retained its obligations under environmental indemnities entered into at the start of the project.
In 2005, the EPA, along with CMSLand and CMSCapital, voluntarily executed an Administrative Order on Consent under Superfund, and the EPA approved a Removal Action Work Plan to address contamination issues. Collection systems required under the plan have been installed and effectiveness monitoring of the systems at the shoreline is ongoing. CMSLand, CMSCapital, and the EPA agreed upon augmentation measures to address areas where pH measurements were not satisfactory. Several augmentation measures were implemented and completed in 2009, with the remaining measure completed in 2010.
In May2011, CMSEnergy received approval from the EPA on a revised scope of remedies that CMSEnergy had submitted in December2010. CMSEnergy reached a tentative agreement with the MDEQ in December2011 that identifies the final remedies at the site. The parties are awaiting EPA review prior to finalizing the agreement. In December2010, the MDEQ issued an NPDES permit that authorizes CMSLand to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay. This permit requires renewal every five years. Discharge of treated leachate under the permit has commenced. Additionally, CMSLand has committed to investigate the potential for a deep injection well on the Bay Harbor site as an alternative long-term solution to the leachate 105 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) disposal issue. In 2008, the MDEQ and the EPA granted permits for CMSLand or its wholly owned subsidiary, Beeland GroupLLC, to construct and operate an off-site deep injection well in Antrim County, Michigan, to dispose of leachate from Bay Harbor. Certain environmental groups, a local township, and a local county filed lawsuits appealing the permits and seeking an injunction. A temporary restraining order was issued by the trial court. The legal proceeding was stayed in 2009 and can be renewed by either party at any time.
Various claims have been brought against CMSLand or its affiliates, including CMSEnergy, alleging environmental damage to property, loss of property value, insufficient disclosure of environmental matters, breach of agreement relating to access, or other matters. In October2010, CMSLand and other parties received a demand for payment from the EPA in the amount of $7million, plus interest, whereby the EPA is seeking recovery, as allowed under Superfund, of the EPAs response costs incurred at the Bay Harbor site. CMSLand communicated to the EPA in November2010 that it does not believe that this is a valid claim.
CMSLand and CMSCapital, the MDEQ, the EPA, and other parties continue to negotiate the long-term remedy for the Bay Harbor site, including:  the disposal of leachate;  the location and design of collection lines and upstream water diversion systems;  application of criteria for various substances such as mercury; and  other matters that are likely to affect the scope of response activities that CMSLand and CMSCapital may be obligated to undertake.
CMSEnergy has recorded a cumulative charge related to Bay Harbor of $224million, which includes accretion expense. At December31,2011, CMSEnergy had a recorded liability of $77million for its remaining obligations. CMSEnergy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of 4.34percent and an inflation rate of onepercent on annual operating and maintenance costs. CMSEnergy based the discount rate on the interest rate for 30-year U.S.Treasury securities at December31,2010. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $100million. CMSEnergy expects to pay $21million during 2012, $8million in 2013, $4million in 2014, $4million in 2015, $5million in 2016, and the remaining amount thereafter on long-term liquid disposal and operating and maintenance costs.
CMSEnergys estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are additional major changes in circumstances or assumptions, including but not limited to:  inability to complete the present long-term water disposal strategy at a reasonable cost;  delays in implementing the present long-term water disposal strategy;  requirements to alter the present long-term water disposal strategy upon expiration of the NPDES permit if the MDEQ or EPA identify a more suitable alternative;  an increase in the number of contamination areas;  different remediation techniques;  the nature and extent of contamination;  inability to reach agreement with the MDEQ or the EPA over additional response activities;  delays in the receipt of requested permits;  delays following the receipt of any requested permits due to legal appeals of third parties;  additional or new legal or regulatory requirements; or  new or different landowner claims.
106 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Depending on the size of any indemnity obligation or liability under environmental laws, an adverse outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity and financial condition and could negatively affect CMSEnergys financial results. Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMSEnergy cannot predict the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter.
Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim: In January2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $142 million in taxes, plus interest, in connection with the sale. CMSEnergy has concluded that the governments tax claim is without merit. The government of Equatorial Guinea indicated through a request for arbitration in October2011 that it still intends to pursue its claim. CMSEnergy is vigorously contesting the claim, and cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY C ONTINGENCIES Electric Environmental Matters: Consumers operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Historically, Consumers has generally been able to recover, in customer rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations.
Cleanup and Solid Waste: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under NREPA. Consumers believes that these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers estimates that its liability for NREPA sites will be between $1 and $4 million. At December31,2011, Consumers had a recorded liability of $1million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability.
Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under the Superfund. Superfund liability is joint and several. In addition to Consumers, many other creditworthy parties with substantial assets are potentially responsible with respect to the individual sites. In November2010, Consumers received official notification from the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party at the Kalamazoo River Superfund site. The notification claimed that the EPA has reason to believe Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. Consumers responded to the EPA in December2010, stating that it has no information showing that it disposed of PCBs or arranged for disposal or treatment of PCB-containing material at portions of the site and requesting further information from the EPA before Consumers would commit to perform or finance cleanup activities at the site. In April2011, Consumers received a follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers, as a potentially responsible party at the Kalamazoo River Superfund site, agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek. The letter also indicated that under Sections 106 and 107 of Superfund, Consumers may be liable for reimbursement of the EPAs costs and potential penalties for noncompliance with any unilateral order that the EPA may issue requiring performance under the removal action plan. All parties, including Consumers, that were asked to participate in the removal action plan declined to accept liability. In August2011, the EPA announced that it would proceed with the removal action plan and would continue to pursue potentially responsible parties to perform or pay for some or all of the work. The EPA has provided limited information regarding Consumers potential responsibility for contamination at the site and has not yet given an indication of the share of any cleanup costs for which Consumers could be held responsible. Consumers continues to investigate the EPAs claim that it disposed of PCBs or arranged for disposal or treatment of PCB-containing material at portions of the site. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river.
Based on its experience, Consumers estimates that its share of the total liability for other known Superfund sites will be between $2million and $8million. Various factors, including the number of potentially responsible 107 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) parties involved with each site, affect Consumers share of the total liability. At December31,2011, Consumers had a recorded liability of $2million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable Superfund liability.
The timing of payments related to Consumers remediation and other response activities at its Superfund and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and Superfund liability.
Ludington PCB: In 1998, during routine maintenance activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers removed and replaced part of the PCB material with non-PCB material. Since proposing a plan to take action with respect to the remaining materials, Consumers has had several communications with the EPA. Consumers is not able to predict when the EPA will issue a final ruling and cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
Electric Utility Plant Air Permit Issues and Notices of Violation: In 2007, Consumers received an NOV/FOV from the EPA alleging that fourteen utility boilers exceeded the visible emission limits in their associated air permits. Consumers has responded formally to the NOV/FOV denying the allegations. In addition, in 2008, Consumers received an NOV for three of its coal-fueled facilities alleging, among other things, violations of NSR PSD regulations relating to ten projects from 1986 to 1998 allegedly subject to review under the NSR. The EPA has alleged that some utilities have classified incorrectly major plant modifications as RMRR rather than seeking permits from the EPA or state regulatory agencies to modify their plants. Consumers responded to the information requests from the EPA on this subject in the past. Consumers believes that it has properly interpreted the requirements of RMRR.
Consumers is engaged in discussions with the EPA on all of these matters. Depending upon the outcome of these discussions, the EPA could bring legal action against Consumers and/or Consumers could be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of its coal-fueled electric generating plants, surrender emission allowances, engage in Supplemental Environmental Projects, and/or pay fines. Additionally, Consumers would need to assess the viability of continuing operations at certain plants. The potential costs relating to these matters could be material and the extent of cost recovery cannot be reasonably estimated. Although Consumers cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of these matters, Consumers expects that it would be able to recover some or all of the costs in rates, consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.
Nuclear Matters: The matters discussed in this section relate to Consumers previously owned nuclear generating plants.
In 1997, a U.S.Court of Appeals decision confirmed that the DOE was to begin accepting deliveries of spent nuclear fuel for disposal by January1998. Subsequent U.S.Court of Appeals litigation, in which Consumers and other utilities participated, had not been successful in producing more specific relief for the DOEs failure to accept the spent nuclear fuel. A number of court decisions have supported the right of utilities to pursue damage claims in the U.S.Court of Claims against the DOE for failure to take delivery of spent nuclear fuel. Consumers filed a complaint in 2002.
In July2011, Consumers entered into an agreement with the DOE to settle its claims for $120million. In September2011, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC regarding the regulatory treatment of the settlement amount. For further information, see Note6, Regulatory Matters.
As part of the agreement with the DOE, Consumers settled its liability to the DOE to fund the disposal of spent nuclear fuel used at Palisades and Big Rock before 1983. This liability, which totaled $163million, 108 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) comprised $44million collected from customers for spent nuclear fuel disposal fees and $119million of interest accrued on those fees, and was to be paid no later than when the DOE began accepting delivery of spent nuclear fuel. CMSEnergy and Consumers classified the liability as long-term debt on their consolidated balance sheets.
Following the settlement, Consumers terminated its letter of credit to Entergy, which Consumers had provided as security for its retained obligation to the DOE in connection with its sale of Palisades and the Big Rock ISFSI to Entergy in 2007.
In its November2010 electric rate case order, the MPSC had directed Consumers to establish an independent trust fund for the amount payable to the DOE. Following its settlement with the DOE, Consumers petitioned the MPSC to relieve it of the obligation to fund the trust.
C ONSUMERS G AS U TILITY C ONTINGENCIES Gas Environmental Matters: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under the NREPA. These sites include 23 former MGP facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites, Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a portion of the original site.
In 2011, Consumers increased its remaining liability for these sites by $104million. The factors that contributed to this revision of estimated costs include new physical evidence regarding the extent of contamination at certain of these sites and statutory changes in Michigan that allow for the achievement of a no further action status for environmental sites. These changes led to a new plan of site-by-site remediation work necessary to achieve this status.
At December31,2011, Consumers had a recorded liability of $128million for its remaining obligations for these sites. This amount represents the present value of long-term projected costs, using a discount rate of 2.57percent and an inflation rate of 2.5percent. Consumers based the discount rate on the interest rate for 20-year U.S.Treasury securities at December31,2011. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $142million. Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs in each of the next five years as follows: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 In Millions C ONSUMERS Remediation and other response activity costs $ 14 $ 12 $ 12 $ 21 $ 13 Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability.
Pursuant to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers. At December31,2011, Consumers had a regulatory asset of $156million related to the MGP sites.
C ONSUMERS O THER C ONTINGENCIES Other Environmental Matters: Consumers is initiating preliminary investigations during 2012 at a number of potentially contaminated sites it presently owns with the intent of determining whether any contamination exists and the extent of any identified contamination. The sites to be investigated include combustion turbine sites, generating sites, compressor stations, and remote storage tanks. As of December31,2011, no contamination had been confirmed at any of these sites, but it is reasonably possible that contamination exists. Consumers is unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this stage of the investigations.

Except for items described elsewhere in this Note, CMSEnergy believes the likelihood of material loss to be remote for the indemnity obligations not recorded as liabilities.
2 At December31,2011, the carrying amount of CMSLands put option agreements with certain Bay Harbor property owners was $1million. If CMSLand is required to purchase a Bay Harbor property under a put option agreement, it may sell the property to recover the amount paid under the put option agreement.

These factors include unspecified exposure under certain agreements. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to these indemnities to be remote.
O THER C ONTINGENCIES Other: In addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and Note6, Regulatory Matters, there are certain other lawsuits and administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies arising in the ordinary course of business to which CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMSEnergy are parties. These other lawsuits and proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage, contracts, environmental matters, federal and state taxes, rates, licensing, employment, and other matters. Further, CMSEnergy and Consumers occasionally self-report certain regulatory non-compliance matters that may or may not eventually result in administrative proceedings. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that the outcome of any one of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
C ONTRACTUAL C OMMITMENTS Purchase Obligations: Presented in the following table are Consumers contractual cash obligations at December31,2011 for each of the periods shown. CMS Energy did not have any contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2011 that were not included in Consumers reported amounts.

These obligations include operating contracts used to ensure adequate supply with generating facilities that meet PURPA requirements. The commodities and services include natural gas and associated transportation, electricity, and coal and associated transportation.
The MCV PPA: Consumers has a 35-year PPA that began in 1990 with the MCV Partnership to purchase 1,240MW of electricity. The MCV PPA, as amended and restated, provides for:  a capacity charge of $10.14perMWh of available capacity;  a fixed energy charge based on Consumers annual average baseload coal generating plant operating and maintenance cost, fuel inventory, and average administrative and general expenses;  a variable energy charge for all delivered energy that reflects the MCV Partnerships cost of production;  a $5million annual contribution by the MCV Partnership to a renewable resources program; and  an option for Consumers to extend the MCV PPA for five years or purchase the MCV Facility at the conclusion of the MCV PPAs term in March2025.
111 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Capacity and energy charges under the MCV PPA were $292million in 2011, $285million in 2010, and $246million in 2009. Consumers estimates that capacity and energy charges under the MCV PPA will average $380million annually. These amounts are included in the table above.
The Palisades PPA: Consumers has a PPA expiring in 2022 with Entergy to purchase all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of 798MW. Consumers estimates that capacity and energy payments under the Palisades PPA will average $340million annually. A portion of these amounts is included in the table above. Consumers total purchases of capacity and energy under the PPA were $311million in 2011, $286million in 2010, and $276million in 2009. For further details about Palisades, see Note15, Leases.
6: REGULATORY MATTERS R ATE M ATTERS Rate matters are critical to Consumers. Depending upon the specific issues, the outcomes of rate cases and proceedings could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
C ONSUMERS E LECTRIC U TILITY Electric Rate Case: The MPSC, in its 2010 electric rate case order, authorized Consumers to increase its rates by $146million annually, $4million less than the rate increase self-implemented by Consumers in July2010. In June2011, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement, finding that no refund of self-implemented rates to customers is required.
Power Supply Cost Recovery: The PSCR process is designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR billing factor monthly in order to minimize the overrecovery or underrecovery amount in the annual PSCR reconciliation.
PSCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2011PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2010. In accordance with its proposed plan, Consumers self-implemented the 2011PSCR charge beginning in January2011. In October2011, the administrative law judge recommended that the MPSC approve Consumers 2011PSCR plan with minor modifications.
PSCR Reconciliations : Presented in the following table is the PSCR reconciliation filing pending with the MPSC: PSCRYear Date Filed NetUnderrecovery PSCRCostof Power Sold 2010 March2011 $ 15million $ 1.7billion In June2011, the MPSC issued an order approving Consumers 2009PSCR reconciliation, as modified by the order, and authorized Consumers to include an underrecovery of $31million in its 2010PSCR reconciliation.
Electric Depreciation :In November2011, the MPSC issued an order approving a settlement agreement in the electric depreciation case for Ludington, which was filed jointly by Consumers and Detroit Edison. The settlement agreement resulted in a minor decrease to annual depreciation expense effective November2011.
112 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) C ONSUMERS G AS U TILITY Gas Rate Case: In August2010, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $55million based on an 11percent authorized return on equity. The filing requested recovery for investments made to enhance safety, system reliability, and operational efficiencies that improve service to customers.
In May2011, the MPSC approved a partial settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to increase its rates by $31million annually, based on a 10.5percent authorized return on equity. Matters not addressed in the settlement agreement included the decoupling mechanism, the Smart Grid program, and contributions to the low-income and energy efficiency fund. Presented in the following table are the components of the rate increase authorized by the MPSC and the rate increase originally requested by Consumers: Components of the Rate Increase IncreaseAuthorized by the MPSC IncreaseOriginally Requested by Consumers Difference In Millions Investment in rate base $ 29 $ 30 $ (1 ) Impact of sales declines 15 4 11 Operating and maintenance costs 2 16 (14 ) Cost of capital (15 ) 5 (20 ) Total $ 31 $ 55 $ (24 ) In August2011, the MPSC authorized the continuation of the decoupling mechanism and the collection of low-income and energy efficiency funds, but denied recovery of costs associated with the Smart Grid program related to Consumers gas utility. Consumers filed a petition for rehearing in this case to address the disallowance of Smart Grid costs and stated that it would remove all costs associated with the gas Smart Grid program from its next general rate case application. In October2011, the MPSC granted Consumers petition for rehearing, allowing Consumers to recover costs that the gas utility has incurred associated with the Smart Grid program.
Gas Cost Recovery: The GCR process is designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its purchased natural gas costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its GCR billing factor monthly in order to minimize the overrecovery or underrecovery amount in the annual GCR reconciliation.
GCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2011-2012 GCR plan to the MPSC in December2010. In accordance with its proposed plan, Consumers self-implemented the 2011-2012 GCR charge beginning in April2011. In September2011, the administrative law judge recommended that the MPSC approve Consumers 2011-2012 GCR plan, with certain adjustments to its fixed-price purchase guidelines.

113 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) R EGULATORY A SSETS AND L IABILITIES Consumers is subject to the actions of the MPSC and FERC and prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of regulatory accounting. A utility must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, Consumers records regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by non-regulated businesses.

2 These regulatory assets either are included in rate base (or are expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case), thereby providing a return on expenditures, or provide a specific return on investment authorized by the MPSC.
3 These regulatory assets represent expenditures for which the MPSC has provided, or Consumers expects, recovery without a return on investment.
115 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Big Rock Nuclear Decommissioning and Related Costs and DOE Settlement: Consumers has an $85million regulatory asset recorded for $30million it paid to Entergy to assume ownership responsibility for the Big Rock ISFSI and for $55million of nuclear fuel storage costs it incurred as a result of the DOEs failure to accept nuclear fuel. Consumers had filed a complaint against the DOE in 2002 for this failure. In July2011, Consumers entered into an agreement with the DOE to settle its claims for $120million; Consumers recorded a $120million regulatory liability related to this settlement. In September2011, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC requesting authority to utilize $85million of the settlement amount as recovery of its regulatory asset, and to refund to customers $23million previously collected through rates for spent nuclear fuel costs. If the MPSC concludes that Consumers may retain any portion of the remaining $12million of the settlement amount, Consumers will recognize that amount in earnings. For further information, see Note5, Contingencies and Commitments, Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies  Nuclear Matters.
Electric and Gas Revenue Decoupling Mechanisms: The MPSCs 2009 electric rate case order authorized Consumers to implement an electric revenue decoupling mechanism, subject to certain conditions. This decoupling mechanism, which was extended through November2011 in the 2010 electric rate case order, allowed Consumers to adjust future electric rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes resulting from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average sales per customer. Various parties have filed appeals concerning the electric revenue decoupling mechanism.
In March2011, Consumers filed its first reconciliation of the electric revenue decoupling mechanism with the MPSC, requesting recovery of $27million from customers for the period December2009 through November2010. In February2012, the administrative law judge recommended that the MPSC approve Consumers reconciliation of the electric revenue decoupling mechanism for the full amount of its request for the first year of operation of the decoupling mechanism. The matter remains pending before the MPSC. The MPSC Staff and intervenors oppose this recovery.
The MPSCs 2009 gas rate case order authorized Consumers to implement a gas revenue decoupling mechanism, subject to certain conditions. This decoupling mechanism, which was extended in the 2010 gas rate case order, allows Consumers to adjust future gas rates to compensate for changes in sales volumes resulting from the difference between the level of average sales per customer adopted in the order and actual average weather-adjusted sales per customer. In September2011, Consumers filed its first reconciliation of the gas revenue decoupling mechanism with the MPSC, requesting recovery of $16million from customers for the period June2010 through May2011.
If the MPSC were to reject all or a major portion of Consumers requested recovery from its electric and gas revenue decoupling mechanisms or if the recovery period were to be substantially delayed, Consumers could be required to write off all or portions of the related regulatory assets. An unfavorable outcome in these reconciliations also could impair Consumers ability to continue recording decoupling revenue as volume deficiencies occur, rather than waiting until the recovery period.
Energy Optimization Plan: In May2011, the MPSC issued an order approving Consumers reconciliation of energy optimization plan costs for 2009. The MPSC also authorized Consumers to collect $6million from customers as an incentive payment for exceeding savings targets under both its gas and electric energy optimization plans during 2009.
In December2011, the MPSC issued an order approving Consumers reconciliation of energy optimization plan costs for 2010. The MPSC also authorized Consumers to collect $8million from customers as an incentive payment for exceeding savings targets under both its gas and electric energy optimization plans during 2010.
During 2011, Consumers achieved 138percent of its electric savings target and 129percent of its gas savings target. For achieving these savings levels, Consumers will request the MPSCs approval to collect $15million, the maximum incentive, in the energy optimization reconciliation to be filed in April2012.
116 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) As one of the conditions to the continuation of the electric and gas revenue decoupling mechanisms, Consumers must exceed the statutory savings targets for 2012 through 2015 specified in the 2008Energy Law. In August2011, Consumers filed an amended energy optimization plan with the MPSC, requesting approval of the additional spending necessary to exceed these savings targets.
At December31,2011 and 2010, surcharges collected from customers to fund Consumers energy optimization plan exceeded Consumers spending. These excess amounts are reported in the non-current portion of regulatory liabilities, as the period in which Consumers will spend the surcharges collected is beyond one year.
Uncollectible Expense Tracking Mechanism: In March2011, Consumers filed its reconciliation of the uncollectible expense tracking mechanism with the MPSC, requesting recovery of $3million from customers for November2009 through November2010, the entire period of the tracker. The uncollectible expense tracking mechanism, authorized by the MPSC in its 2009 electric rate case order, allowed future rates to be adjusted to collect or refund 80percent of the difference between the level of electric uncollectible expense included in rates and actual uncollectible expense. In November2011, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement in Consumers uncollectible expense tracking mechanism reconciliation, authorizing the recovery of $3million from customers in December2011.
Refund of Revenue in Excess of Nuclear Decommissioning Costs: The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of Consumers costs to decommission Big Rock. Subsequent to 2000, Consumers stopped funding a Big Rock trust fund because the collection period for an MPSC-authorized decommissioning surcharge expired. The level of funds provided by the trust fell short of the amount needed to complete decommissioning and Consumers provided $44million of corporate contributions for decommissioning costs.
In an order issued in February2010, the MPSC concluded that certain revenues collected during a statutory rate freeze from 2001 through 2003 should have been deposited in a decommissioning trust fund. The MPSC agreed that Consumers was entitled to recover $44million of decommissioning costs, but concluded that Consumers had collected this amount previously through the rates in effect during the rate freeze. In April2010, the MPSC ordered Consumers to refund $85million of revenue collected in excess of decommissioning costs plus interest. Consumers completed this refund in January2011. Consumers filed an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals in March2010 to dispute the MPSCs conclusion that the collections received during the rate freeze should be subject to refund. In January2012, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Consumers appeal. Consumers plans to file an appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court to dispute this decision.
Renewable Energy Plan: In 2010, Consumers filed with the MPSC its first annual report and reconciliation for its renewable energy plan, requesting approval of its plan costs for 2009. In December2011, the MPSC approved Consumers renewable energy plan reconciliation with minor modifications. Consumers filed with the MPSC its second annual report and reconciliation for its renewable energy plan in June2011, requesting approval of its plan costs for 2010.
In May2011, the MPSC issued an order approving Consumers amended renewable energy plan with minor modifications. The amended plan reduces the renewable energy surcharge by an annual amount of $54million, to $23million. The reduction is a result of lower-than-expected costs to comply with the 2008Energy Law. In October2011, Consumers filed an application for the biennial review and approval of its renewable energy plan. This filing proposes to reduce further the renewable energy surcharge by an annual amount of $3million, to $20million.
117 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) At December31,2011 and 2010, surcharges collected from customers to fund Consumers renewable energy plan exceeded Consumers spending. These excess amounts are reported in the non-current portion of regulatory liabilities, as the period in which Consumers will spend the surcharges collected is beyond one year. This regulatory liability will be amortized as costs are incurred to operate and depreciate Consumers planned wind farms and as Consumers purchases RECs under renewable energy purchase agreements. Consumers expects its first wind farm, Lake Winds Energy Park, to be operational in late 2012. Delivery of RECs under the majority of Consumers renewable energy purchase agreements is also expected to begin during 2012.

3 Obligations under this facility are secured by FMBs of Consumers.
Short-term Borrowings: Under Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program, Consumers may transfer up to $250million of accounts receivable, subject to certain eligibility requirements. These transactions 122 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) are accounted for as short-term secured borrowings. At December31,2011, $250million of accounts receivable were eligible for transfer, and no accounts receivable had been transferred under the program. During the year ended December31,2011, Consumers had no borrowings under this program.
During the year ended December31,2010, Consumers maximum short-term borrowings totaled $50million, and its average short-term borrowings totaled $1million, with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.2percent.
Contingently Convertible Securities: Presented in the following table are the significant terms of CMSEnergys contingently convertible securities at December31,2011: Security Maturity Outstanding (In Millions) Adjusted ConversionPrice Adjusted TriggerPrice 2.875% senior notes 2024 $ 226 $ 12.54 $ 15.04 5.50% senior notes 2029 172 14.08 18.31 The holders of the 2.875percent senior notes have the right to require CMSEnergy to purchase the notes at par on December1, 2014 and December1, 2019.
The securities become convertible for a calendar quarter if the price of CMSEnergys common stock remains at or above the trigger price for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous quarter. The trigger price at which these securities become convertible is 120percent of the conversion price for the 2.875percent senior notes and 130percent for the 5.5percent senior notes. The conversion and trigger prices are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including payments or distributions to CMSEnergys common stockholders. The conversion and trigger price adjustment is made when the cumulative change in conversion and trigger prices is onepercent or more. During December2011, trigger price contingencies were met for both series of the contingently convertible senior notes, and as a result, the senior notes are convertible at the option of the security holders for the three months ending March31,2012.
All of CMSEnergys contingently convertible securities, if converted, require CMSEnergy to pay cash up to the principal amount of the securities. For the 2.875percent senior notes, any conversion value in excess of the principal amount is paid in shares of CMSEnergys common stock. For the 5.50percent senior notes, any conversion value in excess of the principal amount can be paid in cash or in shares of CMSEnergys common stock, at the election of CMSEnergy.

Dividend Restrictions: Under provisions of CMSEnergys senior notes indenture, at December31,2011, payment of common stock dividends by CMSEnergy was limited to $1.2billion.
123 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at December31,2011, Consumers had $493million of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay common stock dividends to CMSEnergy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that under a variety of circumstances common stock dividends from Consumers would not be limited to amounts in Consumers retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay common stock dividends in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would result only after a formal regulatory filing process.
For the year ended December31,2011, CMSEnergy received $374million of common stock dividends from Consumers.
Capitalization: The authorized capital stock of CMSEnergy consists of:  350millionshares of CMSEnergy Common Stock, par value $0.01per share, and  10millionshares of CMSEnergy Preferred Stock, par value $0.01per share.
Issuance of Common Stock: On June15,2011, CMSEnergy entered into a continuous equity offering program under which CMSEnergy may sell, from time to time in at the market offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $50million. In June2011, under this program, CMSEnergy issued 762,925shares of common stock at an average price of $19.66pershare, resulting in net proceeds of $15million.

S TOCK O PTIONS AND W ARRANTS For the year ended December31,2011, outstanding options to purchase 0.1millionshares of CMSEnergy common stock had no impact on diluted EPS, since the exercise price was greater than the average market price of CMSEnergy common stock. These stock options have the potential to dilute EPS in the future.
N ON - VESTED S TOCK A WARDS CMSEnergys non-vested stock awards are composed of participating and non-participating securities. The participating securities accrue cash dividends when common stockholders receive dividends. Since the recipient is not required to return the dividends to CMSEnergy if the recipient forfeits the award, the non-vested stock awards are considered participating securities. As such, the participating non-vested stock awards were included in the computation of basic EPS. The non-participating securities accrue stock dividends that vest concurrently with the stock award. If the recipient forfeits the award, the stock dividends accrued on the non-participating securities are also forfeited. Accordingly, the non-participating awards and stock dividends were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but not basic EPS.

3 Includes current portion of long-term debt of $339million at December31,2011 and $37million at December31,2010.
Notes receivable consist of EnerBanks fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank estimates the fair value of these loans using a discounted cash flows technique that incorporates market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining life of the loans and credit risk. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flows or underlying collateral values.
CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of their long-term debt using quoted prices from market trades of the debt, if available. In the absence of quoted prices, CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate market yields and prices for the debt using a matrix method that incorporates market data for similarly rated debt. Depending on the information available, other valuation techniques may be used that rely on internal assumptions and models. CMSEnergy includes the value of the conversion features in estimating the fair value of its convertible debt, and incorporates, as appropriate, information on the market prices of CMSEnergy common stock.
126 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) The effects of third-party credit enhancements are excluded from the fair value measurements of long-term debt. At December31,2011 and 2010, CMSEnergys long-term debt included $103million principal amount that was supported by third-party credit enhancements. This entire principal amount was at Consumers.

The contributions were used to acquire additional shares in the mutual funds. State and municipal bonds classified as available for sale consisted of investment grade state and municipal bonds. Debt securities classified as held to maturity consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities held by EnerBank, as well as state and municipal bonds held by EnerBank.

Realized losses on these sales were less than $1million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers during each period.
In 2011, CMSEnergy and Consumers sold their SERP investments in state and municipal bonds. The proceeds were reinvested in a mutual fund that holds fixed-income instruments of varying maturities. The activity during 2009 related primarily to the sale of a SERP investment in a mutual fund.
10: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS In order to limit exposure to certain market risks, primarily changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates, CMSEnergy and Consumers may enter into various risk management contracts, such as forward contracts, futures, options, and swaps. The contracts used to manage market risks may qualify as derivative instruments. Neither CMSEnergy nor Consumers enters into any derivatives for trading purposes.
Commodity Price Risk : In order to support ongoing operations, CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into contracts for the future purchase and sale of various commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, and coal. These forward contracts are generally long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of the commodity at a contracted price. Most of these contracts are not subject to derivative accounting because:  they do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units specified in a derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity or bcf of natural gas);  they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception; or  there is not an active market for the commodity.
Consumers coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is not an active market for the coal it purchases. If an active market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts may qualify as derivatives. Since Consumers is subject to regulatory accounting, the resulting fair value gains and losses would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and would not affect net income.
Consumers also uses FTRs to manage price risk related to electricity transmission congestion. An FTR is a financial instrument that entitles its holder to receive compensation or requires its holder to remit payment for congestion-related transmission charges. FTRs are accounted for as derivatives. Under regulatory accounting, all changes in fair value associated with these instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities until the instruments are settled.
CMSERM has not designated its contracts to purchase and sell electricity and natural gas as normal purchases and sales and, therefore, CMSEnergy accounts for those contracts as derivatives.
The fair value of CMSEnergys commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments and recorded in other assets were $3 million at December31, 2011 and $1 million at December31, 2010. The fair value of Consumers commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments and recorded in other assets were $2 million at December31, 2011 and $1 million at December31, 2010. The fair value of CMSEnergys commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments and recorded in other liabilities were $7 million at December31, 2011 and $4 million at December31, 2010. Consumers did not have any contracts recorded as liabilities at December31, 2011 and 2010.

11: NOTES RECEIVABLE EnerBank provides unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. These loans totaled $480million, net of an allowance for loan losses of $5million, at December31,2011, and $386million, net of an allowance for loan losses of $5million, at December31,2010. At December31,2011, $19million of EnerBanks loans were classified as current notes receivable and $461million were classified as non-current notes receivable on CMSEnergys consolidated balance sheets. At December31,2010, $11million of EnerBanks loans were classified as current notes receivable and $375million were classified as non-current notes receivable on CMSEnergys consolidated balance sheets.
The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to reflect estimated credit losses. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance required by taking into consideration historical loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the loss is confirmed, but no later than the point at which a loan becomes 120days past due.

The ABO for the EISP for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, was $5million at December31,2011 and 2010. The ABO for the EISP for Consumers was $1million at December31,2011 and 2010.
OPEB : Participants in the OPEB plan include all regular full-time employees covered by the employee health care plan on the day before retirement from either CMSEnergy or Consumers at age 55 or older with at least ten full years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees who qualify for Pension Plan 131 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) disability retirement and have 15years of applicable continuous service may also participate in the OPEB plan. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption that costs would increase 7.5percent in 2012 and 8.0percent in 2011 for all retirees. The rate of increase was assumed to decline to fivepercent for all retirees by 2017 and thereafter.
The assumptions used in the health care cost-trend rate affect service, interest, and PBO costs. Presented in the following table are the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the health care cost-trend assumption: OnePercentage PointIncrease OnePercentage PointDecrease In Millions CMSE NERGY , INCLUDING C ONSUMERS Effect on total service and interest cost component $ 19 $ (16 ) Effect on PBO 245 (213 ) C ONSUMERS Effect on total service and interest cost component $ 18 $ (15 ) Effect on PBO 238 (207 ) Assumptions : Presented in the following tables are the weighted-average assumptions used in CMSEnergys and Consumers retirement benefits plans to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost: Pension and SERP OPEB December31 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 CMSE NERGY , INCLUDING C ONSUMERS Weighted Average for Benefit Obligations : Discount rate 1 4.90 % 5.40 % 5.85 % 5.10 % 5.60 % 6.00 % Mortality table 2 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 Rate of compensation increase Pension 3.50 % 4.00 % 4.00 % SERP 5.50 % 5.50 % 5.50 % Weighted Average for Net Periodic Benefit Cost: Discount rate 1 5.40 % 5.85 % 6.50 % 5.60 % 6.00 % 6.50 % Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 3 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.25 % 7.50 % 7.50 % 7.75 % Mortality table 2 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 Rate of compensation increase Pension 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % SERP 5.50 % 5.50 % 5.50 % 1 The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from a yield curve analysis. This analysis incorporated the projected benefit payments specific to CMSEnergys and Consumers Pension Plan and OPEB plan and the yields on high quality corporate bonds rated Aa or better.
2 The mortality assumption was based on the RP-2000 mortality tables with projection of future mortality improvements using ScaleAA, which aligned with the IRS prescriptions for cash funding valuations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006.
132 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 3 CMSEnergy and Consumers determined the long-term rate of return using historical market returns, the present and expected future economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with financial market knowledge. CMSEnergy and Consumers considered the asset allocation of the portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of the portfolio. The goal was to determine a long-term rate of return that could be incorporated into the planning of future cash flow requirements in conjunction with the change in the liability. Annually, CMSEnergy and Consumers review for reasonableness and appropriateness the forecasted returns for various classes of assets used to construct an expected return model. CMSEnergys and Consumers expected long-term rate of return on Pension Plan assets was eightpercent in 2011. The actual return on Pension Plan assets was fourpercent in 2011, 13percent in 2010, and 21percent in 2009.

These regulatory adjustments were offset by surcharge revenues, which resulted in no impact to net income for the years presented. The pension and OPEB regulatory liability was less than $1million at December31,2011 and 2010.
For CMSEnergy, the estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit Pension Plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 from the regulatory asset is $79million and from AOCI is $2million. For Consumers, the estimated net loss and prior service cost for the defined benefit Pension Plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 from the regulatory asset is $79million. For CMS Energy, the estimated net loss and prior service credit for OPEB plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 from the regulatory asset is $33million, with a decrease from AOCI of $1million. For Consumers, the estimated net loss and prior service credit for OPEB plans that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 from the regulatory asset is $33million.
CMSEnergy and Consumers amortize net gains and losses in excess of tenpercent of the greater of the PBO or the MRV over the average remaining service period. The estimated period of amortization of gains and losses for CMSEnergy and Consumers was 11years for pension and 13years for OPEB for the year ended December31,2011, and 12years for pension and 14years for OPEB for each of the years ended 134 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) December31,2010 and 2009. Prior service cost amortization is established in the year in which the prior service cost first occurred, and is based on the same amortization period for all future years until the prior service costs are fully amortized. CMS Energy and Consumers had new prior services credits for OPEB in 2010. The estimated period of amortization of these new prior service credits for CMSEnergy and Consumers was tenyears for OPEB for the year ended December31,2010.

2 CMSEnergy, including Consumers, does not plan to contribute to the Pension Plan in 2012.
Contributions include required and discretionary amounts. Actual future contributions will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, and various factors related to the populations participating in the plans.
In 2011, CMSEnergy reached its target asset allocation for Pension Plan assets of 50percent equity, 30percent fixed income, and 20percent alternative-strategy investments. This target asset allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&P MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers as well as high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are diversified across absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset allocation. CMSEnergy and Consumers use annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocation.
CMSEnergy and Consumers established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund their future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries. CMSEnergy and Consumers have a target asset allocation of 60percent equity and 40percent fixed-income investments.
CMSEnergy and Consumers invest the equity portions of the union and non-union health care VEBA trusts in an S&P500 Index fund.

In May2011, Michigan enacted the MCIT, effective January1,2012. The MCIT, a simplified sixpercent corporate income tax, will replace the MBT, which is a complex multi-part business tax. Both the MBT and the MCIT are income taxes for financial reporting purposes, for which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded. CMSEnergy and Consumers remeasured their Michigan deferred income tax assets and liabilities at June30,2011 to reflect this change in law. Unlike the MBT, the MCIT does not allow future tax deductions to offset the book-tax differences that existed upon enactment of the tax. Due primarily to the elimination of these future tax deductions, Consumers has eliminated $128million of net deferred tax assets associated with its utility book-tax temporary differences, recognizing a $128million regulatory asset (not including 144 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) the effects of income tax gross-ups), and in addition to the amounts related to Consumers, CMSEnergy eliminated $32million of net deferred tax liabilities associated with its non-utility book-tax temporary differences, recognizing a $32million deferred income tax benefit.
2 For the year ended December31,2010, CMSEnergy recognized deferred tax expense of $3million to reflect the enactment of the Health Care Acts. The law change prospectively repealed the tax deduction for the portion of the health care costs reimbursed by the Medicare PartD subsidy for taxable years beginning after December31,2012. Consumers has recorded a regulatory asset of $98million at December31,2011 to reflect the expected recovery of additional future income taxes.

Consumers has provided a valuation allowance of $1million for the state capital loss carryforward. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to utilize fully tax loss and credit carryforwards for which no valuation has been provided. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments will be made to the valuation allowances within one year.
Presented in the following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax benefits: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 In Millions CMSE NERGY , INCLUDING C ONSUMERS Balance at beginning of period $ 4 $ 62 $ 65 Reductions for prior year tax positions (1 ) (58 ) (6 ) Additions for prior year tax positions 1  2 Additions for current year tax positions   1 Balance at end of period $ 4 $ 4 $ 62 C ONSUMERS Balance at beginning of period $ 3 $ 57 $ 55 Reductions for prior year tax positions  (54 ) (1 ) Additions for prior year tax positions 1  2 Additions for current year tax positions   1 Balance at end of period $ 4 $ 3 $ 57 147 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) CMSEnergy, including Consumers, had uncertain tax benefits of $4million at December31,2011 and 2010 and $8million at December31,2009 that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate in future years. Consumers had uncertain tax benefits of $4million at December31,2011 and $3million at December31,2010 and 2009 that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate in future years.
CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and penalties, where applicable, as part of income tax expense. CMSEnergy, including Consumers, recognized no interest for the year ended December31,2011 and less than $1million for each of the years ended December31,2010 and 2009. In 2010, CMSEnergy settled with the IRS and, as a result, paid $6million of accrued interest in December2010. At that time, a remaining accrued interest balance of $3million was eliminated. Consumers recognized no interest for the year ended December31,2011 and less than $1million for each of the years ended December31,2010 and 2009. Upon settlement with the IRS in 2010, Consumers paid $4million to CMSEnergy and eliminated a remaining accrued interest balance of $1million.
In November2010, the IRS concluded its audit of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries, and proposed changes of $132million to taxable income for the years ended December31,2002 through December31,2007. Of this amount, $82million resulted in an adjustment to the existing net operating loss carryforward; the remaining $50million increased taxable income. Most of the adjustments related to the timing of deductions, not the disallowance of deductions. CMSEnergy accepted the proposed adjustments to taxable income, which resulted in the payment of $15million of tax and accrued interest. The tax adjustments were allocated based on the companies separate taxable income, in accordance with CMSEnergys tax sharing agreement. The impact to net income was less than $1million.
In December2010, the IRS began its audit of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries 2008 and 2009 federal tax returns. The IRS also is auditing CMSEnergys research and development tax credit claims for 2001 through 2009. These credits are part of CMSEnergys overall general business credit carryforwards. It is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, a settlement will be reached with the IRS on CMSEnergys research and development tax credit claim. The total claimed credit for these years is $21million.
The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. CMSEnergys and Consumers estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that their accrued tax liabilities at December31,2011 were adequate for all years.
14: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CMSEnergy and Consumers provide a PISP to key employees and non-employee directors based on their contributions to the successful management of the company. The PISP has a five-year term, expiring in May2014.
All grants under the PISP for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were in the form of TSR restricted stock and time-lapse restricted stock. Restricted stock recipients receive shares of CMSEnergy common stock. Restricted stock shares granted prior to August1,2010 have full dividend and voting rights. The TSR restricted stock shares granted after August1,2010 continue to have full voting rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, however, the TSR restricted stock shares granted after August1,2010 receive additional restricted shares equal to the value of the dividend. These additional restricted shares are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying restricted stock shares.
148 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) TSR restricted stock vesting is contingent on meeting a three-year service requirement and a specific market condition. The market condition is based entirely on a comparison of CMSEnergys TSR with the median TSR of a peer group over the same three-year period. Depending on the outcome of the market condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero to 200percent of the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock vests after a service period of three years.
Restricted stock awards granted to officers in 2011 were 75percent TSR restricted stock and 25percent time-lapsed restricted stock. Awards granted to officers in 2010 and 2009 were 67percent TSR restricted stock and 33percent time-lapse restricted stock.
For awards granted prior to August1,2010, restricted shares may vest fully upon retirement, disability, or change of control of CMSEnergy if certain minimum service requirements are met or are waived by action of the C&HR Committees. If employment terminates for any other reason (other than death) or the minimum service requirements are not met or waived, the restricted shares will be fully forfeited. For awards granted after August1,2010, a pro-rata portion of the award equal to the portion of the service period served between the award grant date and the employees termination date will vest upon termination of an employee due to retirement, disability, or change of control of CMSEnergy. For TSR awards, this vesting is contingent upon the outcome of the market condition. The remaining portion of the award will be forfeited. All awards vest fully upon death.
The PISP also allows for stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, performance units, and incentive options, none of which was granted in 2011, 2010, or 2009.
Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or performance units may not exceed 6million shares from June2009 through May2014, nor may such awards to any recipient exceed 500,000shares in any fiscal year. CMSEnergy and Consumers may issue awards of up to 3,884,919shares of common stock under the PISP at December31,2011. Shares for which payment or exercise is in cash, as well as shares or stock options forfeited for any reason other than failure to meet a market condition, may be awarded or granted again under the PISP.

During 2011, Consumers granted 295,035 TSR shares, 207,613 time-lapse shares, 23,328 shares from dividends paid on TSR shares, and 211,528 shares granted as a result of the outcome of the TSR awards market condition.
CMSEnergy and Consumers charge the fair value of the awards to expense over the required service period. As a result, for awards granted prior to August1,2010, CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize all compensation expense for share-based awards that have accelerated service provisions upon retirement by the period in which the employee becomes eligible to retire. TSR restricted stock awards granted after August1,2010 have graded vesting features, and CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize expense for those awards on a graded vesting schedule over the required service period. Expense for time-lapse awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period. CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate the fair value of time-lapse restricted stock based on the price of CMSEnergys common stock on the grant date. CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate the fair value of TSR restricted stock awards on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMSEnergy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMSEnergy common stock.
The risk-free rate for each valuation was based on the three-year U.S.Treasury yield at the award grant date. Presented in the following table are the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the TSR restricted stock awards: 2011 2010 2009 Expected volatility 29.6 % 30.1 % 29.8 % Expected dividend yield 4.6 % 2.4 % 2.0 % Risk-free rate 1.0 % 0.9 % 1.8 % 150 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Presented in the following table are amounts related to restricted stock awards: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 InMillions CMSE NERGY , INCLUDING C ONSUMERS Fair value of shares that vested during the year $ 7 $ 7 $ 4 Compensation expense recognized 10 9 9 Income tax benefit recognized 4 4 3 C ONSUMERS Fair value of shares that vested during the year $ 7 $ 6 $ 4 Compensation expense recognized 10 9 8 Income tax benefit recognized 4 3 3 At December31,2011, $10million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, and $10million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for Consumers. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 2.0years.

Stock options are exercisable upon grant, and expire up to tenyears and one month from the grant date. CMSEnergy and Consumers issue new shares when recipients exercise stock options. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for CMSEnergy was $1million for each of the years ended December31,2011 and 2010 and less than $1million for the year ended December31,2009. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for Consumers was $1million for each of the years ended December31,2011 and 2010 and less than $1million for the year ended December31,2009. Cash received from exercise of these stock options in 2011 was $2million for CMSEnergy and $1million for Consumers.
151 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Since CMSEnergy has utilized tax loss carryforwards, CMSEnergy was unable to realize excess tax benefits upon exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, CMSEnergy did not recognize the related excess tax benefits in equity. As of December31,2011, CMSEnergy has $31million of unrealized excess tax benefits.

In addition, CMSEnergy and Consumers account for a number of their PPAs as capital and operating leases.
Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have lease terms expiring without extension provisions over the next 12years and with extension provisions over the next 15years. These leases contain fair market value extension and buyout provisions, with some providing for predetermined extension period rentals. Capital leases for Consumers vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of 120months with some having Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause end-of-life provisions and others having fixed percentage purchase options.
Consumers has capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the Karn generating complex and Zeeland. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the Karn generating complex has a term of 15years with a provision to extend the contract from month to month. The remaining term of the contract was 10years at December31,2011. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline to Zeeland has a term of 12years with a renewal provision at the end of the contract. The remaining term of the contract was oneyear at December31,2011. The remaining terms of Consumers long-term PPAs range between one and 20years. Most of these PPAs contain provisions at the end of the initial contract terms to renew the agreements annually.
Consumers is authorized by the MPSC to record operating lease payments as operating expense and recover the total cost from customers. Presented in the following table are Consumers operating lease expense and contingent rental expense. For each of the years ended December31,2011, 2010, and 2009, all of CMSEnergys operating lease expense and contingent rental expense were attributable to Consumers.

Consumers has continuing involvement with Palisades through security provided to Entergy for Consumers PPA obligation and other arrangements. Because of these ongoing arrangements, Consumers accounted for the transaction as a financing of Palisades and not a sale. Accordingly, no gain on the sale of Palisades was recognized on the consolidated statements of income. Consumers accounted for the remaining non-real-estate assets and liabilities associated with the transaction as a sale.
Palisades remains on Consumers consolidated balance sheets and Consumers continues to depreciate it. Consumers recorded the related proceeds as a finance obligation with payments recorded to interest expense and the finance obligation based on the amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades PPA. The value of the finance obligation was determined based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair values of the net assets sold and fair value of the plant asset under the financing. Total amortization and interest charges under the financing were $21million, $22million, and $23 million, respectively, for the years ended December31,2011, 2010, and 2009.

155 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Presented in the following table is further detail on CMSEnergys and Consumers accumulated depreciation and amortization: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 In Millions CMSE NERGY , INCLUDING C ONSUMERS Utility plant assets $ 4,844 $ 4,592 Non-utility plant assets 57 54 C ONSUMERS Utility plant assets $ 4,844 $ 4,592 Non-utility plant assets 2 1 Maintenance and Depreciation: CMSEnergy and Consumers record property repairs and minor property replacement as maintenance expense. CMSEnergy and Consumers record planned major maintenance activities as operating expense unless the cost represents the acquisition of additional long-lived assets or the replacement of an existing long-lived asset.
Consumers depreciates utility property on an asset-group basis, in which it applies a single MPSC-approved depreciation rate to the gross investment in a particular class of property within the electric and gas segments. Consumers performs depreciation studies periodically to determine appropriate group lives. Presented in the following table are the composite depreciation rates for Consumers segment properties: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Electric utility property 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.0 % Gas utility property 2.9 % 2.9 % 2.9 % Other property 7.4 % 7.4 % 7.6 % CMSEnergy and Consumers record plant, property, and equipment at original cost when placed into service. The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, overhead such as pension and other benefits, and AFUDC, if applicable. Consumers plant, property, and equipment is generally recoverable through its general rate making process. For additional details see Note6, Regulatory Matters.
When utility property is mothballed, the property is reserved for future use, stays in rate base, and continues to be depreciated at the same rate as before the mothball period. No changes are made to rates unless it is decided that the units will be retired, or the MPSC disallows some or all costs associated with the property.
When utility property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal, net of salvage. CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. Consumers records cost of removal collected from customers, but not spent, as a regulatory liability.
Consumers capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction projects, except pollution control facilities on its fossil-fueled power plants. AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and authorized return-on-equity funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers records the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed funds component and as other income for the equity funds component on the consolidated statements of income. When construction is completed and the property is placed in service, 156 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Consumers depreciates and recovers the capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of the related asset. Presented in the following table are Consumers composite AFUDC capitalization rates: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 AFUDC capitalization rate 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.6 % CMSEnergy and Consumers capitalize the purchase and development of internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed evenly over the estimated useful life of the internal-use computer software. If computer software is integral to computer hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the hardware. The types of costs capitalized are consistent for all periods presented by the financial statements.
Intangible Assets : Included in net plant, property, and equipment are intangible assets.

Consumers shares operation, maintenance, and other expenses of these jointly owned utility facilities in proportion to each participants undivided ownership interest. Consumers is required to provide only its share of financing for the jointly owned utility facilities.
17: ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS CMSEnergy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. No market risk premiums were included in CMSEnergys and Consumers ARO fair value estimates since reasonable estimates could not be made. If a fivepercent market risk premium were assumed, CMSEnergys and Consumers ARO liabilities at December31,2011 would increase by $13million and at December31,2010 would increase by $12million.
If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMSEnergy and Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.

An entity is considered to be a VIE when its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors, as a group, lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest.
Entities that are VIEs must be consolidated if the reporting entity determines that it has a controlling financial interest. The entity that is required to consolidate the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1)the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (2)the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Effective January1,2010, new guidance changed the criteria for consolidating VIEs. As a result of adopting this guidance, CMSEnergy consolidated CMSEnergy Trust I and deconsolidated three partnerships that it had previously consolidated.
CMSEnergy has consolidated CMSEnergy TrustI because CMSEnergy is the variable interest holder that designed the entity and, through the design, has the power to direct the activities of CMSEnergy TrustI that most significantly impact the trusts economic performance. The sole assets of the trust consist of subordinated notes issued by CMSEnergy, and the sole liabilities of the trust consist of Trust Preferred Securities. CMSEnergy has guaranteed payment of the Trust Preferred Securities. Upon consolidation, CMSEnergy reduced its equity method investment by $5million and its long-term debt by $34million. CMSEnergy also recorded a $29million liability for the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities issued by the trust. No gain or loss was recognized on the consolidation of CMSEnergy TrustI. The balance of the Trust Preferred Securities was $29million at December31,2011. In January2012, CMS Energy called all of the securities, to be redeemed in late February2012.
CMSEnergy has variable interests in T.E.S.Filer City, Grayling, and Genesee. CMSEnergy is not the primary beneficiary of any of these partnerships because power is shared among unrelated parties, and no one party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance. The partners must agree on all major decisions for each of the partnerships.
160 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Presented in the following table is information about these partnerships: Name (Ownership Interest) Nature of the Entity Financing of Partnership T.E.S.Filer City (50%) Coal-fueled power generator Non-recourse long-term debt that matured in December2007.
Grayling (50%) Wood waste-fueled power generator Sale of revenue bonds that mature in November2012 and bear interest at variable rates. The debt is recourse to the partnership, but not the individual partners, and secured by a letter of credit equal to the outstanding balance.
Genesee (50%) Wood waste-fueled power generator Sale of revenue bonds that mature in 2021 and bear interest at fixed rates. The debt is non-recourse to the partnership and secured by a CMSEnergy guarantee capped at $3million annually.
CMSEnergy has operating and management contracts with Grayling and Genesee, and Consumers is the primary purchaser of power from each partnership through long-term PPAs. Consumers also has reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee, which allow these facilities to be dispatched based on the market price of wood waste. This results in fuel cost savings that each partnership shares with Consumers customers.
CMSEnergys investment in these partnerships is included in investments on its consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $52million as of December31,2011 and $49million as of December31,2010. The creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the general credit of CMSEnergy or Consumers, except through a guarantee provided by CMSEnergy of $3million annually. CMSEnergy has deferred collections on certain receivables owed by Genesee. CMSEnergys maximum exposure to loss from these receivables is $6million. Consumers has not provided any financial or other support during the periods presented that was not previously contractually required.
19: RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS  CONSUMERS Consumers enters into a number of significant transactions with related parties. These transactions include:  purchase and sale of electricity from and to affiliates of CMSEnterprises;  payment of parent company overhead costs to CMSEnergy; and  investment in CMSEnergy common stock.
Transactions involving power supply purchases from certain affiliates of CMSEnterprises are based on avoided costs under PURPA, state law, and competitive bidding. The payment of parent company overhead costs is based on the use of accepted industry allocation methodologies. These payments are for costs that occur in the normal course of business.
Presented in the following table are Consumers recorded income and expense from related parties as of December31: Description Related Party 2011 2010 2009 In Millions Purchases of capacity and energy Affiliates of CMSEnterprises $ 81 $ 84 $ 81 161 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Amounts payable to related parties for purchased power and other services were $11million at December31,2011 and 2010.
Consumers owned 1.6million shares of CMSEnergy common stock with a fair value of $35million at December31,2011. For additional details on Consumers investment in CMSEnergy common stock, see Note9, Financial Instruments.
20: ASSET SALES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES A SSET S ALES The impacts of asset sales are included in gain on asset sales, net and income (loss) from discontinued operations on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income, and they are included in loss (gain) on asset sales, net on Consumers consolidated statements of income. Asset sales for CMSEnergy and Consumers were less than $1million for each of the years ended December31,2011 and 2009.
In 2010, CMSEnterprises exercised its option to sell its stock interest in CMSGeneration San Nicolas Company and transferred the sale proceeds to MEI. As a result, CMSEnterprises recognized a $3million net gain. In 2010, CMSEnterprises also sold a cost-method investment with a carrying value of zero, and recognized a $3million gain.
D ISCONTINUED O PERATIONS Discontinued operations are a component of the enterprises segment. CMSEnergy included the following amounts in income (loss) from discontinued operations: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 In Millions Revenues $  $ 10 $ 7 Discontinued operations Pretax income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 2 $ (21 ) $ 33 Income tax expense  2 13 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax expense $ 2 1 $ (23 ) 2 $ 20 3 1 Includes an operating gain of $3million related to a litigation settlement at CMSViron.
2 Includes an operating loss of $2million ($1million net of tax) at Exeter, whose assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale in 2009.
Also includes disposal-related losses of $10million in additional tax expense resulting from an IRS audit adjustment related to a 2003 asset sale, a $6million ($4million net of tax) loss for the write down of CMSEnergys investment in Exeter, a $5million ($3million net of tax) loss for the increase in a liability for a 2007 asset sale, and a $5million ($3million net of tax) loss on the settlement of a 2002 asset sale indemnity.
3 Includes an operating loss of $11million ($7million net of tax) at Exeter and a loss of $3million ($2million net of tax) related to a litigation settlement at CMSViron.
Also includes a gain for the expiration of an indemnity obligation related to a 2007 asset sale. CMSEnergy provided an indemnity to TAQA in connection with the sale of its ownership interests in businesses in the Middle East, Africa, and India, and recorded a $50million provision for the contingent liability. This indemnity expired in 2009 and CMSEnergy eliminated the liability from its consolidated balance sheets, 162 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) recognizing a $45million benefit ($28million net of tax) to income (loss) from discontinued operations and a $5million benefit to gain on asset sales, net.
Discontinued operations include a provision for closing costs and a portion of CMSEnergys parent company interest expense. The amount of interest expense allocated by CMSEnergy was less than $1million in each of 2011, 2010, and 2009. CMSEnergy allocates its interest expense by applying its total interest expense to the net carrying amount of the asset sold divided by CMSEnergys total capitalization.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, CMSEnergys management committed to a plan to sell its interest in Exeter and initiated an active program to locate potential buyers. CMSEnergy completed the sale of this business in January2011. Presented in the following table are the major classes of assets and liabilities of Exeter classified as held for sale on CMSEnergys consolidated balance sheet at December31,2010: Year Ended December31 2010 InMillions Assets Current Assets: Cash $ 1 Accounts receivable, net 1 Non-current Assets: Plant, property, and equipment, net 3 Other 1 Total assets $ 6 Liabilities: Current Liabilities $ 1 Total liabilities $ 1 I MPAIRMENT C HARGES In 2010, CMSEnergy wrote down its investment in Exeter from its carrying amount of $11million to Exeters fair value of $5million. This valuation was based on the price that CMSEnergy received for the sale of Exeter, which closed in January2011. The impairment resulted in a loss of $6million, which was recorded in earnings as part of discontinued operations for the year ended December31,2010.
In May2010, Consumers announced plans to defer the development of its proposed 830-MW coal-fueled plant at its Karn/Weadock generating complex. At that time, Consumers recorded a charge of $3million to write off certain capitalized development costs because the costs were deemed not to have long-term value in connection with the potential future construction of the plant. The projects air permit, issued by the MDEQ in December2009, was set to expire in August2011 if construction of the coal plant had not commenced or if Consumers had not been granted an extension of the air permit. In December2010, Consumers determined that it would not begin construction before August2011 as a means of preserving the air permit. As a result, the likelihood that the plant would be constructed had diminished significantly. In December2010, in accordance with accounting standards governing impairment of plant costs for regulated utilities, Consumers recorded an additional charge of $19million to write off the remaining previously capitalized development costs associated with the proposed plant. The total charge of $22million was recorded in other operating expenses for the year ended December31,2010. In December2011, Consumers announced the cancellation of the proposed plant.
163 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) CMSEnergy and Consumers recorded no other impairments of long-lived assets for the years ended December31,2011, 2010, and 2009.
21: REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Reportable segments consist of business units defined by the products and services they offer. CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate the performance of each segment based on its contribution to net income available to CMSEnergys common stockholders. The reportable segments for CMSEnergy and Consumers are: CMSEnergy:  electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan;  gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in Michigan;  enterprises, consisting of various subsidiaries engaging primarily in domestic independent power production; and  other, including EnerBank, corporate interest and other expenses, and discontinued operations.
Consumers:  electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation and distribution of electricity in Michigan;  gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in Michigan; and  other, including a consolidated special-purpose entity for the sale of accounts receivable.
Accounting policies for CMSEnergys and Consumers segments are as described in Note1, Significant Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the individual segments when appropriate. Accounts are allocated among the segments when common accounts are attributable to more than one segment. The allocations are based on certain measures of business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers, other operation and maintenance expense, construction expense, leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For example, customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.
Inter-segment sales and transfers are accounted for at current market prices and are eliminated in consolidated net income available to common stockholders by segment.

169 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CMS Energy Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows, and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CMS Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item15(a)(2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES CMSEnergy Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMSEnergy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMSEnergys CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31,2011.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: CMSEnergys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). CMSEnergys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of CMSEnergy;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMSEnergy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of CMSEnergy; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of CMSEnergys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMSEnergy conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2011. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, CMSEnergys management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,2011. The effectiveness of CMSEnergys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item8.
