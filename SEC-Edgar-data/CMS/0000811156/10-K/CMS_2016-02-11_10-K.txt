13 Table of Contents PartI Item1. Business GENERAL CMSEnergy CMSEnergy was formed as a corporation in Michigan in 1987 and is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers serves individuals and businesses operating in the alternative energy, automotive, chemical, metal, and food products industries, as well as a diversified group of other industries. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged primarily in independent power production and owns power generation facilities fueled mostly by natural gas and biomass.
CMSEnergy manages its businesses by the nature of services each provides, and operates principally in three business segments: electric utility, gas utility, and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers consolidated operations account for the substantial majority of CMSEnergys total assets, income, and operating revenue. CMSEnergys consolidated operating revenue was $6.5billion in 2015, $7.2billion in 2014, and $6.6billion in 2013.
For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to all of CMSEnergys business segments and operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataCMSEnergys Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consumers Consumers has served Michigan customers since 1886. Consumers was incorporated in Maine in 1910 and became a Michigan corporation in 1968. Consumers owns and operates electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and gas transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. It provides electricity and/or natural gas to 6.7million of Michigans 10million residents. Consumers rates and certain other aspects of its business are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC and FERC, as well as to NERC reliability standards, as described in CMSEnergy and Consumers Regulation in this Item1.
Consumers consolidated operating revenue was $6.2billion in 2015, $6.8billion in 2014, and $6.3billion in 2013. For further information about operating revenue, income, and assets and liabilities attributable to Consumers electric and gas utility operations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataConsumers Selected Financial Information, Consolidated Financial Statements, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

BusinessBusiness SegmentsConsumers Electric UtilityElectric Utility Properties and Consumers Gas UtilityGas Utility Properties.
14 Table of Contents In2015, Consumers served 1.8million electric customers and 1.7million gas customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula. Presented in the following map are Consumers service territories: BUSINESS SEGMENTS Consumers Electric Utility Electric Utility Operations: Consumers electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $4.2billion in 2015, $4.4billion in 2014, and $4.2billion in 2013. Consumers electric utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
15 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2015 electric utility operating revenue of $4.2billion by customer class: Consumers electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
In 2015, Consumers electric deliveries were 37billionkWh, which included ROA deliveries of fourbillionkWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 33billionkWh. In 2014, Consumers electric deliveries were 38billionkWh, which included ROA deliveries of fourbillionkWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34billionkWh.
Consumers electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.
16 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2015 and 2014: Consumers 2015 summer peak demand was 7,812MW, which included ROA demand of 581MW. For the 2014-2015 winter period, Consumers peak demand was 6,067MW, which included ROA demand of 492MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term PPAs and short-term capacity purchases, essentially all of the capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2016.
Electric Utility Properties: Consumers distribution system consists of:  434miles of high-voltage distribution radial lines operating at 120kilovolts or above  4,251miles of high-voltage distribution overhead lines operating at 46kilovolts and 69kilovolts  18miles of high-voltage distribution underground lines operating at 46kilovolts  56,023miles of electric distribution overhead lines  10,383miles of underground distribution lines  substations with an aggregate transformer capacity of 24millionkVA Consumers is interconnected to the interstate high-voltage electric transmission system owned by METC and operated by MISO. Consumers is also interconnected to neighboring utilities and to other transmission systems.

As shown in the following illustration, Consumers 2015 generation capacity of 8,762MW, including purchased capacity of 2,877MW, relied on a variety of fuel sources: 19 Table of Contents Electric Utility Supply: Presented in the following table are the sources of Consumers electric supply over the last fiveyears: GWh Years Ended   December31 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 Owned   generation Coal 15,833 15,684 15,951 14,027 15,468 Gas 3,601 2,012 1,415 3,003 1,912 Renewable energy 1,056 748 704 433 425 Oil - - 4 6 7 Net pumped   storage 1 (186 ) (300 ) (371 ) (295 ) (365 ) Total owned   generation 20,304 18,144 17,703 17,174 17,447 Purchased   and interchange power Purchased   renewable energy 2 2,163 2,366 2,250 1,435 1,587 Purchased   generation  other 2 11,720 10,073 10,871 13,104 11,087 Net interchange   power 3 1,327 4,793 3,656 4,151 6,825 Total purchased   and interchange power 15,210 17,232 16,777 18,690 19,499 Total supply 35,514 35,376 34,480 35,864 36,946 1 Represents Consumers share of net pumped-storage generation. The pumped-storage facility consumes electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate electricity later during peak-demand hours.
2 Includes purchases from long-term PPAs.
3 Includes purchases from the MISO energy market.
During 2015, 45percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned ninemillion tons of coal and produced a combined total of 15,833GWh of electricity.
In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December31,2015, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through 2018; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $118million. Most of Consumers rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. Consumers vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation. At December31,2015, Consumers had 79percent of its 2016 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 34-day supply of coal on hand.
In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of rail cars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers generating facilities. Consumers coal transportation contracts expire through 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $321million at December31,2015.
During 2015, Consumers acquired 43percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers needs during peak demand periods.
At December31,2015, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which, in accordance with GAAP, liabilities have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants availability or deliverability. The payments for 2016 through 2036 are 20 Table of Contents estimated to total $10billion and, for each of the next fiveyears, $1.0billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&ACapital Resources and Liquidity and Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsContractual Commitments.
During 2015, tenpercent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by natural gas-fueled generating units, which burned 25bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 3,601GWh of electricity.
In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For units 3 and 4 of D.E.Karn and for the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities. For its smaller combustion turbines, Consumers electric utility purchases and transports gas to its facilities as a bundled-rate tariff customer of either the gas utility or DTEGas.
Presented in the following table is the cost permillion Btu of all fuels consumed, which fluctuates with the mix of fuel used.
Cost Per Million Btu Years Ended   December31 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 Coal $ 2.49 $ 2.72 $ 2.90 $ 2.98 $ 2.94 Gas 3.06 7.19 4.68 3.16 4.95 Oil 12.28 20.16 19.47 19.08 18.55 Weighted-average   fuel cost $ 2.59 $ 3.17 $ 3.07 $ 3.05 $ 3.18 Electric Utility Competition: Consumers electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.
The 2008Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December31,2015, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 751MW of generation service to ROA customers. Of Consumers 1.8million electric customers, 304customers, or 0.02percent, purchased generation service under the ROA program.
In early 2015, members of the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives introduced various bills related to energy policy. Among other things, the bills propose a range of changes to ROA, including eliminating ROA, maintaining the existing ROA program but imposing conditions on a customers return to utility service, and raising the ROA limit. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations. Presently, the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives are considering two separate but similar pieces of legislation to address energy policy, including ROA. Consumers is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.
Consumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with:  industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers service territory for economic reasons  municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems  customer self-generation 21 Table of Contents Consumers addresses this competition by monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas, by providing non-energy services and value to customers through Consumers rates and service, and by offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development.
Consumers Gas Utility Gas Utility Operations: Consumers gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $1.9billion in 2015, $2.4billion in 2014, and $2.1billion in 2013. Consumers gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2015 gas utility operating revenue of $1.9billion by customer class: Consumers gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
In 2015, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 356bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 57bcf. In 2014, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 373bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 65bcf. Consumers gas utility operations are seasonal. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months when the demand for natural gas is higher. Peak demand occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. During 2015, 42percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.
22 Table of Contents Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2015 and 2014: Gas Utility Properties: Consumers gas transmission, storage, and distribution system consists of:  1,686miles of transmission lines  15gas storage fields with a total storage capacity of 309bcf and a working gas volume of 151bcf  27,537miles of distribution mains  sevencompressor stations with a total of 157,939installed and available horsepower 23 Table of Contents Gas Utility Supply: In 2015, Consumers purchased 69percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and fivepercent from Canadian producers. The remaining 26percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2015: Firm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts are with ANR Pipeline Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, and Trunkline Gas Company,LLC, each a non-affiliated company. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts expire through 2023 and provide for the delivery of 47percent of Consumers total gas supply requirements in 2016. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.
Gas Utility Competition: Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers gas utility business. Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.
Enterprises SegmentNon-Utility Operations and Investments CMSEnergys enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged primarily in domestic independent power production and the marketing of independent power production. The enterprises segments operating revenue was $190million in 2015, $299million in 2014, and $181million in 2013.
24 Table of Contents Independent Power Production: At December31,2015, CMSEnergy had ownership interests in independent power plants totaling 1,177MW or 1,077netMW. (Net MW reflects that portion of the capacity relating to CMSEnergys ownership interests.) Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys interests in independent power plants at December31,2015: Ownership Primary Gross Capacity 1 2015   NetGeneration Location Interest (%) Fuel Type (MW) (GWh) Dearborn,   Michigan 100 Natural gas 752 2 3,399 Gaylord,   Michigan 100 Natural gas 156 4 Comstock,   Michigan 100 Natural gas 68  Filer City,   Michigan 50 Coal and biomass 73 505 New Bern, North   Carolina 50 Biomass 50 369 Flint, Michigan 50 Biomass 40 71 Grayling,   Michigan 50 Biomass 38 122 Total 1,177 4,470 1 Represents the intended full-load sustained output of each plant.
2 In December2015, capital upgrades and modifications to the plants turbines increased gross capacity from 710MW to 752MW.
The operating revenue from independent power production was $17million in 2015, $18million in 2014, and $17million in 2013. CMSEnergys independent power production business faces competition from generators, marketers and brokers, and utilities marketing power in the wholesale market.
Energy Resource Management: CMSERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMSEnergys generating facilities with a focus on optimizing CMSEnergys independent power production portfolio. In 2015, CMSERM marketed eightbcf of natural gas and 4,579GWh of electricity. Electricity marketed by CMSERM was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment and by unrelated third parties. CMSERMs operating revenue was $173million in 2015, $281million in 2014, and $164million in 2013.
Other Businesses EnerBank: EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBanks operating revenue was $101million in 2015, $80million in 2014, and $64million in 2013.
CMSENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local governmental agencies, including those described in the following sections.
FERC and NERC FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMSEnterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMSERM, CMSGas Transmission, and DIG. FERCs jurisdiction includes, among other things, acquisitions, operations, disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates charged, and conduct among affiliates. FERC also has limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMSEnergy. FERC, in connection with NERC and with regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation and 25 Table of Contents transmission owners and operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system.
FERC regulates limited aspects of Consumers gas business, principally compliance with FERC capacity release rules, shipping rules, the prohibition against certain buy/sell transactions, and the price-reporting rule.
FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale and transmission rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.
MPSC Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, certain asset transfers, corporate mergers, and other matters.
The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders.
Rate Proceedings: For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlook and Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote3, Regulatory Matters.
Other Regulation The U.S.Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the DOEs Office of Fossil Fuels.
The U.S.Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.
EnerBank is regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC.
Energy Legislation CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various legislative-driven matters, including Michigans 2008Energy Law. This law requires that at least tenpercent of Consumers electric sales volume come from renewable energy sources. It also allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. For additional information regarding Consumers renewable energy plan and electric ROA, see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlook.
CMSENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE CMSEnergy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations for environmental quality, including air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. Consumers expects to recover costs to comply with environmental regulations in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item1A. Risk Factors and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated 26 Table of Contents Financial StatementsNote4, Contingencies and Commitments and Note11, Asset Retirement Obligations.
CMSEnergy has recorded a $58million liability for its subsidiaries obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded a $114million liability for its obligations at a number of MGP sites. For additional information, see Item1A. Risk Factors and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Air: Consumers continues to install state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $84million from 2016 through 2020 to comply with present and future federal and state environmental regulations that will require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. Consumers estimate may increase if additional or more stringent laws or regulations are adopted, including regulations regarding greenhouse gases.
Solid Waste Disposal: Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Consumers solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigans solid waste rules. In April2015, the EPA published a final ruleregulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The final ruleadopts minimum standards for beneficially reusing and disposing of non-hazardous CCRs. The ruleestablishes new minimum requirements for site location, groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust control, and public disclosure of information. The rulealso sets out conditions under which CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR and non-CCR waste and initiate closure based on the inability to achieve minimum safety standards, meet a location standard, or meet minimum groundwater standards. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems to minimize applicable requirements. In addition, all of Consumers ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ inspections. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital and cost of removal expenditures to comply with regulations relating to ash disposal is $243million from 2016 through 2020.
Water: Consumers uses substantial amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA issued final regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2015. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $69million from 2016 through 2020.
In 2014, the EPA finalized its cooling water intake rule, which requires Consumers to evaluate the biological impact of its cooling water intake systems and ensure that it is using the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $58million from 2016 through 2020.
For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to air, solid waste disposal, and water see Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and UncertaintiesElectric Environmental Outlook.
INSURANCE CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMSEnergy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMSEnergy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMSEnergy or Consumers 27 Table of Contents renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.
CMSEnergys and Consumers present insurance program does not cover the risks of certain environmental costs, such as the cleanup of sites owned by CMSEnergy or Consumers, or claims for the long-term storage or disposal of pollutants or for air pollution.

Item1A. Risk Factors Actual results in future periods for CMSEnergy and Consumers could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following sections. CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that involve uncertainties that may materially affect results, and that are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that management believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect CMSEnergy or Consumers. The risk factors described in the following sections, as well as the other information included in this report and in other documents filed with the SEC, should be considered carefully before making an investment in securities of CMSEnergy or Consumers. Risk factors of Consumers are also risk factors of CMSEnergy. All of these risk factors are potentially significant.
CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.
Due to its holding company structure, CMSEnergy depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other payment obligations. If sufficient dividends were not paid to CMSEnergy by its subsidiaries, CMSEnergy might not be able to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity and financial condition.
Consumers ability to pay dividends or acquire its own stock from CMSEnergy is limited by restrictions contained in Consumers preferred stock provisions and potentially by other legal restrictions, such as certain terms in its articles of incorporation and FERC requirements.
30 Table of Contents CMSEnergy has indebtedness that could limit its financial flexibility and its ability to meet its debt service obligations.
The level of CMSEnergys present and future indebtedness could have several important effects on its future operations, including, among others, that:  a significant portion of CMSEnergys cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes  covenants contained in CMSEnergys existing debt arrangements, which require it to meet certain financial tests, could affect its flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in its business  CMSEnergys ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and other purposes could become limited  CMSEnergy could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that are less leveraged  CMSEnergys vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions could increase  CMSEnergys future credit ratings could fluctuate CMSEnergys ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, changes in laws or regulatory decisions, and financial, business, and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. CMSEnergy cannot make assurances that its businesses will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness. If CMSEnergy were unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, it could be required to sell assets or obtain additional financing.
CMSEnergy and Consumers have financing needs and could be unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers may be subject to liquidity demands under commercial commitments, guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other contingent liabilities. Consumers capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years as it invests in the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, conversions and expansions, and other electric and gas infrastructure to upgrade delivery systems. Those requirements may increase if additional laws or regulations are adopted or implemented.
CMSEnergy and Consumers rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as on bank syndications, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if sufficient internal funds are not available from Consumers operations and, in the case of CMSEnergy, from dividends paid by Consumers and its other subsidiaries. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use letters of credit issued under certain of their revolving credit facilities to support certain operations and investments.
Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect CMSEnergys and Consumers access to liquidity needed for their businesses. Consumers inability to obtain prior FERC authorization for any securities issuances, including publicly offered debt, as is required under the Federal Power Act, could adversely affect Consumers access to liquidity. Any liquidity disruption could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to take measures to conserve cash. These measures could include, but are not limited to, deferring capital expenditures, changing CMSEnergys and Consumers commodity purchasing strategy to avoid collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments, or other discretionary uses of cash.
31 Table of Contents CMSEnergy continues to explore financing opportunities to supplement its financial strategy. These potential opportunities include refinancing and/or issuing new debt, preferred stock and/or common equity, commercial paper, and bank financing. Similarly, Consumers may seek funds through the capital markets, commercial lenders, and leasing arrangements. Entering into new financings is subject in part to capital market receptivity to utility industry securities in general and to CMSEnergys and Consumers securities in particular. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee the capital markets acceptance of their securities or predict the impact of factors beyond their control, such as actions of rating agencies.
Certain of CMSEnergys and Consumers securities and those of their affiliates are rated by various credit rating agencies. Any reduction or withdrawal of one or more of its credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys or Consumers ability to access capital on acceptable terms and maintain commodity lines of credit, could increase its cost of borrowing, and could cause CMSEnergy or Consumers to reduce capital expenditures. If it were unable to maintain commodity lines of credit, CMSEnergy or Consumers might have to post collateral or make prepayments to certain suppliers under existing contracts. Further, since Consumers provides dividends to CMSEnergy, any adverse developments affecting Consumers that result in a lowering of its credit ratings could have an adverse effect on CMSEnergys credit ratings. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot guarantee that any of their present ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.
If CMSEnergy or Consumers were unable to obtain bank financing or access the capital markets to incur or refinance indebtedness, or were unable to obtain commercially reasonable terms for any financing, this could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
There are risks associated with Consumers substantial capital investment program planned for the next fiveyears.
Consumers planned investments include the Smart Energy program, construction or acquisition of power generation, gas infrastructure, conversions and expansions, environmental controls, decommissioning of older facilities, and other electric and gas investments to upgrade delivery systems. The success of these capital investments depends on or could be affected by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:  effective pre-acquisition evaluation of asset values, future operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors beyond Consumers control  effective cost and schedule management of new capital projects  availability of qualified construction personnel  changes in commodity and other prices  governmental approvals and permitting  operational performance  changes in environmental, legislative, and regulatory requirements  regulatory cost recovery It is possible that adverse events associated with these factors could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Changes to ROA could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
The 2008Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales of the preceding calendar year. Lower natural gas prices due to a large supply of natural gas on the market, coupled with low capacity prices in the electric supply market, are 32 Table of Contents placing increasing competitive pressure on the cost of Consumers electric supply. Presently, Consumers electric rates are above the Midwest average, while the ROA level on Consumers system is at the ten-percent limit and the proportion of Consumers electric deliveries under the ROA program and on the ROA waiting list is 25percent. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation, which could have an adverse effect on financial results.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to rate regulation. Consumers electric and gas retail rates are set by the MPSC and cannot be increased without regulatory authorization. Consumers is permitted by the 2008 Energy Law to self-implement rate changes six months after a rate filing with the MPSC, subject to certain limitations. If Consumers self-implements rates that result in higher revenues than would have resulted from rates that the MPSC authorizes in its final order, Consumers must refund the difference, with interest. Also, the MPSC may delay or deny implementation of a rate increase upon showing of good cause.
In addition, if rate regulators fail to provide timely rate relief, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers or Consumers plans for making significant capital investments could be materially adversely affected. Regulators seeking to avoid or minimize rate increases could resist raising customer rates sufficiently to permit Consumers to recover the full cost of these investments. In addition, because there are statutory requirements mandating that regulators must allow Consumers to recover from customers certain costs, such as resource additions to meet Michigans renewable resource standard, energy optimization, and environmental compliance, regulators could be more inclined to oppose rate increases for other requested items and investments. Rate regulators could also face pressure to avoid or limit rate increases for a number of reasons, including an economic downturn in the state or diminishment of Consumers customer base. In addition to its potential effects on Consumers investment program, any limitation of cost recovery through rates could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Orders of the MPSC could limit recovery of costs of providing service including, but not limited to, environmental and safety related expenditures for coal-fueled plants and other utility properties, regulatory assets, power supply and natural gas supply costs, operating and maintenance expenses, additional utility-based investments, sunk investment in mothballed or retired generating plants, costs associated with the proposed retirement and decommissioning of facilities, depreciation expense, MISO energy and transmission costs, costs associated with energy efficiency investments and state or federally mandated renewable resource standards, Smart Energy program costs, or expenditures subject to tracking mechanisms. These orders could also result in adverse regulatory treatment of other matters. For example, MPSC orders could prevent or curtail Consumers from shutting off non-paying customers, could prevent or curtail Consumers from self-implementing rate changes, could prevent or curtail the implementation of a gas revenue mechanism, or could require Consumers to refund previously self-implemented rates.
FERC authorizes certain subsidiaries of CMSEnergy to sell electricity at market-based rates. Failure of these subsidiaries to maintain this FERC authority could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Transmission rates are also set by FERC. FERC orders related to transmission costs could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
The various risks associated with the MPSC and FERC regulation of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, which include the risk of adverse decisions in any number of rate or regulatory proceedings before either agency, as well as judicial proceedings challenging any agency decisions, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, investment plans, and results of operations.
33 Table of Contents Utility regulation, state or federal legislation, and compliance could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to, or affected by, extensive utility regulation and state and federal legislation. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. If it were determined that they failed to comply, CMSEnergy or Consumers could become subject to fines or penalties or be required to implement additional compliance, cleanup, and remediation programs, the cost of which could be material. Adoption of new laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices by federal or state agencies, or changes to present laws, rules, regulations, principles, or practices and the interpretation of any adoption or change, could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, any state or federal legislation concerning CMSEnergys or Consumers operations could have a similar effect.
Utility regulation could be impacted by various matters, such as electric industry restructuring, hydro relicensing, asset reclassification, gas pipeline capacity and gas storage, new generation facilities or investments, environmental controls, climate change, air emissions, renewable energy, energy policy and ROA, regulation or deregulation, energy capacity standards or markets, reliability, and safety. CMSEnergy and Consumers cannot predict the impact of these matters on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental requirements.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to costly and stringent environmental regulations and expect that environmental laws and regulations will continue to become more stringent and require additional significant capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and CERCLA, will continue to have a material effect on CMSEnergy and Consumers.
In 2015, 95percent of the energy generated by Consumers came from fossil-fuel-fired power plants, with 77percent coming from coal-fueled power plants. CMSEnterprises also has interests in fossil-fuel-fired power plants and other types of power plants that produce greenhouse gases. In October2015, the EPA published rulespursuant to Section111(d)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rulesthe Clean Power Plan. The rulesrequire a 32percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). Federal environmental laws and rulesand international accords and treaties could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to install additional equipment for emission controls, purchase carbon emissions allowances, curtail operations, invest in generating capacity with fewer carbon dioxide emissions, or take other significant steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases.
The following risks related to climate change, emissions, and environmental regulations could also have a material adverse impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations:  litigation originated by third parties against CMSEnergy, Consumers, or their subsidiaries due to CMSEnergys or Consumers greenhouse gas or other emissions or CCR disposal and storage  impairment of CMSEnergys or Consumers reputation due to their greenhouse gas or other emissions and public perception of their response to potential environmental regulations, rules, and legislation  extreme weather conditions, such as severe storms, that may affect customer demand, company operations, or assets 34 Table of Contents Consumers plans to retire seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units by April2016. Once the facilities and equipment on these sites are taken out of service, Consumers may encounter previously unknown environmental conditions that will need to be addressed in a timely fashion with state and federal environmental regulators.
Consumers expects to collect fully from its customers, through the ratemaking process, expenditures incurred to comply with environmental regulations, but cannot guarantee this outcome. If Consumers were unable to recover these expenditures from customers in rates, it could negatively affect CMSEnergys and/or Consumers liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition and CMSEnergy and/or Consumers could be required to seek significant additional financing to fund these expenditures.
For additional information regarding compliance with environmental regulations, see Item1. BusinessCMSEnergy and Consumers Environmental Compliance and Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMD&AOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses could be affected adversely by any delay in meeting environmental requirements.
A delay or failure by CMSEnergy or Consumers to obtain or maintain any necessary environmental permits or approvals to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements or install emission control equipment could:  prevent the construction of new facilities  prevent the continued operation and sale of energy from existing facilities  prevent the suspension of operations at existing facilities  prevent the modification of existing facilities  result in significant additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to incur additional substantial costs related to remediation of legacy environmental sites.
Consumers expects to incur additional substantial costs related to the remediation of its former MGP sites. Based upon prior MPSC orders, Consumers expects to be able to recover the costs of these cleanup activities through its gas rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.
Consumers also expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of other sites under NREPA and CERCLA. Consumers believes these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome.
In addition, CMSEnergy retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection, treatment, and discharge of leachate at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. CMSEnergy has signed agreements with the EPA and the MDEQ relating to Bay Harbor. If CMSEnergy were unable to meet its commitments under these agreements, or if unanticipated events occurred, CMSEnergy could incur additional material costs relating to its Bay Harbor remediation obligations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could be affected adversely by legacy litigation and retained liabilities.
CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas,Inc., and Cantera Gas Company were named as defendants in various lawsuits arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price 35 Table of Contents reporting. Allegations include price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CMSEnergy cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or the amount of damages for which CMSEnergy may be liable. It is possible that the outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
The agreements that CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into for the sale of assets customarily include provisions whereby they are required to:  retain specified preexisting liabilities, such as for taxes, pensions, or environmental conditions  indemnify the buyers against specified risks, including the inaccuracy of representations and warranties that CMSEnergy and Consumers make  make payments to the buyers depending on the outcome of post-closing adjustments, litigation, audits, or other reviews, including claims resulting from attempts by foreign or domestic governments to assess taxes on past operations or transactions Many of these contingent liabilities can remain open for extended periods of time after the sales are closed. Depending on the extent to which the buyers might ultimately seek to enforce their rights under these contractual provisions, and the resolution of any disputes concerning them, there could be a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys or Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $152million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale. The matter is proceeding to formal arbitration. CMSEnergy is contesting the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers energy sales and operations are affected by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year to year.
CMSEnergys and Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. Accordingly, CMSEnergys and Consumers overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and winter heating season as well as the impact of extreme weather events on Consumers system could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Consumers is exposed to risks related to general economic conditions in its service territories.
Consumers electric and gas utility businesses are affected by the economic conditions impacting the customers they serve. If the Michigan economy becomes sluggish or declines, Consumers could experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, economic conditions in Consumers service territory affect its collections of accounts receivable and levels of lost or stolen gas, which in turn impact its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
36 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to information security risks, risks of unauthorized access to their systems, and technology failures.
In the regular course of business, CMSEnergy and Consumers handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to laws and rulesissued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of CMSEnergys and Consumers information or control systems could involve theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, such as confidential customer information or, separately, system operating information. These events could disrupt operations, subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to possible financial liability, damage their reputation and diminish the confidence of customers, and have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial conditions, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, technology systems are vulnerable to being disabled, failures, cyber crime, and unauthorized access. These events could impact the reliability of electric generation and electric and gas delivery and also subject CMSEnergy and Consumers to financial harm. Cyber crime, which includes the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for disruption or unauthorized access against companies, including CMSEnergy and Consumers, has increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. While CMSEnergy and Consumers have not been subject to cyber crime incidents that have had a material impact on their operations to date, their security measures in place may be insufficient to prevent a major cyber incident in the future. If technology systems were to fail or be breached, CMSEnergy and Consumers might not be able to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and proprietary data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, because CMSEnergys and Consumers generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect CMSEnergys or Consumers businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.
A variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support critical functions. The failure of these technologies, or the inability of CMSEnergy and Consumers to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses have liability risks.
Consumers electric and gas delivery systems, power plants, gas infrastructure including storage facilities, wind energy or solar equipment, energy products, and the independent power plants owned in whole or in part by CMSEnergy could be involved in incidents, failures, or accidents that result in injury, loss of life, or property loss to customers, employees, or the public. Although CMSEnergy and Consumers have insurance coverage for many potential incidents (subject to deductibles and self-insurance amounts that could be material), depending upon the nature or severity of any incident, failure, or accident, CMSEnergy or Consumers could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, and negative repercussions from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.
CMSEnergys and Consumers revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond their control, including but not limited to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and related acts of war, cyber incidents, vandalism, and other catastrophic events.
The impact of natural disasters, severe weather, wars, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber incidents, pandemics, and other catastrophic events on the facilities and operations of CMSEnergy and Consumers 37 Table of Contents could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could result in severe damage to CMSEnergys and Consumers assets beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, could require CMSEnergy and Consumers to incur significant upfront costs, and could severely disrupt operations, resulting in loss of service to customers. There is also a risk that regulators could, after the fact, conclude that Consumers preparedness or response to such an event was inadequate and take adverse actions as a result.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to significant reputational risks.
CMSEnergy and Consumers could suffer negative impacts to their reputations as a result of operational incidents, violations of corporate policies, regulatory violations, inappropriate use of social media, or other events. Reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also result in negative customer perception and increased regulatory oversight.
Consumers is exposed to changes in customer usage that could impact financial results.
Distributed electricity generation: Technology advances and government incentives and subsidies could increase the cost effectiveness of customer-owned methods of producing electricity, such as fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar photovoltaics, resulting in reduced load, cross subsidization, and increased costs. This could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Energy efficiency: Customers could reduce their consumption through demand-side energy conservation and energy efficiency programs. These reductions could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Energy risk management strategies might not be effective in managing fuel and electricity pricing risks, which could result in unanticipated liabilities to CMSEnergy and Consumers or increased volatility in their earnings.
Consumers is exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas, coal, electric capacity, electric energy, emission allowances, gasoline, diesel fuel, and RECs. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose Consumers to price risk. A substantial portion of Consumers operating expenses for its electric generating plants and vehicle fleet consists of the costs of obtaining these commodities. The contracts associated with Consumers fuel and purchased power costs are executed in conjunction with the PSCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers manages commodity price risk using established policies and procedures, and it may use various contracts to manage this risk, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. No assurance can be made that these strategies will be successful in managing Consumers pricing risk or that they will not result in net liabilities to Consumers as a result of future volatility in these markets.
Natural gas prices in particular have been historically volatile. Consumers routinely enters into contracts to mitigate exposure to the risks of demand, market effects of weather, and changes in commodity prices associated with its gas distribution business. These contracts are executed in conjunction with the GCR mechanism, which is designed to allow Consumers to recover prudently incurred costs associated with those positions. If the MPSC determined that any of these contracts or related contracting policies were imprudent, recovery of these costs could be disallowed. Consumers does not always hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility. Furthermore, the ability to hedge exposure to commodity price volatility depends on liquid commodity markets. As a result, to the extent the commodity markets are illiquid, Consumers might not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in larger unhedged positions than preferred at a given time. To the extent that 38 Table of Contents unhedged positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in laws that limit Consumers ability to hedge could also have a negative effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to counterparty risk.
Adverse economic conditions or financial difficulties experienced by counterparties with whom CMSEnergy and Consumers do business could impair the ability of these counterparties to pay for CMSEnergys and Consumers services and/or fulfill their contractual obligations, including performance and payment of damages. CMSEnergy and Consumers depend on these counterparties to remit payments and perform contracted services in a timely fashion. Any delay or default in payment or performance of contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Volatility and disruptions in capital and credit markets could have a negative impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers lenders, vendors, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other counterparties, causing them to fail to meet their obligations. Adverse economic conditions could also have a negative impact on the loan portfolio of CMSEnergys banking subsidiary, EnerBank.
Consumers might not be able to obtain an adequate supply of natural gas or coal, which could limit its ability to operate its electric generation facilities or serve its natural gas customers.
Consumers has natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts in place for the natural gas and coal it requires for its electric generating capacity. Consumers also has interstate transportation and supply agreements in place to facilitate delivery of natural gas to its customers. Apart from the contractual and monetary remedies available to Consumers in the event of a counterpartys failure to perform under any of these contracts, there can be no assurances that the counterparties to these contracts will fulfill their obligations to provide natural gas or coal to Consumers. The counterparties under the agreements could experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to Consumers. In addition, counterparties under these contracts might not be required to supply natural gas or coal to Consumers under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather.
If, for its electric generating capacity, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas or coal requirements under existing or future natural gas and coal supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas or coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generating resources in the MISO energy market. If, for natural gas delivery to its customers, Consumers were unable to obtain its natural gas supply requirements under existing or future natural gas supply and transportation contracts, it could be required to purchase natural gas at higher prices from other sources or implement its natural gas curtailment program filed with the MPSC. These alternatives could increase Consumers working capital requirements and could decrease its revenues.
Market performance and other changes could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets, which then could require substantial funding.
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under CMSEnergys and Consumers pension and postretirement benefit plans. CMSEnergy and Consumers have significant obligations under these plans and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below CMSEnergys and Consumers forecasted return rates. A decline in the market value of the assets or a change in the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels could significantly increase the funding requirements of these obligations. Also, changes in demographics, including an increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, could 39 Table of Contents significantly increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and postretirement benefit plans. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to manage their pension and postretirement plan assets successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
A work interruption or other union actions could adversely affect Consumers.
Over 40percent of Consumers employees are represented by unions. In 2015, both of Consumers unions, representing all union employees, ratified three separate five-year agreements, expiring in 2020. If these employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, Consumers could experience a significant disruption in its operations and higher ongoing labor costs.
Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations.
The workforce of CMSEnergy and Consumers is aging and a number of employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to match skill sets to future needs, they could encounter operating challenges and increased costs. These challenges could include a lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and delays in skill development. Additionally, higher costs could result from the use of contractors to replace employees, loss of productivity, and safety incidents. Failing to train replacement employees adequately and to transfer internal knowledge and expertise could adversely affect CMSEnergys and Consumers ability to manage and operate their businesses. If CMSEnergy and Consumers were unable to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their financial condition and results of operations could be affected negatively.
Unplanned power plant outages could be costly for Consumers.
Unforeseen maintenance of Consumers power plants may be required for many reasons, including catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, extreme weather, floods or other acts of God, equipment failure, operator error, or the need to comply with environmental or safety regulations. When unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, Consumers will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that exceed Consumers costs of generation or be forced to retire a given unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. Additionally, unplanned maintenance work could reduce the capacity credit Consumers receives from MISO and could cause Consumers to incur additional capacity costs in future years. If Consumers were unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact CMSEnergy and Consumers.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use taxes, employment-related taxes, and ongoing issues related to these tax matters. The judgments include determining reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and may be subject to challenge by the IRS and/or other taxing authorities. Unfavorable settlements of any of the issues related to these reserves or other tax matters at CMSEnergy or Consumers could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
CMSEnergy and Consumers are subject to changing tax laws. Increases in federal, state, or local tax rates or other changes in tax laws could have adverse impacts on their liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
40 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers and EnerBank, must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its related regulations, which are subject to change and could involve material costs or affect operations.
Regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are still being adopted by the appropriate agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section13 to the Bank Holding Company Act. Known as the Volcker Rule, it generally restricts certain banking entities (such as EnerBank) and their subsidiaries or affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The statutory effective date of the Volcker Rulewas July2012, but it is subject to certain transition periods and exceptions for permitted activities. In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board issued final regulations clarifying that banks and other financial institutions had until 2015 to conform fully their activities and investments to the requirements. In December2014, the Federal Reserve Board issued an order extending to July2016 the date by which banking entities must comply with the Volcker Rules prohibition on owning interests in covered funds and further indicated its intention to grant another extension, in December2015, of the covered funds deadline to July2017. Under the statute, the activities of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries (including EnerBank) are not expected to be materially affected; however, they will be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third-party hedge or private equity funds, and sponsoring these funds in the future unless CMSEnergy qualifies for an exemption from the rule. CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain ongoing compliance requirements pursuant to the regulations. CMSEnergy cannot predict the full impact of the Volcker Ruleon CMSEnergys or EnerBanks operations or financial condition.
Effective July2011, all companies that directly or indirectly control an FDIC-insured bank are required to serve as a source of financial strength for that institution. As a result, CMSEnergy could be called upon by the FDIC to infuse additional capital into EnerBank to the extent that EnerBank fails to satisfy its capital requirements. In addition, CMSEnergy is contractually required (i)to make cash capital contributions to EnerBank in the event that EnerBank does not maintain required minimum capital ratios and (ii)to provide EnerBank financial support, in an amount and duration as may be necessary for EnerBank to meet the cash needs of its depositors and other operations. EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeds them as of February2016.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of certain commodity-related contracts. Although CMSEnergy, Consumers, and CMSERM qualify for an end-user exception from mandatory clearing of commodity-related swaps, these regulations could affect the ability of these entities to participate in these markets and could add additional regulatory oversight over their contracting activities.

47 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This MD&A is a combined report of CMSEnergy and Consumers.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW CMSEnergy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMSEnterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMSEnterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, owns and operates power generation facilities.
CMSEnergy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMSEnergy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility.
CMSEnergy and Consumers earn revenue and generate cash from operations by providing electric and natural gas utility services; electric distribution, transmission, and generation; gas transmission, storage, and distribution; and other energy-related services. Their businesses are affected primarily by:  regulation and regulatory matters  economic conditions  weather  energy commodity prices  interest rates  CMSEnergys and Consumers securities credit ratings CMSEnergys and Consumers business strategy emphasizes the key elements depicted below: 48 Table of Contents Accountability is part of CMSEnergys and Consumers corporate culture. CMSEnergy and Consumers are committed to making the right choices to serve their customers safely and affordably and to acting responsibly as corporate citizens. CMSEnergy and Consumers hold themselves accountable to the highest standards of safety, operational performance, and ethical behavior, and work diligently to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations that govern the electric and gas industry. Consumers 2015 Accountability Report, which is available to the public, provides an overview of Consumers efforts to continue meeting Michigans energy needs safely and efficiently, and highlights Consumers commitment to Michigan businesses, its corporate citizenship, and its role in reducing the states air emissions.
Safe, Excellent Operations The safety of employees, customers, and the general public remains a priority of CMSEnergy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMSEnergy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. In 2015, Consumers reduced recordable safety incidents by 29percent compared with 2014. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2015 was the lowest in Consumers history.
Customer Value Consumers is undertaking a number of initiatives that reflect its intensified customer focus. Consumers planned investments in reliability are aimed at improving safety, reducing customer outage frequency, reducing repetitive outages, and increasing customer satisfaction. In 2015, Consumers attained reductions in the duration of electric customer outages and in the frequency of forced outages of its electric generation facilities. Consumers intensified customer focus has led to measureable improvements in customer satisfaction.
Also, in order to minimize increases in customer base rates, Consumers has undertaken several additional initiatives to reduce costs. These include accelerated pension funding, employee and retiree health care cost sharing, replacement of coal-fueled generation with more efficient gas-fueled generation, targeted infrastructure investment, including the installation of smart meters, negotiated labor agreements, information and control system efficiencies, and productivity improvements. In addition, Consumers gas commodity costs have declined by 64percent over the last ten years, due in part to Consumers improvements to its gas infrastructure and optimization of its gas purchasing and storage strategy. These savings are all passed on to customers.
Utility Investment Consumers investment program focuses on projects that will enhance customer value. During 2015, Consumers completed the purchase of a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant located in Jackson, Michigan for $155million. Anticipating the planned retirement of seven coal-fueled electric generating units by April2016, Consumers acquired the natural gas-fueled plant to help address its future capacity requirements and to provide customers with a reliable, cost-effective, and cleaner source of electricity.
Consumers expects to make capital investments of about $17billion from 2016 through 2025. While Consumers has substantially more investment opportunities that would add customer value, Consumers has limited its capital investment program to those investments it believes are needed to provide safe, reliable, and efficient service to its customers. Consumers capital investment program is expected to result in annual rate-base growth of five to sevenpercent while allowing Consumers to maintain sustainable customer base rate increases (excluding PSCR and GCR charges) at or below the rate of inflation.
49 Table of Contents Over the next five years, Consumers expects to make capital investments of about $8.4billion, as presented in the following illustration: Consumers planned base capital investments of $4.1billion represent projects to maintain Consumers system and comprise $2.5billion at the electric utility to preserve reliability and capacity and $1.6billion at the gas utility to sustain deliverability and enhance pipeline integrity. An additional $2.7billion of planned reliability investments at Consumers are aimed at reducing outages and improving customer satisfaction; these investments comprise $1.6billion at the gas utility to replace mains and enhance transmission and storage systems and $1.1billion at the electric utility to strengthen circuits and substations and replace poles. Consumers also expects to spend $0.7billion on environmental investments needed to comply with state and federal laws and regulations.
Consumers Smart Energy program also represents a major capital investment. The full-scale deployment of advanced metering infrastructure began in 2012 and is planned to continue through 2017. Consumers has spent $0.5billion through 2015 on its Smart Energy program, and expects to spend an additional $0.3billion, following a phased approach, from 2016 through 2017.
Regulation Regulatory matters are a key aspect of CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses, particularly Consumers rate cases and regulatory proceedings before the MPSC. In July2015, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appointed Norm Saari to serve on the three-member MPSC for a six-year term beginning in August2015, replacing retiring Commissioner Greg White. The governor also appointed Commissioner Sally Talberg to chair the MPSC beginning in January2016, replacing John Quackenbush, who will remain a commissioner through March2016. Other important regulatory events and developments are summarized below.
Electric Rate Cases: In December2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $163million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. In June2015, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $110million, subject to refund with interest. The MPSC issued an order in November2015, authorizing an annual rate 50 Table of Contents increase of $165million, based on a 10.3percent authorized rate of return on equity. In April2016, upon the planned retirement of seven coal-fueled electric generating units, the annual rate increase will be reduced by $39million to $126million.
Gas Rate Case: In July2015, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $85million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The largest component of the request is an annual revenue requirement of $64million related to new investments that will allow Consumers to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability.
The filing also seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: one that would reconcile annually Consumers actual weather-adjusted nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and another that would allow recovery of an additional $147million associated with investments to be made from January2017 through December2019, subject to reconciliation. These future investments would help to ensure adequate system capacity and deliverability. In January2016, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $60million, subject to refund with interest.
In March2015, Michigans governor outlined several key goals for the states energy policy, with a focus on increasing the use of clean energy sources, reducing Michigans reliance on coal, deploying smart meters, investing in the power grid and pipeline system, eliminating energy waste, and ensuring affordable, reliable, and adaptable energy while protecting the environment. The governor also created the Michigan Agency for Energy, a single entity dedicated to providing all of state government the information and context needed to support Michigans energy priorities.
In early 2015, members of the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives introduced various bills addressing renewable energy and energy efficiency and proposing changes to the regulatory process, such as establishing an energy planning process to determine the need for new energy investment. The bills also address ROA. Presently, under the 2008Energy Law, electric customers in Consumers service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. The bills introduced during 2015 propose a range of changes to ROA, including eliminating ROA, maintaining the existing ROA program but imposing conditions on a customers return to utility service, and raising the ROA limit. If the ROA limit were increased or if electric generation service in Michigan were deregulated, it could have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial results and operations. Presently, the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives are considering two separate but similar pieces of legislation to address energy policy. Consumers is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.
Environmental regulation is another area of importance for CMSEnergy and Consumers, and they are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including initiatives to regulate greenhouse gases, and related litigation. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that environmental laws and regulations related to their operations will continue to become more stringent and require them to make additional substantial capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, CCR disposal and storage, cooling water intake equipment, effluent treatment, and PCB remediation. Present and reasonably anticipated state and federal environmental statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Clean Air Act, including the Clean Power Plan, as well as the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and CERCLA, will continue to have a material effect on CMSEnergy and Consumers.
Financial Performance in 2015 and Beyond In 2015, CMSEnergys net income available to common stockholders was $523million, and diluted EPS were $1.89. This compares with net income available to common stockholders of $477million and 51 Table of Contents diluted EPS of $1.74 in 2014. Among the various factors contributing to CMSEnergys improved performance in 2015 were electric and gas rate increases, which were offset partially by decreased gas sales due primarily to colder winter weather in 2014.
Consumers utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment, while peak demand for natural gas occurs in the winter due to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. In addition, Consumers electric rates, which follow a seasonal rate design, are higher in the summer months than in the remaining months of the year. A more detailed discussion of the factors affecting CMSEnergys and Consumers performance can be found in the Results of Operations section that follows this Executive Overview.
Michigan is ranked third among states based on its strong economic growth since 2010. Consumers expects that the continued rise in industrial production will drive its electric deliveries to increase annually by about 0.5 to 1.0percent on average through 2020. Excluding the impacts of energy efficiency programs, Consumers expects its electric deliveries to increase by about 1.0 to 1.5percent annually through 2020. Consumers is projecting that its gas deliveries will remain stable through 2020. This outlook reflects growth in gas demand offset by energy efficiency and conservation.
As Consumers seeks to continue to receive fair and timely regulatory treatment, delivering customer value will remain a key strategic priority. In order to minimize increases in customer base rates, Consumers has set goals to achieve further annual productivity improvements. Additionally, Consumers will strive to give priority to capital investments that increase customer value or lower costs.
Consumers expects to continue to have sufficient borrowing capacity to fund its investment-based growth plans. CMSEnergy also expects its sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its cash requirements. To identify potential implications for CMSEnergys and Consumers businesses and future financial needs, the companies will continue to monitor developments in the financial and credit markets, as well as government policy responses to those developments.

Electric Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2015, electric delivery revenues increased $78million compared with 2014. This change reflected $67million from a rate increase that Consumers self-implemented in June2015, a $9million increase in revenues related to the renewable energy program, and a $2million increase in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.3billionkWh in 2015 and 37.6billionkWh in 2014.
54 Table of Contents For 2014, electric delivery revenues increased $36million compared with 2013. This change reflected a $33million benefit from a May2013 rate increase that Consumers self-implemented in March2013, $14million from a low-income assistance surcharge, and a $16million increase in revenues related to the renewable energy program. These increases were offset partially by a $27million reduction due primarily to a decrease in sales to Consumers higher-margin customers. Deliveries to end-use customers were 37.6billionkWh in 2014 and 36.9billionkWh in 2013.
Other Income, Net of Expenses: For 2015, other income, net of expenses, increased $25million compared with 2014. This change was due to a $13million decrease in charitable and political contributions, $6million related to a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, and a $6million gain related to a donation of CMSEnergy stock by Consumers. The gain was eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income. For additional details regarding the use tax settlement, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
For 2014, other income, net of expenses, decreased $16million compared with 2013. This decrease was due primarily to increased charitable and political contributions.
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2015, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $8million compared with 2014. This decrease was due to an $8million reduction in maintenance costs at the seven coal-fueled electric generating units planned for retirement in 2016, a $5million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense, and $11million of other operating and maintenance expenses. Additionally, there was a $9million reduction in service restoration costs, reflecting in part the increased capitalization of utility pole units, consistent with a change in regulatory treatment. These decreases were offset largely by a $25million increase in postretirement benefits expense attributable to changes in benefit plan assumptions.
For 2014, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $24million compared with 2013. This decrease was due to a $46million reduction in postretirement benefit costs attributable to OPEB Plan amendments made in July2013 and a $32million reduction in service restoration costs related primarily to severe storms that occurred in 2013. These decreases were offset largely by $14million of increased expenses related to a low-income assistance program, $14million of increased expenses associated with information technology projects, and $26million of higher forestry and other operating and maintenance expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization: For 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased $45million compared with 2014, and for 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $38million compared with 2013. Both increases were due to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service and higher amortization of securitized assets.
General Taxes: For 2015, general taxes increased $4million compared with 2014, and for 2014, general taxes increased $10million compared with 2013, due primarily to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending. In 2015, the increase was offset partially by a reduction in general taxes associated with a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015. For additional details regarding the use tax settlement, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Interest Charges: For 2015, interest charges decreased $3million compared with 2014. This change was due primarily to a $12million reduction in interest expense associated with a State of Michigan use tax settlement reached in 2015, offset largely by a $4million increase from higher average debt levels and a $5million increase in other interest charges related primarily to securitization bonds. For additional details regarding the use tax settlement, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Income Taxes: For 2015, income taxes increased $13million compared with 2014. Of this increase, $23million was attributable to higher electric utility earnings, which was offset partially by an $8million 55 Table of Contents benefit associated with Cross Winds  Energy Park production tax credits and a $2million decrease in other tax related items.
For 2014, income taxes decreased $30million compared with 2013. This change was due to the accelerated flow-through of income tax benefits under an MPSC accounting order that Consumers implemented in January2014.

Gas Deliveries and Rate Increases: For 2015, gas delivery revenues decreased $11million compared with 2014. This change reflected a $57million decrease in sales, due primarily to colder winter weather in 2014. This decrease was offset largely by a $43million rate increase implemented in January2015 and a $3million increase in other revenues. Deliveries to end-use customers were 299bcf in 2015 and 331bcf in 2014.
For 2014, gas delivery revenues increased $28million compared with 2013. This change reflected $32million of higher sales, due primarily to colder winter weather in 2014, and a $3million increase in other revenue, offset partially by a $7million decrease associated with the energy efficiency program. Deliveries to end-use customers were 331bcf in 2014 and 307bcf in 2013.
Other Income, Net of Expenses: For 2015, other income, net of expenses, increased $9million compared with 2014 due primarily to a $4million decrease in charitable contributions, $3million from a gain related to a donation of CMSEnergy stock by Consumers, and a $2million increase in other income. The gain was eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
For 2014, other income, net of expenses, decreased $4million compared with 2013, due to increased charitable contributions.
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses: For 2015, maintenance and other operating expenses increased $9million compared with 2014. This change was due to a $15million increase in postretirement benefits expense, attributable to changes in benefit plan assumptions, and a $10million increase in pipeline integrity expenses. These increases were offset partially by a $16million reduction in uncollectible accounts expense due primarily to the successful implementation of new collection practices.
For 2014, maintenance and other operating expenses decreased $5million compared with 2013. This decrease was due to a $27million reduction in postretirement benefit costs attributable to OPEB Plan 56 Table of Contents amendments made in July2013, and a $7million decrease in expenses related to the energy efficiency program. These decreases were offset largely by a $5million increase in expenses associated with information technology projects, a $9million increase in uncollectible accounts expense, and a $15million increase related to pipeline integrity and other gas operating and maintenance expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization: For 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased $21million compared with 2014, and for 2014, depreciation and amortization expense increased $18million compared with 2013. Both increases were due to higher depreciation expense from increased plant in service.
General Taxes: For 2015, general taxes increased $6million compared with 2014, and for 2014, general taxes increased $6million compared with 2013. Both increases were due to increased property taxes, reflecting higher capital spending.
Interest Charges: For 2015, interest charges increased $4million compared with 2014 due to higher average debt levels.
Income Taxes: For 2015, income taxes decreased $17million compared with 2014 attributable to lower gas utility earnings.
For 2014, income taxes decreased $9million compared with 2013. This change was due primarily to the accelerated flow-through of income tax benefits under an MPSC accounting order that Consumers implemented in January2014.

For 2014, the enterprises segment recorded a net loss of $1million, compared with net income of $2million in 2013. The $3million change was due primarily to a $9million after-tax increase in the environmental remediation liability associated with Bay Harbor, offset partially by the absence in 2014 of $4million in additional tax expense related to OPEB Plan changes adopted in July2013 and $2million in lower after-tax administrative and maintenance expenses.

These decreases were offset partially by $6million of additional income tax 57 Table of Contents expense attributable to higher MCIT and to the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain tax credits.
For 2014, corporate interest and other net expenses increased $4million compared with 2013. A $10million increase in after-tax losses on the early extinguishment of debt was offset partially by a $3million reduction in miscellaneous corporate costs and a $3million benefit due primarily to higher earnings at EnerBank.
CASH POSITION,INVESTING, AND FINANCING At December31,2015, CMSEnergy had $285million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents, which included $19million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. At December31,2015, Consumers had $69million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents, which included $19million of restricted cash and cash equivalents.

2 Core working capital comprises accounts receivable, notes receivable, accrued revenue (including accrued gas revenue), inventories, accounts payable, and accrued rate refunds.
For 2015, net cash provided by operating activities at CMSEnergy increased $193million compared with 2014 and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers increased $456million compared with 2014. These changes were due primarily to gas purchases at lower prices, improved customer collections, and higher net income, net of non-cash transactions, offset partially by higher postretirement benefits contributions. At Consumers, lower income tax payments to CMSEnergy also contributed to the improvement in 2015.
58 Table of Contents For 2014, net cash provided by operating activities at CMSEnergy increased $26million compared with 2013, and net cash provided by operating activities at Consumers decreased $13million compared with 2013. At CMSEnergy and Consumers, increases in net cash provided by operating activities were due primarily to lower postretirement benefits contributions and higher cash collections of accounts receivable from customers, offset partially by an increase in GCR underrecoveries, higher gas volumes purchased due to lower initial gas inventory levels, and the absence, in 2014, of the receipt of a $69million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park . At Consumers, these increases were also offset by higher income tax payments to CMSEnergy.
Investing Activities Presented in the following table are specific components of net cash used in investing activities for 2015, 2014, and 2013: In Millions Years Ended December31 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 Change CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Capital   expenditures $ (1,564 ) $ (1,577 ) $ 13 $ (1,577 ) $ (1,325 ) $ (252 ) Jackson plant   acquisition (154 ) - (154 ) - - - Change in   EnerBank notes receivable (279 ) (255 ) (24 ) (255 ) (139 ) (116 ) Proceeds from   the sale of EnerBank notes receivable 48 - 48 - - - DBSERP   fund contribution (25 ) - (25 ) - (16 ) 16 Costs to retire   property and other (70 ) (78 ) 8 (78 ) (52 ) (26 ) Net cash used in   investing activities $ (2,044 ) $ (1,910 ) $ (134 ) $ (1,910 ) $ (1,532 ) $ (378 ) Consumers Capital   expenditures $ (1,537 ) $ (1,573 ) $ 36 $ (1,573 ) $ (1,320 ) $ (253 ) Jackson plant   acquisition (154 ) - (154 ) - - - DBSERP   fund contribution (17 ) - (17 ) - (13 ) 13 Costs to retire property   and other (73 ) (80 ) 7 (80 ) (54 ) (26 ) Net cash used in   investing activities $ (1,781 ) $ (1,653 ) $ (128 ) $ (1,653 ) $ (1,387 ) $ (266 ) For 2015, net cash used in investing activities at CMSEnergy increased $134million compared with 2014 and net cash used in investing activities at Consumers increased $128million compared with 2014. The changes were due primarily to the acquisition of the Jackson power plant.
For 2014, net cash used in investing activities at CMSEnergy increased $378million compared with 2013, and net cash used in investing activities at Consumers increased $266million compared with 2013. The changes were due to increases in capital expenditures under Consumers capital investment program and, at CMSEnergy, faster growth in EnerBank consumer lending.
59 Table of Contents Financing Activities Presented in the following table are specific components of net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2015, 2014, and 2013: In Millions Years Ended   December31 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 Change CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Issuance of debt $ 599 $ 1,428 $ (829 ) $ 1,428 $ 1,025 $ 403 Net increase in   EnerBank certificates of deposit 214 233 (19 ) 233 125 108 Issuance of   common stock 43 43 - 43 36 7 Retirement of   debt (224 ) (750 ) 526 (750 ) (741 ) (9 ) Payments of   dividends on common and preferred stock (322 ) (295 ) (27 ) (295 ) (273 ) (22 ) Change in notes   payable 189 (110 ) 299 (110 ) 60 (170 ) Other financing   activities (36 ) (51 ) 15 (51 ) (42 ) (9 ) Net cash   provided by financing activities $ 463 $ 498 $ (35 ) $ 498 $ 190 $ 308 Consumers Issuance of debt $ 250 $ 878 $ (628 ) $ 878 $ 750 $ 128 Stockholder   contribution from CMSEnergy, net 150 317 (167 ) 317 150 167 Payments of   dividends on common and preferred stock (476 ) (459 ) (17 ) (459 ) (408 ) (51 ) Retirement of   debt (124 ) (220 ) 96 (220 ) (466 ) 246 Change in notes   payable 189 (110 ) 299 (110 ) 60 (170 ) Other financing   activities (23 ) (38 ) 15 (38 ) (37 ) (1 ) Net cash   provided by (used in) financing activities $ (34 ) $ 368 $ (402 ) $ 368 $ 49 $ 319 For 2015, net cash provided by financing activities at CMSEnergy decreased $35million compared with 2014 and net cash used in financing activities at Consumers increased $402million compared with 2014. These changes were due primarily to a decrease in debt issuances, offset partially by a decrease in debt retirements and by lower repayments under Consumers commercial paper program. Lower stockholder contributions from CMSEnergy also contributed to the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 at Consumers.
For 2014, net cash provided by financing activities at CMSEnergy increased $308million compared with 2013 and net cash provided by financing activities at Consumers increased $319million compared with 2013. At CMSEnergy and Consumers, the changes were due primarily to an increase in net debt issuances, offset partially by higher repayments under Consumers revolving accounts receivable sales program. At Consumers, the change was also due to increased stockholder contributions by CMSEnergy, offset partially by increases in Consumers dividend payments to CMSEnergy.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY CMSEnergy uses dividends and tax-sharing payments from its subsidiaries and external financing and capital transactions to invest in its utility and non-utility businesses, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund its other obligations. The ability of CMSEnergys subsidiaries, including Consumers, to pay dividends to CMSEnergy depends upon each subsidiarys revenues, earnings, cash needs, and other factors. In addition, Consumers ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain terms included in its debt covenants and articles of incorporation, and potentially by FERC requirements and provisions under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act. For additional details on Consumers dividend restrictions, see 60 Table of Contents Note5, Financings and CapitalizationDividend Restrictions. For the year ended December31,2015, Consumers paid $474million in dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy.
As a result of federal tax legislation passed in December2015 that extends bonus depreciation, CMSEnergy expects to be able to extend the use of federal net operating loss carryforwards by two years and, accordingly, defer its federal income tax payments through 2019. As a consequence, however, CMSEnergy expects to receive lower tax-sharing payments from Consumers during that period. This may require CMSEnergy to maintain higher levels of debt in order to invest in its businesses, pay dividends, and fund its general obligations. Despite this, CMSEnergy does not anticipate a need for a block equity offering.
In April2015, CMSEnergy entered into an updated continuous equity offering program. Under this program, CMSEnergy may sell, from time to time in at the market offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100million. In2015, CMSEnergy issued common stock under the program and received net proceeds of $30million.
Consumers uses cash flows generated from operations and external financing transactions, as well as stockholder contributions from CMSEnergy, to fund capital expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, contribute to its employee benefit plans, and fund its other obligations. As a result of accelerated pension funding in recent years and several initiatives to reduce costs, Consumers anticipates continued strong cash flows from operating activities in 2016.
Access to the financial and capital markets depends on CMSEnergys and Consumers credit ratings and on market conditions. As evidenced by past financing transactions, CMSEnergy and Consumers have had ready access to these markets. Barring major market dislocations or disruptions, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to continue to have ready access to the financial and capital markets. If access to these markets were to diminish or otherwise become restricted, CMSEnergy and Consumers would implement contingency plans to address debt maturities, which could include reduced capital spending.
At December31,2015, CMSEnergy had $549million of its secured revolving credit facility available, and Consumers had $891million available. CMSEnergy and Consumers use these credit facilities for general working capital purposes and to issue letters of credit. An additional source of liquidity is Consumers commercial paper program, which allows Consumers to issue, in one or more placements, up to $500million in the aggregate in commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365days and that bear interest at fixed or floating rates. These issuances are supported by one of Consumers revolving credit facilities. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the revolving credit facilitys available capacity, Consumers would not issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available facility capacity. At December31,2015, $249million of commercial paper notes were outstanding under this program. For additional details on CMSEnergys and Consumers secured revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, see Note5, Financings and Capitalization.
61 Table of Contents Certain of CMSEnergys and Consumers credit agreements, debt indentures, and other facilities contain covenants that require CMSEnergy and Consumers to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined therein. At December31,2015, no default had occurred with respect to any financial covenants contained in CMSEnergys and Consumers credit agreements, debt indentures, or other facilities. CMSEnergy and Consumers were each in compliance with these covenants as of December31,2015, as presented in the following table: December31,2015 Credit   Agreement,Indenture, or Facility Limit Actual CMSEnergy parent 1 Debt to EBITDA 2 < 6.0 to 1.0 4.5 to 1.0 Consumers Debt to Capital 3 < 0.65 to 1.0 0.49 to 1.0 1 In June2015, CMSEnergy replaced its $180million term loan agreement with a new term loan agreement. Under the new agreement, CMSEnergy is no longer required to calculate an interest coverage ratio.
2 Applies to CMSEnergys $550million revolving and $180million term loan credit agreements.
3 Applies to Consumers $650million, $250million, and $30million revolving credit agreements and $35million and $68million reimbursement agreements.
Components of CMSEnergys and Consumers cash management plan include controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures and evaluating market conditions for financing and refinancing opportunities. CMSEnergys and Consumers present level of cash and expected cash flows from operating activities, together with access to sources of liquidity, are anticipated to be sufficient to fund the companies contractual obligations for 2016 and beyond.
62 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations: Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers contractual obligations. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated balance sheets, other than the current portion of long-term debt, capital leases, and financing obligation.

CMSEnergy and Consumers also have recognized non-current liabilities for which the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. These items, which are excluded from the table above, include regulatory liabilities, deferred income taxes, workers compensation liabilities, accrued liabilities under renewable energy programs, and other liabilities. Retirement benefits are also excluded from the table above. For details related to benefit payments, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
63 Table of Contents Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements: CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries enter into various arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, and financial and performance guarantees. Indemnities are usually agreements to reimburse a counterparty that may incur losses due to outside claims or breach of contract terms. The maximum payment that could be required under a number of these indemnity obligations is not estimable; the maximum obligation under indemnities for which such amounts were estimable was $143million at December31,2015. While CMSEnergy and Consumers believe it is unlikely that they will incur any material losses related to indemnities they have not recorded as liabilities, they cannot predict the impact of these contingent obligations on their liquidity and financial condition. For additional details on these and other guarantee arrangements, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsGuarantees.
Capital Expenditures: Over the next fiveyears, CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to make substantial capital investments. CMSEnergy and Consumers may revise their forecasts of capital expenditures periodically due to a number of factors, including environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital. Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers estimated capital expenditures, including lease commitments, for 2016 through 2020: In Billions 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Total CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Consumers $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ 8.4 Enterprises - - - 0.1 0.1 0.2 Total   CMSEnergy $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 8.6 Consumers Electric utility   operations $ 1.1 $ 1.0 $ 0.9 $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 5.0 Gas utility   operations 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 3.4 Total Consumers $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ 8.4 OUTLOOK Several business trends and uncertainties may affect CMSEnergys and Consumers financial condition and results of operations. These trends and uncertainties could have a material impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position. For additional details regarding these and other uncertainties, see Forward-Looking Statements and Information; Item1A. Risk Factors; and Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Consumers Electric Utility and Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Energy Optimization Plan: The 2008Energy Law requires Consumers to have achieved cumulative reductions of 5.6percent in customers electricity use and 3.9percent in customers natural gas use by December31,2015.
Consumers exceeded the requirements, with cumulative reductions of 6.8percent in customers electricity use and 4.9percent in customers natural gas use at December31,2015; the savings results will be certified at the end of the plan year by a third party. Consumers estimates that, through its gas and electric energy optimization programs, its customers realized about $300million in energy bill savings during 2015.
Under the continuing energy optimization plan, Consumers provides its customers with incentives to reduce usage by offering energy audits, rebates and discounts on purchases of highly efficient appliances, and other incentives and programs.
In December2015, the MPSC approved Consumers 2016-2017energy optimization plan.
64 Table of Contents Smart Energy: In2012, Consumers began installing smart meters for electric residential and small business customers. Smart meters allow customers to monitor and manage their energy usage, which Consumers expects will help reduce demand during critical peak times, resulting in lower peak electric capacity requirements. In addition, Consumers is able to disconnect and reconnect service, read, and bill from smart meters remotely. Consumers will continue to add further functionality to its smart meters.
As of December31,2015, Consumers had upgraded 823,000 electric customers in Michigan to smart meters. Consumers expects that it will have installed a total of 1.8million smart meters throughout its service territory by the end of 2017. Of the customers scheduled for the upgrade, 0.5percent have chosen not to participate in the smart meter program. Also as of December31,2015, Consumers had installed 49,000 communication modules on gas meters in areas where Consumers provides both electricity and natural gas to customers. The communication modules allow Consumers to read and bill from gas meters remotely. Consumers expects that it will have installed a total of 600,000 communication modules on gas meters throughout its service territory by the end of 2017.
Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Clean Energy Plan: Consumers continues to experience increasing demand for electricity due to Michigans recovering economy and increased use of air conditioning, consumer electronics, and other electric devices, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. In order to address future capacity requirements and growing electric demand in Michigan, Consumers has a comprehensive clean energy plan designed to meet the short-term and long-term electricity needs of its customers through:  energy efficiency  demand management  expanded use of renewable energy  construction or purchase of electric generating units  continued operation or upgrade of existing units  purchases of short-term market capacity In December2015, Consumers completed the purchase of a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant located in Jackson, Michigan for $155million from AlphaGen PowerLLC and DPCJuniper,LLC, affiliates of JPMorgan Chase& Co. For additional details on the purchase, see Note9, Plant, Property, and Equipment. With the purchase of this plant, upgrades at Ludington, energy efficiency programs, and demand management programs, Consumers expects its existing resources to be adequate to meet the capacity requirements of its full-service customers for 2016 through 2020, even with the planned retirement of seven coal-fueled electric generating units by April2016. As demand forecasts become more certain, Consumers may take additional actions to cover any remaining capacity requirements, including participation in the annual MISO planning resource auction.
In 2014, Consumers deferred the development of a proposed 700-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant at its Thetford complex in Genesee County, Michigan, which Consumers estimated would have cost $700million. The MDEQ granted an extension of the projects air permit in January2015. The permit will be void if Consumers does not start construction or obtain a further extension before July2016.
Renewable Energy Plan: Consumers renewable energy plan details how Consumers expects to meet REC and capacity standards prescribed by the 2008Energy Law. This law requires Consumers to submit RECs, which represent proof that the associated electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource, in an amount equal to at least tenpercent of Consumers electric sales volume (estimated to be 3.3million RECs annually) each year. Under its renewable energy plan, Consumers expects to meet its 65 Table of Contents renewable energy requirement each year with a combination of newly generated RECs and previously generated RECs carried over from prior years.
The 2008Energy Law also required Consumers to obtain 500MW of new capacity from renewable energy resources by the end of 2015, either through generation resources owned by Consumers or through agreements to purchase capacity from other parties. Consumers met its renewable capacity requirement in December2014, one year earlier than required, through construction of its Lake Winds  and Cross Winds  Energy Parks, with a combined nameplate capacity of 212MW, and through agreements to purchase 298MW of nameplate capacity from renewable energy suppliers. Additionally, in September2015, Consumers signed a 15-year agreement to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 100-MW wind park to be constructed in Huron County, Michigan. The wind park is expected to be operational in late 2016. Consumers has also begun to construct two community solar projects that will provide a combined fourMW of nameplate capacity.
Cross Winds  Energy Park qualifies for certain federal production tax credits that will reduce significantly the cost of complying with the renewable requirements of the 2008Energy Law. Consumers expects to receive $100million to $120million of federal production tax credits, which will be realized over the first tenyears of the wind projects operation. These cost savings will be passed on to customers.
Electric Customer Deliveries and Revenue: Consumers electric customer deliveries are largely dependent on Michigans economy. Consumers expects weather-adjusted electric deliveries to increase in 2016 by 1.5 to 2.0percent compared with 2015.
Over the next fiveyears, Consumers plans conservatively for average electric delivery growth of about 0.5 to 1.0percent annually. This increase reflects growth in electric demand, offset partially by the predicted effects of energy efficiency programs and appliance efficiency standards. Actual delivery levels will depend on:  energy conservation measures and results of energy efficiency programs  weather fluctuations  Michigans economic conditions, including utilization, expansion, or contraction of manufacturing facilities, population trends, and housing activity Electric ROA: The 2008Energy Law allows electric customers in Consumers service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to tenpercent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December31,2015, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit and alternative electric suppliers were providing 751MW of generation service to ROA customers. Of Consumers 1.8million electric customers, 304customers, or 0.02percent, purchased generation service under the ROA program.
2016 Michigan Energy Legislation: In March2015, Michigans governor outlined several key goals for the states energy policy, with a focus on increasing the use of clean energy sources, reducing Michigans reliance on coal, deploying smart meters, investing in the power grid and pipeline system, eliminating energy waste, and ensuring affordable, reliable, and adaptable energy while protecting the environment. The governor also created the Michigan Agency for Energy, a single entity dedicated to providing all of state government the information and context needed to support Michigans energy priorities.
In early 2015, members of the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives introduced various bills addressing renewable energy and energy efficiency and proposing changes to the regulatory process, such as establishing an energy planning process to determine the need for new energy investment. The bills also propose a range of changes to ROA, including eliminating ROA, maintaining the existing ROA program but imposing conditions on a customers return to utility service, and raising the ROA limit. Presently, the Michigan Senate and House of Representatives are considering two separate but similar 66 Table of Contents pieces of legislation to address energy policy. Consumers is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.
Electric Transmission: In 2012, ReliabilityFirst Corporation informed Consumers that Consumers may not have been properly registered to meet certain NERC electric reliability standards. Consumers assessed its registration status, taking into consideration FERCs December2012 order on the definition of a bulk electric system, and became registered under NERC standards as a transmission owner, transmission planner, and transmission operator in October2015. In addition, Consumers received approval from the MPSC and FERC to reclassify $34million of net plant assets from distribution to transmission. Consumers expects to complete the reclassification in 2016. Consumers is pursuing FERC approval to begin earning transmission revenues under MISOs transmission tariff.
In a separate matter, METC notified Consumers that the reclassified assets need to be conveyed by Consumers to METC under the terms of the DTIA. Consumers disagrees with METCs interpretation of the provisions of the DTIA.
Electric Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers electric utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters.
PSCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2016 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2015 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2016 PSCR charge beginning in January2016.
Electric Environmental Outlook: Consumers operations are subject to various state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Consumers estimates that it will incur capital expenditures of $0.7billion from 2016 through 2020 to continue to comply with the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and numerous state and federal environmental regulations. Consumers expects to recover these costs in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. Consumers primary environmental compliance focus includes, but is not limited to, the following matters: Air Quality: CSAPR, which became effective in January2015, requires Michigan and 27 other states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that, according to EPA computer models, contribute to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution in other downwind states. In December2015, the EPA proposed new ozone-season standards for CSAPR, which would begin in 2017. Consumers expects its emissions to be within the CSAPR allowance allocations.
In 2012, the EPA published emission standards for electric generating units, based on Section112 of the Clean Air Act, calling the final ruleMATS. Under MATS, all of Consumers existing coal-fueled electric generating units are required to add additional controls for hazardous air pollutants. Consumers expects to meet the extended deadline of April2016 for five coal-fueled units and two oil/gas-fueled units it intends to continue operating and plans to retire its seven remaining coal-fueled units by the extended deadline. MATS is presently being litigated, and in June2015 the U.S.Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case back to the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit. Numerous states and industry parties filed motions to vacate the rulein its entirety, while other parties, including the EPA, sought to have the matter remanded back to the EPA to cure any deficiencies while keeping the rulein effect. In December2015, the D.C.Circuit remanded MATS back to the EPA without vacating the entire rule. These decisions do not presently impact Consumers MATS compliance strategy. In addition, Consumers must still comply with the Michigan Mercury Ruleand with its settlement agreement with the EPA entered into in November2014 concerning opacity and NSR.
In October2015, the EPA released its new ruleto lower the NAAQS for ozone. The new ozone NAAQS will make it more difficult to construct or modify power plants in many areas of the country, including some parts of Michigan, if the areas are designated to be in nonattainment of the new standard. Consumers is evaluating this ruleto determine what, if any, effect it will have on its electric generating units.
67 Table of Contents Presently, Consumers strategy to comply with air quality regulations, including CSAPR, NAAQS, and MATS, involves the installation of emission control equipment at some facilities and the suspension of operations at others; however, Consumers continues to evaluate these rulesin conjunction with other EPA rulemakings, litigation, and congressional action. This evaluation could result in:  changes in environmental compliance costs related to Consumers coal-fueled power units  a change in the fuel mix at coal-fueled and oil-fueled power units  changes in how certain units are used  the retirement, mothballing, or repowering with an alternative fuel of some of Consumers generating units Greenhouse Gases: There have been numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state, regional, national, and international levels that involve the potential regulation of greenhouse gases. Consumers continues to monitor and comment on these initiatives and to follow litigation involving greenhouse gases. Consumers believes Congress may eventually pass greenhouse gas legislation, but is unable to predict the form and timing of any final legislation.
In August2015, the EPA finalized new rulespursuant to Section111(b)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new electric generating units. New coal-fueled units will not be able to meet this limit without installing carbon dioxide control equipment using such methods as carbon capture and sequestration. Also in August2015, the EPA finalized new rulespursuant to Section111(b)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from modified or reconstructed electric generating units.
In October2015, the EPA published final rulespursuant to Section111(d)of the Clean Air Act to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric generating units, calling the rulesthe Clean Power Plan. The ruleswill require a 32percent nationwide reduction in carbon emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (based on 2005 levels). Initial state implementation plans are due by September2016, but extensions are available until 2018. States choosing not to develop their own implementation plans will be subject to the federal plan.
Certain states, corporations, and industry groups have initiated litigation opposing the proposed Clean Power Plan. While Michigans Attorney General has joined the litigation, the governor has indicated that Michigan plans to file a state carbon implementation plan while litigation proceeds.
In December2015, a group of 195 countries finalized the Paris Agreement, which governs carbon dioxide reduction measures beginning in 2020. As part of this agreement, the United States pledged a 26percent reduction in greenhouse-gas-emissions by 2025 (with aspirations to achieve a 28percent reduction) compared with 2005 levels. These targets are in line with the Clean Power Plan targets. While these emission reduction commitments are non-binding, they will be governed by the Clean Power Plan.
Consumers believes that its clean energy plan, its present carbon reduction target, and its emphasis on supply diversity position it favorably to deal with the impact of carbon regulation. Consumers cannot, however, predict the outcome of these EPA rulesin court, or of Michigans implementation plan, which may not be submitted for EPA review and approval until 2018. Consumers will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding greenhouse gas emissions standards that may affect electric generating units.
Litigation, as well as federal laws, EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gases, or similar treaties, state laws, or rules, if enacted or ratified, could require Consumers to replace equipment, install additional emission control equipment, purchase emission allowances, curtail operations, arrange for alternative sources of supply, or take other steps to manage or lower the emission of greenhouse gases. Although associated capital or operating costs relating to greenhouse gas regulation or legislation could be material and cost recovery cannot be assured, Consumers expects to recover these costs and capital expenditures in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations.
68 Table of Contents CCRs: In April2015, the EPA published a final ruleregulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The final ruleadopts minimum standards for beneficially reusing and disposing of non-hazardous CCRs. The ruleestablishes new minimum requirements for site location, groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust control, and public disclosure of information. The rulealso sets out conditions under which CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR and non-CCR waste and initiate closure based on the inability to achieve minimum safety standards, meet a location standard, or meet minimum groundwater standards. For additional details regarding the impact of this ruleon Consumers, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsConsumers Electric Utility ContingenciesElectric Environmental Matters and Note11, Asset Retirement Obligations.
Water: The EPAs ruleto regulate existing electric generating plant cooling water intake systems under Section316(b)of the Clean Water Act became effective in October2014. The ruleis aimed at reducing alleged harmful impacts on fish and shellfish. Consumers does not expect adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the final rule. In November2015, the EPA released its final effluent limitation guidelines, which set stringent new requirements for the discharge of arsenic, mercury, selenium, and nitrogen from electric generating units into wastewater streams. Consumers has increased by $30million its forecast of capital expenditures to comply with the final rule.
In June2015, the EPA and the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers published a final ruleredefining waters of the United States, which designates the EPAs jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Numerous states and other interested parties, including Michigans Attorney General, have filed suits in federal courts to block the rule, which was stayed in October2015, and that litigation remains pending. Consumers does not expect any adverse changes to its environmental strategy as a result of the final rule.
Many of Consumers facilities maintain NPDES permits, which are valid for fiveyears and vital to the facilities operations. Failure of the MDEQ to renew any NPDES permit, a successful appeal against a permit, or onerous terms contained in a permit could have a significant detrimental effect on the operations of a facility.
PCBs: In 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, indicating that it is considering a variety of regulatory actions with respect to PCBs. One approach would aim to phase out equipment containing PCBs by 2025. Another approach would eliminate an exemption for small equipment containing PCBs. To comply with any such regulatory actions, Consumers could incur substantial costs associated with existing electrical equipment potentially containing PCBs. A proposed ruleis expected in 2016.
Other electric environmental matters could have a material impact on Consumers outlook. For additional details on other electric environmental matters, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsConsumers Electric Utility ContingenciesElectric Environmental Matters.
Consumers Gas Utility Outlook and Uncertainties Gas Deliveries: Consumers expects weather-adjusted gas deliveries in 2016 to increase by 0.5percent compared with 2015. Over the next fiveyears, Consumers plans conservatively for stable deliveries. This outlook reflects modest growth in gas demand offset by the predicted effects of energy efficiency and conservation. Actual delivery levels from year to year may vary from this expectation due to:  weather fluctuations  use by power producers  availability and development of renewable energy sources  gas price changes  Michigan economic conditions, including population trends and housing activity 69 Table of Contents  the price of competing energy sources or fuels  energy efficiency and conservation impacts Gas Rate Matters: Rate matters are critical to Consumers gas utility business. For additional details on rate matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters.
Gas Rate Case: In July2015, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $85million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The largest component of the request is an annual revenue requirement of $64million related to new investments that will allow Consumers to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability.
The filing also seeks approval of two rate adjustment mechanisms: one that would reconcile annually Consumers actual weather-adjusted nonfuel revenues with the revenues approved by the MPSC, and another that would allow recovery of an additional $147million associated with investments to be made from January2017 through December2019, subject to reconciliation. These future investments would help to ensure adequate system capacity and deliverability. In January2016, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $60million, subject to refund with interest.
GCR Plan: Consumers submitted its 2016-2017 GCR plan to the MPSC in December2015 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, expects to self-implement the 2016-2017 GCR charge beginning in April2016.
Gas Environmental Outlook: Consumers expects to incur response activity costs at a number of sites, including 23former MGP sites. For additional details, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsConsumers Gas Utility ContingenciesGas Environmental Matters.
Enterprises Outlook and Uncertainties The primary focus with respect to CMSEnergys non-utility businesses is to optimize cash flow and maximize the value of their generating assets, which represent 1,077MW of capacity.
Trends, uncertainties, and other matters that could have a material impact on CMSEnergys consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position include:  changes in energy and capacity prices  changes in commodity prices and interest rates on certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and must be marked to market through earnings  changes in various environmental laws, regulations, principles, or practices, or in their interpretation  the outcome of certain legal proceedings  indemnity and environmental remediation obligations at Bay Harbor  obligations related to a tax claim from the government of Equatorial Guinea  representations, warranties, and indemnities provided by CMSEnergy in connection with previous sales of assets For additional details regarding the enterprises segments uncertainties, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Other Outlook and Uncertainties EnerBank: EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank represented threepercent of CMSEnergys net assets at December31,2015, and fivepercent of CMSEnergys net income available to 70 Table of Contents common stockholders for the year ended December31,2015. The carrying value of EnerBanks loan portfolio was $1.2billion at December31,2015. Its loan portfolio was funded primarily by certificates of deposit of $1.1billion. The twelve-month rolling average net default rate on loans held by EnerBank has remained stable at 0.6percent at December31,2015. CMSEnergy is required both by law and by contract to provide financial support, including infusing additional capital, to ensure that EnerBank satisfies mandated capital requirements and has sufficient liquidity to operate. With its self-funding plan, EnerBank has exceeded these requirements historically and exceeded them as of December31,2015.
Litigation: CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain of their subsidiaries are named as parties in various litigation matters, as well as in administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies, arising in the ordinary course of business. For additional details regarding these and other legal matters, see Note3, Regulatory Matters and Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following accounting policies and related information are important to an understanding of CMSEnergys and Consumers results of operations and financial condition. For additional accounting policies, see Note1, Significant Accounting Policies.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions In the preparation of CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are used that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. CMSEnergy and Consumers use accounting estimates for asset valuations, unbilled revenue, depreciation, amortization, financial and derivative instruments, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, the effects of regulation, indemnities, and contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated results due to changes in the regulatory environment, regulatory decisions, lawsuits, competition, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider all relevant factors in making these assessments.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts: CMSEnergy and Consumers make ongoing estimates related to the collectibility of their accounts receivable and establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses, managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. Actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from those estimated by CMSEnergy and Consumers.
Asset Retirement Obligations: CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives if there is a legal obligation to remove them. CMSEnergy and Consumers have legal obligations to remove some of their assets at the end of their useful lives. CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities using an expected present-value technique that reflects assumptions about costs and inflation, and uses a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the expected cash flows. CMSEnergys ARO liabilities are primarily at Consumers. As a regulated entity, Consumers defers the effects of any changes in assumptions on the fair values of its ARO liabilities, adjusting the associated regulatory assets or liabilities rather than recognizing such effects in earnings. For additional details, see Note11, Asset Retirement Obligations.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers make judgments regarding the future outcome of various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. For such matters, they record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable, based on all available information. In particular, CMSEnergy and Consumers are participating in various environmental remediation projects for which they have recorded liabilities. The recorded amounts represent estimates that may take into account such considerations as the number of sites, the anticipated scope, cost, and timing of remediation work, the available technology, applicable regulations, and the requirements of governmental authorities. For remediation projects in which the timing of estimated expenditures is considered reliably determinable, 71 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers record the liability at its net present value, using a discount rate equal to the interest rate on monetary assets that are essentially risk-free and have maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. For additional details, see Note4, Contingencies and Commitments.
Fair Value Measurements: CMSEnergy and Consumers have assets and liabilities that are accounted for or disclosed at fair value. Fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Development of these assumptions may require judgment. For a detailed discussion of the valuation techniques and inputs used to calculate fair value measurements, see Note6, Fair Value Measurements. Details about the fair value measurements for the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan assets are included in Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Income Taxes: The amount of income taxes paid by CMSEnergy is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. An estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy believes adequate reserves have been provided for these exposures; however, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, CMSEnergys judgment as to the ability to recover its deferred tax assets may change. CMSEnergy believes the valuation allowances related to its deferred tax assets are adequate, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments. As a result, CMSEnergys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly over time. For additional details, see Note14,Income Taxes.
Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMSEnergy and Consumers assess the recoverability of their long-lived assets and equity method investments by performing impairment tests if certain triggering events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary. The estimates that CMSEnergy and Consumers use may change over time, which could have a material impact on their consolidated financial statements.
Unbilled Revenues: Consumers customers are billed monthly in cycles having billing dates that do not generally coincide with the end of a calendar month. This results in customers having received electricity or gas that they have not been billed for as of the month-end. Consumers estimates its unbilled revenues by applying an average billed rate to total unbilled deliveries for each customer class. Unbilled revenues, which are recorded as accounts receivable on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated balance sheets, were $325million at December31,2015 and $459million at December31,2014.
Accounting for the Effects of Industry Regulation Because Consumers has regulated operations, it uses regulatory accounting to recognize the effects of the regulators decisions on its financial statements.
Consumers continually assesses whether future recovery of its regulatory assets is probable by considering communications and experience with its regulators and changes in the regulatory environment. If Consumers determined that recovery of a regulatory asset were not probable, Consumers would be required to write off the asset and immediately recognize the expense in earnings.
Alternative-Revenue Program: In 2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC. Consumers recognized revenue under this program of $18million in 2015, $17million in 2014, and $22million in 2013.
72 Table of Contents Revenue Subject to Refund: Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing; however, the rates that Consumers self-implements may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, it records a provision for revenue subject to refund. A final rate order could differ materially from Consumers estimates underlying its self-implemented rates, giving rise to accounting adjustments. Under accounting rulesfor prior period adjustments, CMSEnergy and Consumers may need to record such differences, if they are specifically identifiable to prior interim periods, as revisions to those periods. At December31,2015 and 2014, Consumers had no significant regulatory liabilities recorded related to self-implemented rates.
Financial and Derivative Instruments and Market Risk Information Financial Instruments: Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these securities are reported, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers account for certain contracts as derivative instruments. If a contract is a derivative and does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, it is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Each quarter, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract.
The criteria used to determine if an instrument qualifies for derivative accounting or for an exception from derivative accounting are complex and often require judgment in application. Changes in business strategies or market conditions, as well as a requirement to apply different interpretations of the derivative accounting literature, could result in changes in accounting for a single contract or groups of contracts, which could have a material impact on CMSEnergys and Consumers financial statements. For additional details on CMSEnergys and Consumers derivatives and how the fair values of derivatives are determined, see Note6, Fair Value Measurements.
Market Risk Information: CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to market risks including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and investment security prices. They may enter into various risk management contracts to mitigate exposure to these risks, including swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into these contracts using established policies and procedures, under the direction of an executive oversight committee consisting of certain officers and a risk committee consisting of those and other officers and business managers.
The following risk sensitivities illustrate the potential loss in fair value, cash flows, or future earnings from financial instruments, assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates or prices of tenpercent. Potential losses could exceed the amounts shown in the sensitivity analyses if changes in market rates or prices were to exceed tenpercent.
Interest-Rate Risk : CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from issuing fixed-rate and variable-rate financing instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers use a combination of these instruments, and may also enter into interest-rate swap agreements, in order to manage this risk and to achieve a reasonable cost of capital.
73 Table of Contents Presented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of interest-rate risk (assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of tenpercent): In   Millions December31 2015 2014 Fixed-rate financing  potential loss in fair   value CMSEnergy,   including Consumers $263 $247 Consumers 161 151 The fair value losses in the above table could be realized only if CMSEnergy and Consumers transferred all of their fixed-rate financing to other creditors. The annual earnings exposure related to variable-rate financing was insignificant for both CMSEnergy and Consumers at December31,2015 and 2014, assuming an adverse change in market interest rates of tenpercent.
Investment Securities Price Risk: Through investments in equity securities, CMSEnergy and Consumers are exposed to equity price fluctuations. The following table shows the potential effect of adverse changes in equity prices on CMS Energys and Consumers available-for-sale investments.
Presented in the following table is a sensitivity analysis of investment securities price risk (assuming an adverse change in market prices of tenpercent): In   Millions December31 2015 2014 CMSEnergy, including Consumers Potential reduction in fair value of   available-for-sale securities DBSERP Mutual   funds $15 $13 Consumers Potential reduction in fair value of   available-for-sale securities DBSERP Mutual   funds $10 $9 CMSEnergy   common stock 3 4 Notes Receivable Risk: CMSEnergy is exposed to interest-rate risk resulting from EnerBanks fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank provides these loans to homeowners to finance home improvements.

For additional details on financial instruments, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
Pension and OPEB CMSEnergy and Consumers provide retirement pension benefits to certain employees under a non-contributory DB Pension Plan, and they provide postretirement health and life benefits to qualifying retired employees under an OPEB Plan.
74 Table of Contents CMSEnergy and Consumers record liabilities for pension and OPEB on their consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the future obligations, net of any plan assets. The calculation of the liabilities and associated expenses requires the expertise of actuaries, and requires many assumptions, including:  life expectancies  discount rates  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases  expected health care costs A change in these assumptions could change significantly CMSEnergys and Consumers recorded liabilities and associated expenses.
In January2016, CMSEnergy and Consumers changed the method in which they determine the discount rate used to calculate the service cost and interest expense components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans. Historically, the discount rate used for this purpose represented a single weighted-average rate derived from the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation. CMSEnergy and Consumers have elected to use instead a full-yield-curve approach in the estimation of service cost and interest expense; this approach is more accurate in that it applies individual spot rates along the yield curve to future projected benefit payments based on the time of payment. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect that this change will result in a decrease in the service cost and interest expense components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans, with an offsetting impact to the actuarial gain or loss recorded in, and later amortized from, the associated regulatory asset and AOCI.
Presented in the following table are estimates of CMSEnergys and Consumers DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan costs (credits) through 2018. Neither CMSEnergy nor Consumers plans to contribute to the DBPension Plan or OPEB Plan through 2018. Actual future costs and contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan participants.
In   Millions DBPension OPEB Plan Plan Cost Cost(Credit) CMSEnergy, including Consumers 2016 $53 $(41) 2017 53 (38) 2018 50 (40) Consumers 1 2016 $52 $(36) 2017 52 (33) 2018 49 (35) 1 Consumers pension and OPEB costs are recoverable through its general ratemaking process.
As a result of the change in the method in which CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the discount rate used to calculate the service cost and interest expense components of net periodic benefit costs, the estimate of DBPension Plan costs decreased by $23million for 2016, $21million for 2017, and $19million for 2018, and the estimate of OPEB Plan costs decreased by $12million for 2016, $11million for 2017, and $10million for 2018.
Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the DBPension Plan assets by 0.25percentage point (from 7.25percent to 7.00percent) would increase estimated DBPension Plan cost for 2016 by $5million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers. Lowering the PBO discount rate by 0.25percentage 75 Table of Contents point (from 4.52percent to 4.27percent) would increase estimated DBPension Plan cost for 2016 by $5million for both CMSEnergy and Consumers.

92 Table of Contents CMSEnergy Corporation Consumers Energy Company Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation: CMSEnergy and Consumers prepare their consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. CMSEnergys co nsolidated financial statements comprise CMSEnergy, Consumers, CMSEnterprises, and all other entities in which CMSEnergy has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Consumers consolidated financial statements comprise Consumers and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy uses the equity method of accounting for investments in companies and partnerships that are not consolidated, where they have significant influence over operations and financial policies but are not the primary beneficiary. CMSEnergy and Consumers eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.
Use of Estimates : CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to make estimates using assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Policy: CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize revenue from deliveries of electricity and natural gas, and from the transportation, processing, and storage of natural gas, when services are provided. CMSEnergy and Consumers record unbilled revenue for the estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. CMSEnergy and Consumers record sales tax net and exclude it from revenue. CMSEnergy recognizes revenue on sales of marketed electricity, natural gas, and other energy products at delivery.
Alternative-Revenue Program: In 2009, the MPSC approved an energy optimization incentive mechanism that provides a financial incentive if the energy savings of Consumers customers exceed annual targets established by the MPSC. The maximum incentive that Consumers may earn under this mechanism is 15percent of the amount it spends on energy optimization programs, which is limited to twopercent of Consumers retail revenue. Consumers accounts for this program as an alternative-revenue program that meets the criteria for recognizing revenue related to the incentive as soon as energy savings exceed the annual targets established by the MPSC.
Self-Implemented Rates: Unless prohibited by the MPSC upon a showing of good cause, Consumers is allowed to self-implement new energy rates six months after a new rate case filing if the MPSC has not issued an order in the case. The MPSC then has another six months to issue a final order. If the MPSC does not issue a final order within that period, the filed rates are considered approved. If the MPSC issues a final order within that period, the rates that Consumers self-implemented may be subject to refund, with interest. Consumers recognizes revenue associated with self-implemented rates. If Consumers considers it probable that it will be required to refund a portion of its self-implemented rates, then Consumers records a provision for revenue subject to refund.
EnerBank: EnerBank provides four types of unsecured consumer installment loans: same-as-cash, zero interest, reduced interest, and traditional. Under EnerBanks same-as-cash programs, authorized contractors pay EnerBank a fee to provide a borrower with the option to pay off the loan interest-free during the same-as-cash period. EnerBank recognizes the fee on a straight-line basis over the same-as-cash period, which typically ranges from three to 24months. If a borrower does not exercise its option to pay off its loan interest-free during the same-as-cash period, EnerBank charges the borrower accrued interest at the loans contractual rate on the outstanding balance from the origination date. Under the zero interest and reduced interest programs, authorized contractors pay EnerBank a fee to provide a borrower 93 Table of Contents with no interest or reduced rates of interest for the entire term of the loan. EnerBank recognizes the fee using the interest method over the term of the loan, which ranges from one to 12years. Unearned income associated with the fees, which is recorded as a reduction to notes receivable on CMS Energys consolidated balance sheets, was $82 million at December 31, 2015 and $62 million at December 31, 2014.
EnerBank recognizes interest income using the interest method and amortizes loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, over the loan term. EnerBank ceases recognizing interest income when a loan loss is confirmed or when a loan becomes 120days past due, at which time the loan principal is charged against the allowance for loan losses. At that time, EnerBank recognizes any interest accrued but not received for such loan losses as a reversal of interest income.
The loan fees and interest income earned by EnerBank are reported as operating revenue on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable comprise trade receivables and unbilled receivables. CMSEnergy and Consumers record their accounts receivable at cost, which approximates fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses, managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. CMSEnergy and Consumers assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms established with customers. CMSEnergy and Consumers charge off accounts deemed uncollectible to operating expense.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Contingencies: CMSEnergy and Consumers record estimated liabilities for contingencies on their consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. CMSEnergy and Consumers expense legal fees as incurred; fees incurred but not yet billed are accrued based on estimates of work performed.
Debt Issuance Costs, Discounts, Premiums, and Refinancing Costs: Upon the issuance of long-term debt, CMSEnergy and Consumers defer issuance costs, discounts, and premiums and amortize those amounts over the terms of the associated debt. Upon the refinancing of long-term debt, Consumers, as a regulated entity, defers any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with the refinanced debt and amortizes those amounts over the term of the newly issued debt. For the non-regulated portions of CMSEnergys business, any remaining unamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premiums associated with extinguished debt are charged to earnings.
Derivative Instruments: In order to support ongoing operations, CMSEnergy and Consumers enter into contracts for the future purchase and sale of various commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, and coal. These forward contracts are generally long-term in nature and result in physical delivery of the commodity at a contracted price. Most of these contracts are not subject to derivative accounting because:  they   do not have a notional amount (that is, a number of units specified in a   derivative instrument, such as MWh of electricity or bcf of natural gas)  they   qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  there   is not an active market for the commodity Consumers coal purchase contracts are not derivatives because there is not an active market for the coal it purchases. If an active market for coal develops in the future, some of these contracts may qualify as derivatives. Since Consumers is subject to regulatory accounting, the resulting fair value gains and losses would be deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities and would not affect net income.
Consumers also uses FTRs to manage price risk related to electricity transmission congestion. An FTR is a financial instrument that entitles its holder to receive compensation or requires its holder to remit payment for congestion-related transmission charges. Consumers accounts for FTRs as derivatives. All 94 Table of Contents changes in fair value associated with FTRs are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities until the instruments are settled.
CMSEnergy and Consumers record derivative contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value on their consolidated balance sheets. Each reporting period, the resulting asset or liability is adjusted to reflect any change in the fair value of the contract. Since none of CMSEnergys or Consumers derivatives has been designated as an accounting hedge, all changes in fair value are either reported in earnings or deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. CMSEnergy and Consumers did not have significant amounts recorded as derivative assets or liabilities at December31,2015 or 2014. Additionally, the gains and losses recognized in earnings were insignificant for the years ended December31,2015, 2014, and 2013.
Determination of MRV of Plan Assets for DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan: CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for DBPension Plan assets as the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date, adjusted by the gains or losses that will not be admitted into the MRV until future years. CMSEnergy and Consumers reflect each years gain or loss in the MRV in equal amounts over a five-year period beginning on the date the original amount was determined. CMSEnergy and Consumers determine the MRV for OPEB Plan assets as the fair value of assets on the measurement date. CMSEnergy and Consumers use the MRV in the calculation of net DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan costs. For further details, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Earnings Per Share: CMSEnergy calculates basic and diluted EPS using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted EPS, includes the effects of nonvested stock awards and contingently convertible securities. CMSEnergy computes the effect on potential common stock using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of antidilutive securities, which are those securities resulting in an increase in EPS or a decrease in loss per share. For EPS computations, see Note15, Earnings Per ShareCMSEnergy.
Financial Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers record debt and equity securities classified as available for sale at fair value as determined from quoted market prices or other observable, market-based inputs. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these securities are determined on a specific-identification basis. CMSEnergy and Consumers report unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of tax, in equity as part of AOCI, except that unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary are reported in earnings. For additional details regarding financial instruments, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments: CMSEnergy and Consumers perform tests of impairment if certain triggering events occur or if there has been a decline in value that may be other than temporary.
CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate long-lived assets held in use for impairment by calculating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of the asset using quoted market prices, market prices of similar assets, or discounted future cash flow analyses.
CMSEnergy also assesses equity method investments for impairment whenever there has been a decline in value that is other than temporary. This assessment requires CMSEnergy to determine the fair value of the equity method investment. CMSEnergy determines fair value using valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, and assesses the ability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment. CMSEnergy records an impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary.
95 Table of Contents Inventory: CMSEnergy and Consumers use the weighted-average cost method for valuing working gas, recoverable base gas in underground storage facilities, and materials and supplies inventory. CMSEnergy and Consumers also use this method for valuing coal inventory, and they classify these amounts as generating plant fuel stock on their consolidated balance sheets.
CMSEnergy and Consumers account for RECs and emission allowances as inventory and use the weighted-average cost method to remove amounts from inventory. RECs and emission allowances are used to satisfy compliance obligations related to the generation of power.
CMSEnergy and Consumers use the lower-of-cost-or-market method to evaluate inventory for impairment.
MISO Transactions: MISO requires the submission of hourly day-ahead and real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. CMSEnergy and Consumers account for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the real-time and day-ahead markets, netted across all MISO energy market locations. CMSEnergy and Consumers record net hourly purchases in purchased and interchange power and net hourly sales in operating revenue on their consolidated statements of income. They record net billing adjustments upon receipt of settlement statements, record accruals for future net purchases and sales adjustments based on historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual expenses and sales upon receipt of settlement statements.
Property Taxes: Property taxes are based on the taxable value of Consumers real and personal property assessed by local taxing authorities. Consumers records property tax expense over the fiscal year of the taxing authority for which the taxes are levied based on Consumers budgeted customer sales. The deferred property tax balance represents the amount of Consumers accrued property tax that will be recognized over future governmental fiscal periods.
Renewable Energy Grant: In 2013, Consumers received a renewable energy cash grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park under Section1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009. Upon receipt of the grant, Consumers recorded a regulatory liability, which Consumers is amortizing over the life of Lake Winds  Energy Park. Consumers presents the amortization as a reduction to maintenance and other operating expenses. Consumers recorded the deferred income taxes related to the grant as a reduction of the book basis of Lake Winds  Energy Park.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents: CMSEnergy and Consumers have restricted cash and cash equivalents dedicated for repayment of Securitization bonds and for payment under performance guarantees. CMSEnergy and Consumers classify these amounts as a current asset if they relate to payments that could or will occur within one year. Changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents are presented as investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
2: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Implementation of New Accounting Standards ASU2015-13, Application of the Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Scope Exception to Certain Electricity Contracts within Nodal Energy Markets: This standard, which became effective in August2015 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, was intended to resolve diversity in practice regarding whether certain electricity contracts are eligible for the normal purchases and sales scope exception from derivative accounting. The standard clarifies that contracts that require transmission of electricity through a market with established price points at each node or hub location are eligible for the scope exception. Consumers applies the normal purchases and sales scope exception to many PPAs that require transmission of electricity through the MISO market, which has price points at various node or hub locations. Since this standard clarifies that these contracts are eligible for the scope exception, which is 96 Table of Contents consistent with Consumers treatment, the standard had no impact on CMSEnergys or Consumers consolidated financial statements.
ASU2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes: This standard eliminates the requirement to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and non-current amounts on a classified balance sheet. Under the standard, all deferred income tax amounts should be classified as non-current. The standard will be effective on January1,2017 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, but early adoption is permitted. The standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. CMSEnergy and Consumers elected to adopt the standard early for the year ended December31,2015 and applied the standard retrospectively to all prior periods. Accordingly, CMSEnergy reclassified $66million of current deferred income tax liabilities to non-current deferred income tax liabilities at December31,2014, and Consumers reclassified $80million of current deferred income tax liabilities to non-current deferred income tax liabilities at December31,2014.
New Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective ASU2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: This standard, which will become effective January1,2018 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, provides new guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. A primary objective of the standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model that will be applied across entities, industries, and capital markets. The new guidance will replace most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in GAAP, although certain guidance specific to rate-regulated utilities will be retained. Entities will have the option to apply the standard retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or to apply it retrospectively only to contracts existing at the effective date, with the cumulative effect of the standard recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. CMSEnergy and Consumers are evaluating the impact of the standard on their consolidated financial statements.
ASU2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period: This standard, effective January1,2016 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, addresses stock awards with performance targets that can be met after an employee has completed the required service period. The standard was intended to resolve diversity in practice regarding the accounting treatment for this type of award. Under the new guidance, the probability of the performance target being met should be factored into compensation expense each period. This guidance is consistent with the accounting that CMSEnergy and Consumers already apply to awards of this type. Therefore, CMSEnergy and Consumers do not expect the standard to impact their consolidated financial statements.
ASU2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis: This standard, effective January1,2016 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, provides amended guidance on whether reporting entities should consolidate certain legal entities, including limited partnerships. CMSEnergy and Consumers have assessed this standard and do not expect that it will result in any changes to their consolidation conclusions or have any impact on their consolidated income, cash flows, or financial position.
ASU2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs: This standard, effective January1,2016 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Presently, debt issuance costs are reported as an asset. The new guidance aligns the presentation of debt issuance costs with debt discounts and premiums. The standard is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. At December31,2015, CMSEnergy had $41million of unamortized debt issuance costs, which included $23million at Consumers. These amounts were recorded in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets, but will be included in the long-term debt balances under this standard.
97 Table of Contents ASU2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: This standard, which will be effective January1,2018 for CMSEnergy and Consumers, is intended to improve the accounting for financial instruments. The standard will require investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income, except for certain investments such as those that qualify for equity-method accounting. The standard will no longer permit unrealized gains and losses for certain equity investments to be recorded in AOCI. CMSEnergy and Consumers presently record unrealized gains and losses on certain equity investments, including the mutual funds in the DBSERP and Consumers investment in CMSEnergy common stock, in AOCI. During the year ended December31,2015, CMSEnergy recorded a $3million unrealized net loss on equity investments in AOCI and Consumers recorded a $1million unrealized net loss on equity investments in AOCI. For further details on these investments, see Note7, Financial Instruments. Entities will apply the standard using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings on the effective date. CMSEnergy and Consumers are evaluating whether there may be further impacts of the standard on their consolidated financial statements.
3: REGULATORY MATTERS Regulatory matters are critical to Consumers. The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers, such as Consumers rate cases and PSCR and GCR processes. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders. Depending upon the specific issues, the outcomes of rate cases and proceedings, including judicial proceedings challenging MPSC orders or other actions, could negatively affect CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
There are multiple appeals pending that involve various issues concerning cost allocation among customers, the adequacy of the record evidence supporting the recovery of Smart Energy investments, and other matters. Consumers is unable to predict the outcome of these appeals.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Consumers is subject to the actions of the MPSC and FERC and therefore prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of regulatory accounting. A utility must apply regulatory accounting when its rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services. Under regulatory accounting, Consumers records regulatory assets or liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as expense or revenue by non-regulated businesses.
98 Table of Contents Presented in the following table are the regulatory assets and liabilities on Consumers consolidated balance sheets: In   Millions December31 EndofRecovery orRefundPeriod 2015 2014 Regulatory assets Current Energy   optimization plan incentive 1 2016 $ 16 $ 17 Securitized   costs  electric utility restructuring legislation 2 2015 - 61 Major   maintenance 2 2015 - 8 Other 2015 - 3 Total current   regulatory assets $ 16 $ 89 Non-current Postretirement   benefits 3 various $ 1,096 $ 1,195 Securitized   costs  electric generating units to be retired 2 2029 348 370 ARO 4 various 151 139 MGP sites 4 various 146 147 Unamortized debt   costs 4 various 61 66 Gas storage   inventory adjustments 4 various 18 21 Energy optimization   plan incentive 1 2017 18 17 Other various 2 1 Total non-current   regulatory assets $ 1,840 $ 1,956 Total regulatory assets $ 1,856 $ 2,045 Regulatory liabilities Current Income taxes,   net 2016 $ 64 $ 64 Securitized   costs  electric utility restructuring legislation 2016 14 - Other 2016 4 3 Total   current regulatory liabilities $ 82 $ 67 Non-current Cost of removal various $ 1,745 $ 1,673 Renewable energy   plan 2028 109 131 ARO various 73 83 Income taxes,   net various 64 103 Renewable energy   grant 2043 60 63 Energy   optimization plan various 26 32 Other various 11 10 Total non-current   regulatory liabilities $ 2,088 $ 2,095 Total regulatory   liabilities $ 2,170 $ 2,162 1 These regulatory assets have arisen from alternative revenue programs and are not associated with incurred costs or capital investments. Therefore, the MPSC has provided for recovery without a return.
2 These regulatory assets are included in rate base (or are expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case), thereby providing a return on expenditures, or provide a specific return on investment authorized by the MPSC.
3 This regulatory asset is offset partially by liabilities. The net amount is included in rate base, thereby providing a return.
4 These regulatory assets represent incurred costs for which the MPSC has provided, or Consumers expects, recovery without a return on investment.
99 Table of Contents Regulatory Assets Energy Optimization Plan Incentive: In May2015, Consumers filed its annual report and reconciliation for its energy optimization plan, requesting approval of its energy optimization plan costs for 2014. In September2015, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to collect $17million from customers during 2016 as an incentive payment for exceeding statutory targets under both its gas and electric energy optimization plans during 2014.
Consumers also exceeded its statutory savings targets in 2015, and achieved certain other goals, and will request the MPSCs approval to collect $18million, the maximum performance incentive, in the energy optimization reconciliation to be filed in 2016.
Securitized Costs  Electric Utility Restructuring Legislation: In 2000, the MPSC authorized Consumers to securitize certain qualified costs incurred as a result of electric utility restructuring legislation. Consumers amortized this regulatory asset over the life of the related Securitization bonds, which were paid in full in October2015. During 2015, Consumers overcollected surcharges related to this Securitization and, as a result, recorded a regulatory liability.
Consumers filed a reconciliation with the MPSC in January2016, requesting to refund this amount to customers in 2016.
Major Maintenance: In its2012 order in Consumers electric rate case, the MPSC allowed Consumers to defer major maintenance costs associated with its electric generating units in excess of the costs approved in the rate order and to recover those excess costs from customers, subject to MPSC approval. In November2014, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing Consumers to recover $10million of such excess costs over a six-month period that ended in May2015.
Postretirement Benefits: As part of the ratemaking process, the MPSC allows Consumers to recover the costs of postretirement benefits. Accordingly, Consumers defers the net impact of actuarial losses and gains as well as prior service costs and credits associated with postretirement benefits as a regulatory asset or liability. The asset or liability will decrease as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
For details about the amortization periods, see Note12, Retirement Benefits.
Securitized Costs  Electric Generating Units to be Retired: In 2013, the MPSC issued a Securitization financing order authorizing Consumers to issue Securitization bonds in order to finance the recovery of the remaining book value of seven smaller coal-fueled electric generating units that Consumers plans to retire by April2016 and three smaller natural gas-fueled electric generating units that Consumers retired in June2015. Upon receipt of the MPSCs order, Consumers removed the book value of the ten units from plant, property, and equipment and recorded this amount as a regulatory asset. Consumers is amortizing the regulatory asset over the life of the related Securitization bonds, which it issued through a subsidiary in July2014. For additional details regarding the Securitization bonds, see Note5, Financings and Capitalization.
ARO: The recovery of the underlying asset investments and related removal and monitoring costs of recorded AROs is approved by the MPSC in depreciation rate cases. Consumers records a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability for timing differences between the recognition of AROs for financial reporting purposes and the recovery of these costs from customers. The recovery period approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed.
MGP Sites: Consumers is incurring environmental remediation and other response activity costs at 23 former MGP facilities. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover from its natural gas customers over a ten-year period the costs incurred to remediate the MGP sites.
Unamortized Debt Costs: Under regulatory accounting, any unamortized debt costs related to debt redeemed with the proceeds of new debt are capitalized and amortized over the life of the new debt.
100 Table of Contents Gas Storage Inventory Adjustments: Consumers incurs inventory expenses related to the loss of gas from its natural gas storage fields. The MPSC allows Consumers to recover these costs from its natural gas customers over a five-year period.
Regulatory Liabilities Income Taxes, Net: These costs represent the difference between deferred income taxes recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts previously reflected in Consumers rates. This net balance will decrease over the remaining life of the related temporary differences and flow through current income tax benefit.
In2013, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to accelerate the flow-through to electric and gas customers of certain income tax benefits associated primarily with the cost of removal of plant placed in service before 1993. The order authorized Consumers to implement a regulatory treatment beginning January2014 that will return $209million of income tax benefits over fiveyears to electric customers and $260million of income tax benefits over 12years to gas customers. During 2015, Consumers returned $64million of income tax benefits to customers.
Cost of Removal: These amounts have been collected from customers to fund future asset removal activities.
This regulatory liability is reduced as costs of removal are incurred. The refund period of this regulatory liability approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed.
Renewable Energy Plan: Consumers has collected surcharges to fund its renewable energy plan. Amounts not yet spent under the plan are recorded as a regulatory liability, which is amortized as incremental costs are incurred to operate and depreciate Consumers wind parks and to purchase RECs under renewable energy purchase agreements. Incremental costs represent costs incurred in excess of amounts recovered through the PSCR process.
Renewable Energy Grant: In2013, Consumers received a $69million renewable energy grant for Lake Winds  Energy Park, which began operations in2012. This grant reduces Consumers cost of complying with the renewable portfolio standards prescribed by the 2008 Energy Law and, accordingly, reduces the overall renewable energy surcharge to be collected from customers. The regulatory liability recorded for the grant will be amortized over the life of Lake Winds  Energy Park.
Energy Optimization Plan: At December31,2015 and 2014, surcharges collected from customers to fund Consumers energy optimization plan exceeded Consumers spending. The associated regulatory liability is amortized as costs are incurred under Consumers energy optimization plan.
Consumers Electric Utility Electric Rate Case: In December2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $163million, based on a 10.7percent authorized return on equity. The MPSC issued an order in November2015, authorizing an annual rate increase of $165million, based on a 10.3percent authorized rate of return on equity. In April2016, upon the planned retirement of seven coal-fueled electric generating units, the annual rate increase will be reduced by $39million to $126million.
In June2015, Consumers self-implemented an annual rate increase of $110million, subject to refund with interest. Consumers does not expect that a significant refund of self-implemented rates will be required.
Electric Rate Design: In June2015, the MPSC issued an order on Consumers proposal for a new electric rate design, authorizing a reallocation of annual costs among customer classes. This new allocation will better ensure that rates reflect the cost of service for each customer class and will have the 101 Table of Contents effect of making rates for energy-intensive industrial customers more competitive, while keeping residential bills below the national average. In December2015, the new rate design went into effect.
Depreciation Rate Case: In June2014, Consumers filed a depreciation case related to its electric and common utility property. In this case, Consumers requested an increase in depreciation expense, and its recovery of that expense, of $28million annually. In May2015, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing an increase in Consumers depreciation expense, and its recovery of that expense, of $6million annually based on December31,2013 balances. In December2015, the new depreciation rates went into effect.
Consumers Gas Utility Gas Rate Case: In July2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC seeking an annual rate increase of $88million. The filing requested authority to recover new investments that will allow Consumers to improve system reliability, comply with regulations, and enhance technology.
In January2015, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement authorizing a $45million annual rate increase, based on a 10.3percent authorized return on equity. This was Consumers first gas base rate increase since 2012.
Power Supply Cost Recovery and Gas Cost Recovery The PSCR and GCR ratemaking processes are designed to allow Consumers to recover all of its power supply and purchased natural gas costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices in annual plan and reconciliation proceedings. Consumers adjusts its PSCR and GCR billing charges monthly in order to minimize the underrecovery or overrecovery amount in the annual reconciliations.
Underrecoveries represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from customers and are included in accrued gas revenue on Consumers consolidated balance sheets. Overrecoveries represent previously collected revenues that will be refunded to customers and are included in accrued rate refunds on Consumers consolidated balance sheets. Presented in the following table are the assets and liabilities for PSCR and GCR underrecoveries and overrecoveries reflected on Consumers consolidated balance sheets: In Millions December31 2015 2014 Assets Accrued gas   revenue $- $27 Liabilities Accrued rate   refunds 26 6 PSCR Plans and Reconciliations: In May2015, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2013PSCR plan, authorizing the 2013 PSCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in January2013. Consumers filed its 2013PSCR reconciliation in March2014, requesting full recovery of $1.9billion of power costs and authorization to roll into its 2014PSCR plan the overrecovery of $10million.
Consumers submitted its 2014 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2013 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2014PSCR factor beginning in January2014. Consumers power supply costs for 2014 were significantly higher than those projected in its 2014 PSCR plan due to severe winter weather during the three months ended March31,2014, as extreme cold weather and heavy snowfall inhibited the delivery and use of coal at Consumers coal-fueled generating units. Additionally, increases in natural gas prices raised the cost of electricity purchased from the MISO energy market as 102 Table of Contents well as the cost of power generated at Consumers natural gas-fueled generating units. Consumers filed an amendment to its 2014PSCR plan in March2014, requesting approval to increase the 2014PSCR factor. Consumers self-implemented the revised factor in July2014. In March2015, Consumers filed its 2014PSCR reconciliation, requesting full recovery of $2.1billion of power costs and authorization to roll into its 2015PSCR plan the overrecovery of $6million.
Consumers submitted its 2015 PSCR plan to the MPSC in September2014 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2015PSCR factor beginning in January2015. Consumers had an $8million PSCR overrecovery at December31,2015.
GCR Plans and Reconciliations: In July2014, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2013-2014GCR plan, authorizing the 2013-2014 GCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in April2013. Due to the impact on natural gas prices of extended periods of colder-than-normal winter weather in Michigan and throughout the United States during the three months ended March31,2014, Consumers natural gas fuel costs for this period were significantly higher than those projected in its 2013-2014 GCR plan. As a result, Consumers calculated an $84million underrecovery for the 2013-2014 GCR plan year. In the reconciliation it filed in June2014, Consumers requested full recovery of $0.9billion of gas costs and authorization to roll into its 2014-2015GCR plan the underrecovery of $84million.
In June2015, the MPSC issued an order in Consumers 2014-2015GCR plan, authorizing the 2014-2015 GCR factor that Consumers self-implemented beginning in April2014. Consumers filed its 2014-2015GCR reconciliation in June2015, requesting full recovery of $0.8billion of gas costs and authorization to roll into its 2015-2016GCR plan the overrecovery of $9million.
Consumers submitted its 2015-2016 GCR plan to the MPSC in December2014 and, in accordance with its proposed plan, self-implemented the 2015-2016 GCR charge beginning in April2015. Consumers had an $18million GCR overrecovery recorded at December31,2015.
4: CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS CMSEnergy and Consumers are involved in various matters that give rise to contingent liabilities. Depending on the specific issues, the resolution of these contingencies could negatively affect CMSEnergys and Consumers liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In their disclosures of these matters, CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss when such an estimate can be made. Disclosures that state that CMSEnergy or Consumers cannot predict the outcome of a matter indicate that they are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss for the matter.
CMSEnergy Contingencies Gas Index Price Reporting Litigation: CMSEnergy, along with CMSMST, CMSField Services, Cantera Natural Gas, Inc., and Cantera Gas Company, have been named as defendants in four class action lawsuits and one individual lawsuit arising as a result of alleged inaccurate natural gas price reporting to publications that report trade information. Allegations include price-fixing conspiracies, restraint of trade, and artificial inflation of natural gas retail prices in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The following provides more detail on the cases in which CMSEnergy or its affiliates remain as parties:  In 2005, CMSEnergy, CMSMST, and CMSField Services were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in Kansas state court, Learjet,Inc., etal. v. Oneok,Inc., etal. The complaint alleges that during the putative class period, January1,2000 through October31,2002, the defendants engaged in a scheme to violate the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, statutory full consideration damages consisting of the full 103 Table of Contents consideration paid by the plaintiffs for natural gas purchased during the period, costs, and attorneys fees.
In 2007, a class action complaint, Heartland Regional Medical Center, etal. v. Oneok,Inc. etal., was filed as a putative class action in Missouri state court alleging violations of Missouri antitrust laws. The defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSField Services, and CMSMST, are alleged to have violated the Missouri antitrust law in connection with their natural gas reporting activities during the period January2000 through October2002. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, costs, and attorneys fees.
In 2006, a class action complaint, ArandellCorp., etal. v. XCELEnergyInc., etal., was filed in Wisconsin state court on behalf of Wisconsin commercial entities that purchased natural gas between January1,2000 and October31,2002. The defendants, including CMSEnergy, CMSERM, and Cantera Gas Company, are alleged to have violated Wisconsins antitrust statute. The plaintiffs are seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs, interest, and attorneys fees.
In 2009, a class action complaint, NewpageWisconsin System v. CMSERM, etal., was filed in circuit court in Wood County, Wisconsin, against CMSEnergy, CMSERM, Cantera Gas Company, and others. The plaintiff is seeking full consideration damages, treble damages, costs, interest, and attorneys fees.
In 2005, J.P.Morgan Trust Company,N.A., in its capacity as trustee of the FLILiquidating Trust, filed an action in Kansas state court against CMSEnergy, CMSMST, CMSField Services, and others. The complaint alleges various claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act. The plaintiff is seeking statutory full consideration damages for its purchases of natural gas in 2000 and 2001, costs, and attorneys fees.
After removal to federal court, all of the cases described above were transferred to a single federal district court pursuant to the multidistrict litigation process. In 2010 and 2011, all claims against CMSEnergy defendants were dismissed by the district court based on FERC preemption. Plaintiffs filed appeals in all of the cases. The issues on appeal were whether the district court erred in dismissing the cases based on FERC preemption and denying the plaintiffs motions for leave to amend their complaints to add a federal Sherman Act antitrust claim. The plaintiffs did not appeal the dismissal of CMSEnergy as a defendant in these cases, but other CMSEnergy entities remain as defendants.
In 2013, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court decision. The appellate court found that FERC preemption does not apply under the facts of these cases. The appellate court affirmed the district courts denial of leave to amend to add federal antitrust claims. The matter was appealed to the U.S.Supreme Court, which in 2015 upheld the Ninth Circuits decision. The cases have been remanded back to the federal district court.
These cases involve complex facts, a large number of similarly situated defendants with different factual positions, and multiple jurisdictions. Presently, any estimate of liability would be highly speculative; the amount of CMSEnergys reasonably possible loss would be based on widely varying models previously untested in this context. If the outcome after appeals is unfavorable, these cases could negatively affect CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Bay Harbor: CMSLand retained environmental remediation obligations for the collection and treatment of leachate, a liquid consisting of water and other substances, at Bay Harbor after selling its interests in the development in 2002. Leachate is produced when water enters into cement kiln dust piles left over from former cement plant operations at the site. In 2012, CMSLand and the MDEQ finalized an agreement that established the final remedies and the future water quality criteria at the site. CMSLand completed all construction necessary to implement the remedies required by the agreement and will 104 Table of Contents continue to maintain and operate a system to discharge treated leachate into Little Traverse Bay under an NPDES permit issued in 2010. CMSLand is presently working with the MDEQ to renew this permit, which requires renewal every fiveyears. Until a new permit is issued, CMSLand is authorized to continue operating under the existing permit.
Various claims have been brought against CMSLand or its affiliates, including CMSEnergy, alleging environmental damage to property, loss of property value, insufficient disclosure of environmental matters, breach of agreement relating to access, or other matters. CMSLand and other parties have received a demand for payment from the EPA in the amount of $8million, plus interest. The EPA is seeking recovery under CERCLA of response costs allegedly incurred at Bay Harbor. These costs exceed what was agreed to in a 2005 order between CMSLand and the EPA, and CMSLand has communicated to the EPA that it does not believe that this is a valid claim. The EPA has filed a lawsuit to collect these costs.
At December31,2015, CMSEnergy had a recorded liability of $58million for its remaining obligations. CMS Energy calculated this liability based on discounted projected costs, using a discount rate of 4.34percent and an inflation rate of onepercent on annual operating and maintenance costs. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $74million. CMSEnergy expects to pay the following amounts for long-term liquid disposal and operating and maintenance in each of the next fiveyears: In Millions 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 CMS   Energy Long-term liquid   disposal and operating and maintenance costs $6 $5 $5 $5 $4 CMSEnergys estimate of response activity costs and the timing of expenditures could change if there are changes in circumstances or assumptions used in calculating the liability. Although a liability for its present estimate of remaining response activity costs has been recorded, CMSEnergy cannot predict the ultimate financial impact or outcome of this matter.
Equatorial Guinea Tax Claim: In 2002, CMSEnergy sold its oil, gas, and methanol investments in Equatorial Guinea. The government of Equatorial Guinea claims that CMSEnergy owes $152million in taxes, plus significant penalties and interest, in connection with the sale. The matter is proceeding to formal arbitration. CMSEnergy has concluded that the governments tax claim is without merit and is contesting the claim, but cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of the matter. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on CMSEnergys liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
Consumers Electric Utility Contingencies Electric Environmental Matters: Consumers operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Historically, Consumers has generally been able to recover, in customer rates, the costs to operate its facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations.
Cleanup and Solid Waste: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under the NREPA. Consumers believes that these costs should be recoverable in rates, but cannot guarantee that outcome. Consumers estimates that its liability for NREPA sites for which it can estimate a range of loss will be between $3million and $5million. At December31,2015, Consumers had a recorded liability of $3million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable NREPA liability.
Consumers is a potentially responsible party at a number of contaminated sites administered under CERCLA. CERCLA liability is joint and several. In 2010, Consumers received official notification from 105 Table of Contents the EPA that identified Consumers as a potentially responsible party for cleanup of PCBs at the Kalamazoo River CERCLA site. The notification claimed that the EPA has reason to believe that Consumers disposed of PCBs and arranged for the disposal and treatment of PCB-containing materials at portions of the site. In 2011, Consumers received a follow-up letter from the EPA requesting that Consumers agree to participate in a removal action plan along with several other companies for an area of lower Portage Creek, which is connected to the Kalamazoo River. All parties, including Consumers, that were asked to participate in the removal action plan declined to accept liability. Until further information is received from the EPA, Consumers is unable to estimate a range of potential liability for cleanup of the river.
Based on its experience, Consumers estimates that its share of the total liability for known CERCLA sites will be between $3million and $8million. Various factors, including the number of potentially responsible parties involved with each site, affect Consumers share of the total liability. At December31,2015, Consumers had a recorded liability of $3million for its share of the total liability at these sites, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable CERCLA liability.
The timing of payments related to Consumers remediation and other response activities at its CERCLA and NREPA sites is uncertain. Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. A change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, different remediation techniques, the nature and extent of contamination, and legal and regulatory requirements, could affect its estimates of NREPA and CERCLA liability.
Ludington PCB: In 1998, during routine maintenance activities, Consumers identified PCB as a component in certain paint, grout, and sealant materials at Ludington. Consumers removed part of the PCB material and replaced it with non-PCB material. Consumers has had several communications with the EPA regarding this matter. Consumers cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter.
CCRs: In April2015, the EPA published a final ruleregulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In September2015, the MDEQ submitted a draft plan to the EPA in which it declared its intent to explicitly regulate these facilities under state laws, and the EPA responded, confirming that it agreed with the MDEQs regulatory approach. Accordingly, Consumers recorded a $68million increase to its coal ash disposal ARO liability and a corresponding increase to plant, property, and equipment that will be amortized over the remaining lives of the facilities. For additional details on the ARO liability, see Note11, Asset Retirement Obligations.
Consumers Gas Utility Contingencies Gas Environmental Matters: Consumers expects to incur remediation and other response activity costs at a number of sites under the NREPA. These sites include 23former MGP facilities. Consumers operated the facilities on these sites for some part of their operating lives. For some of these sites, Consumers has no present ownership interest or may own only a portion of the original site.
At December31,2015, Consumers had a recorded liability of $114million for its remaining obligations for these sites. This amount represents the present value of long-term projected costs, using a discount rate of 2.57percent and an inflation rate of 2.5percent. The undiscounted amount of the remaining obligation is $129million. Consumers expects to pay the following amounts for remediation and other response activity costs in each of the next fiveyears: In Millions 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Consumers Remediation and   other response activity costs $14 $19 $11 $14 $19 106 Table of Contents Consumers periodically reviews these cost estimates. Any significant change in the underlying assumptions, such as an increase in the number of sites, changes in remediation techniques, or legal and regulatory requirements, could affect Consumers estimates of annual response activity costs and the MGP liability. At one of the MGP sites, Consumers is waiting for a local agency to make certain decisions on work being carried out adjacent to the site. Depending on the outcome, the agencys decisions could impact Consumers remediation strategy and result in an increase in its cost estimates in 2016.
Pursuant to orders issued by the MPSC, Consumers defers its MGP-related remediation costs and recovers them from its customers over a ten-year period. At December31,2015, Consumers had a regulatory asset of $146million related to the MGP sites.
Consumers estimates that its liability to perform remediation and other response activities at NREPA sites other than the MGP sites could reach $3million. At December31,2015, Consumers had a recorded liability of less than $1million, the minimum amount in the range of its estimated probable liability.
Guarantees Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers guarantees at December31,2015: In   Millions Maximum Carrying Guarantee   Description Issue Date Expiration Date Obligation Amount CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Indemnity   obligations from stock and asset sale agreements 1 Various Indefinite $ 143 $ 7 Guarantees 2 Various Indefinite 51 - Consumers Guarantee 2 July2011 Indefinite $ 30 $ - 1 These obligations arose from stock and asset sale agreements under which CMSEnergy or a subsidiary of CMSEnergy indemnified the purchaser for losses resulting from various matters, primarily claims related to taxes. CMSEnergy believes the likelihood of material loss to be remote for the indemnity obligations not recorded as liabilities.
2 At Consumers, this obligation comprises a guarantee provided to the DOE in connection with a settlement agreement regarding damages resulting from the DOEs failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants formerly owned by Consumers. At CMSEnergy, the guarantee obligations comprise Consumers guarantee to the DOE and CMSEnergys 1994 guarantee of non-recourse revenue bonds issued by Genesee. For additional details on this guarantee, see Note19, Variable Interest Entities.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMSEnergy have entered into various agreements containing tax and other indemnity provisions for which they are unable to estimate the maximum potential obligation. The current carrying value of these indemnity obligations is less than $1million. CMSEnergy and Consumers consider the likelihood that they would be required to perform or incur substantial losses related to these indemnities to be remote.
Other Contingencies Michigan Sales and Use Tax Litigation: In 2010, the Michigan Department of Treasury finalized a sales and use tax audit of Consumers for the period from October1997 to December2004. It determined that Consumers electric and natural gas distribution equipment was not eligible for an industrial-processing exemption and therefore was subject to the use tax. Consumers paid the tax for the period from 1997 107 Table of Contents through 2004 and filed a claim in the Michigan Court of Claims disputing the tax determination. Consumers has continued to apply the industrial-processing exemption for the years subsequent to 2004.
In December2015, Consumers and the Michigan Department of Treasury reached a settlement agreement under which the Michigan Department of Treasury will refund to Consumers the majority of use tax that Consumers paid on electric distribution equipment for the period from October1997 through December2004. Accordingly, Consumers will receive $37million, which comprises a $19million refund of taxes paid, a $12million refund of interest paid, and $6million of interest owed to Consumers. In December2015, Consumers recorded a $12million reduction in other interest expense and $6million in interest income. The taxes paid were originally capitalized as a cost of the equipment. Therefore, Consumers recorded the $19million tax refund as a reduction in plant, property, and equipment. Consumers also recorded an additional $5million reduction in general taxes for the elimination of a loss contingency previously recorded for this matter.
The parties further agreed to continue to meet to reach agreement on a reasonable method of apportionment relating to Consumers natural gas system for the period from October1997 to December2004 and to Consumers electric and natural gas distribution equipment for the period from January2005 to December2014.
Other: In addition to the matters disclosed in this Note and Note3, Regulatory Matters, there are certain other lawsuits and administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies arising in the ordinary course of business to which CMSEnergy, Consumers, and certain other subsidiaries of CMSEnergy are parties. These other lawsuits and proceedings may involve personal injury, property damage, contracts, environmental matters, federal and state taxes, rates, licensing, employment, and other matters. Further, CMSEnergy and Consumers occasionally self-report certain regulatory non-compliance matters that may or may not eventually result in administrative proceedings. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that the outcome of any one of these proceedings will not have a material negative effect on their consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
Contractual Commitments Purchase Obligations: Purchase obligations arise from long-term contracts for the purchase of commodities and related services, and construction and service agreements. The commodities and related services include long-term PPAs, natural gas and associated transportation, and coal and associated transportation. Related party PPAs are between Consumers and certain affiliates of CMSEnterprises.

Palisades PPA: Consumers has a PPA expiring in 2022 with Entergy to purchase all of the capacity and energy produced by Palisades, up to the annual average capacity of 798MW. For all delivered energy, the Palisades PPA has escalating capacity and variable energy charges. Total capacity and energy charges under the Palisades PPA were $352million in 2015, $302million in 2014, and $338million in 2013.
For further details about Palisades, see Note10, Leases.
Other PPAs: Consumers has PPAs expiring between 2016 and 2036 with various counterparties. The majority of the PPAs have capacity and energy charges for delivered energy. Capacity and energy charges under these PPAs were $347million in 2015, $354million in 2014, and $345million in 2013.

Consumers ability to issue FMBs is restricted by certain provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture and the need for regulatory approvals under federal law. Restrictive issuance provisions in the First Mortgage Bond Indenture include achieving a two-times interest coverage ratio and having sufficient unfunded net property additions.
Regulatory Authorization for Financings: Consumers is required to maintain FERC authorization for financings. In June2014, Consumers received authorization from FERC to have outstanding, at any one time, up to $800million of secured and unsecured short-term securities for general corporate purposes. At December31,2015, Consumers had entered into short-term borrowing programs allowing it to issue up to $800million in short-term securities; $249million of securities were outstanding under these programs. FERC has also authorized Consumers to issue and sell up to $1.9billion of secured and unsecured long-term securities for general corporate purposes. The remaining availability was $900million at December31,2015. The authorizations were effective July1,2014 and terminate June30,2016. Any long-term issuances during the authorization period are exempt from FERCs competitive bidding and negotiated placement requirements.
Securitization Bonds: Certain regulatory assets held by Consumers subsidiary, Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding, collateralize Consumers Securitization bonds. The bondholders have no recourse to Consumers assets except for those held by the subsidiary that issued the bonds. Consumers collects Securitization surcharges to cover the principal and interest on the bonds as well as certain other qualified costs. The surcharges collected are remitted to a trustee and are not available to creditors of Consumers or creditors of Consumers affiliates other than the subsidiary that issued the bonds.
Debt Maturities: At December31,2015, the aggregate annual contractual maturities for long-term debt for the next fiveyears were: In   Millions 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Long-term debt $ 684 $ 1,010 $ 911 $ 1,288 $ 801 Consumers Long-term debt $ 198 $ 375 $ 523 $ 876 $ 426 112 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facilities: The following secured revolving credit facilities with banks were available at December31,2015: In Millions Amount of Amount Letters of Credit Amount Expiration Date Facility Borrowed Outstanding Available CMSEnergy   parent May27,2020 1 $ 550 $ - $ 1 $ 549 Consumers May27,2020 2 $ 650 $ - $ 9 $ 641 November23,2017 2,3 250 - - 250 May9,2018 2 30 - 30 - 1 Obligations under this facility are secured by Consumers common stock.
2 Obligations under this facility are secured by FMBs of Consumers.
3 In November2015, Consumers entered into a new $250million credit facility and terminated its $250million accounts receivable sales program.
Short-term Borrowings: Under Consumers commercial paper program, Consumers may issue, in one or more placements, commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 365 days and that bear interest at fixed or floating rates. These issuances are supported by Consumers $650million revolving credit facility and may have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of up to $500million. While the amount of outstanding commercial paper does not reduce the revolvers available capacity, Consumers would not issue commercial paper in an amount exceeding the available revolver capacity. At December31,2015, $249million of commercial paper notes with a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.91percent was outstanding under this program.
Dividend Restrictions: At December31,2015, payment of dividends by CMSEnergy on its common stock was limited to $3.9billion under provisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act of 1972.
Under the provisions of its articles of incorporation, at December31,2015, Consumers had $884million of unrestricted retained earnings available to pay dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy. Provisions of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act appear to restrict dividends payable by Consumers to the amount of Consumers retained earnings. Several decisions from FERC suggest that under a variety of circumstances dividends from Consumers on its common stock would not be limited to amounts in Consumers retained earnings. Any decision by Consumers to pay dividends on its common stock in excess of retained earnings would be based on specific facts and circumstances and would be subject to a formal regulatory filing process.
For the year ended December31,2015, Consumers paid $474million in dividends on its common stock to CMSEnergy.
Capitalization: The authorized capital stock of CMSEnergy consists of:  350million shares of CMSEnergy Common Stock, par value $0.01per share  10million shares of CMSEnergy Preferred Stock, par value $0.01per share Issuance of Common Stock: In April2015, CMSEnergy entered into an updated continuous equity offering program permitting it to sell, from time to time in at the market offerings, common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100million. In2015, CMSEnergy issued 888,610shares of common stock at an average price of $33.76 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $30million.

When measuring fair value, CMSEnergy and Consumers are required to incorporate all assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs used to measure fair value according to their observability in the market. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  Level1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2 inputs are observable, market-based inputs, other than Level1 prices. Level2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in inactive markets, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect CMSEnergys or Consumers own assumptions about how market participants would value their assets and liabilities.
To the extent possible, CMSEnergy and Consumers use quoted market prices or other observable market pricing data in valuing assets and liabilities measured at fair value. If this information is unavailable, they use market-corroborated data or reasonable estimates about market participant assumptions. CMSEnergy and Consumers classify fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
114 Table of Contents Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys and Consumers assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis: InMillions CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Consumers December31 2015 2014 2015 2014 Assets 1 Cash   equivalents $ 158 $ 110 $ - $ 19 Restricted   cash equivalents 19 38 19 38 CMSEnergy   common stock - - 29 38 Nonqualified   deferred compensation plan assets 10 8 7 6 DB SERP Cash equivalents 2 4 2 3 Mutual funds 146 127 104 90 Derivative instruments Commodity   contracts 1 2 1 2 Total $ 336 $ 289 $ 162 $ 196 Liabilities 1 Nonqualified   deferred compensation plan liabilities $ 10 $ 8 $ 7 $ 6 Derivative instruments Commodity   contracts - 1 - 1 Total $ 10 $ 9 $ 7 $ 7 1 All assets and liabilities were classified as Level1 with the exception of some commodity contracts, which were classified as Level3 and which were insignificant at December31,2015 and 2014.
Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents consist of money market funds with daily liquidity.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities: The nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets consist of mutual funds, which are valued using the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund. CMSEnergy and Consumers value their nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities based on the fair values of the plan assets, as they reflect what is owed to the plan participants in accordance with their investment elections. CMSEnergy and Consumers report the assets in other non-current assets and the liabilities in other non-current liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets.
DBSERP Assets: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their DBSERP assets using a market approach that incorporates quoted market prices. The DBSERP cash equivalents consist of a money market fund with daily liquidity. The DBSERP invests in mutual funds that hold primarily fixed-income instruments of varying maturities. In order to meet their investment objectives, the funds hold investment-grade debt securities, and may invest a portion of their assets in high-yield securities, foreign debt, and derivative instruments. CMSEnergy and Consumers value these funds using the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in each fund. CMSEnergy and Consumers report their DBSERP assets in other non-current assets on their consolidated balance sheets. For additional details about DBSERP securities, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
Derivative Instruments: CMSEnergy and Consumers value their derivative instruments using either a market approach that incorporates information from market transactions, or an income approach that discounts future expected cash flows to a present value amount. CMSEnergy values its exchange-traded 115 Table of Contents derivative contracts based on Level1 quoted prices. CMSEnergys and Consumers remaining derivatives are classified as Level3 since the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions.
The majority of derivatives classified as Level3 are FTRs held by Consumers. Due to the lack of quoted pricing information, Consumers determines the fair value of its FTRs based on Consumers average historical settlements.

The table does not include information on cash, cash equivalents, short-term accounts and notes receivable, short-term investments, and current liabilities since the carrying amounts of these items approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. For information about assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and for additional details regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note6, Fair Value Measurements.

4 Includes current portion of long-term debt of $198million at December31,2015 and $124million at December31,2014.
Notes receivable consist of EnerBanks fixed-rate installment loans. EnerBank estimates the fair value of these loans using a discounted cash flows technique that incorporates market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining life of the loans and credit risk.
CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the fair value of their long-term debt using quoted prices from market trades of the debt, if available. In the absence of quoted prices, CMSEnergy and Consumers calculate market yields and prices for the debt using a matrix method that incorporates market data for similarly rated debt. Depending on the information available, other valuation techniques and models may be used that rely on assumptions that cannot be observed or confirmed through market transactions.
The effects of third-party credit enhancements are excluded from the fair value measurements of long-term debt. At December31,2015 and 2014, CMSEnergys long-term debt included $103million principal amount that was supported by third-party credit enhancements. This entire principal amount was at Consumers.

Presented in the following table is a summary of the sales activity for CMSEnergys and Consumers investment securities: In Millions Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Proceeds from   sales of investment securities $ 3 $ 8 $ 3 Consumers Proceeds from   sales of investment securities $ 2 $ 6 $ 2 The sales proceeds for all periods represent sales of investments that were held within the DBSERP and classified as available for sale. Realized gains and losses on the sales were insignificant for CMSEnergy and Consumers during each period.
Consumers recognized gains of $9million in 2015 and $4million in 2013 from transferring shares of CMSEnergy common stock to a related charitable foundation. The gains reflected the excess of fair value over cost of the stock donated and were recorded in other income on Consumers consolidated statements of income. The gains were eliminated on CMSEnergys consolidated statements of income.
118 Table of Contents 8: NOTES RECEIVABLE Presented in the following table are details of CMSEnergys current and non-current notes receivable: In   Millions December31 2015 2014 CMS Energy, including Consumers Current EnerBank notes   receivable, net of allowance for loan losses $ 128 $ 97 EnerBank notes   receivable held for sale 16 41 Other - 1 Non-current EnerBank notes   receivable 1,017 800 Total notes receivable $ 1,161 $ 939 EnerBank notes receivable are unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBank records its notes receivable at cost, less allowance for loan losses. In May2015, EnerBank completed a sale of notes receivable, receiving proceeds of $48million and recording an insignificant gain. At December31,2015, $16million of notes receivable were classified as held for sale; the fair value of notes receivable held for sale exceeded their carrying value. These notes are expected to be sold in 2016.
The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance to reflect estimated credit losses. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries. Management estimates the allowance balance required by taking into consideration historical loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, economic conditions, and other factors. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the loss is confirmed, but no later than the point at which a loan becomes 120days past due.
Presented in the following table are the changes in the allowance for loan losses: In   Millions Years Ended   December31 2015 2014 Balance   at beginning of period $ 8 $ 5 Charge-offs (8 ) (6 ) Recoveries 1 1 Provision for loan   losses 8 8 Balance at end of   period $ 9 $ 8 Loans that are 30days or more past due are considered delinquent. The balance of EnerBanks delinquent consumer loans was $8million at December31,2015 and $5million at December31,2014.
At December31,2015 and 2014, $1million of EnerBanks loans had been modified as troubled debt restructurings.

2 For the year ended December31,2015, utility plant additions were $1.4billion and utility plant retirements were $187million. For the year ended December31,2014, utility plant additions were $1.6billion and utility plant retirements were $126million.
Capitalization: CMSEnergy and Consumers record plant, property, and equipment at original cost when placed into service. The cost includes labor, material, applicable taxes, overhead such as pension and 120 Table of Contents other benefits, and AFUDC, if applicable. Consumers plant, property, and equipment is generally recoverable through its general rate making process.
With the exception of utility property for which the remaining book value has been securitized, mothballed utility property stays in rate base and continues to be depreciated at the same rate as before the mothball period. When utility property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, Consumers records the original cost to accumulated depreciation, along with associated cost of removal, net of salvage. CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of non-regulated assets in income. Consumers records cost of removal collected from customers, but not spent, as a regulatory liability.
Software : CMSEnergy and Consumers capitalize the costs to purchase and develop internal-use computer software. These costs are expensed evenly over the estimated useful life of the internal-use computer software. If computer software is integral to computer hardware, then its cost is capitalized and depreciated with the hardware.
AFUDC : Consumers capitalizes AFUDC on regulated major construction projects, except pollution control facilities on its fossil-fuel-fired power plants. AFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt and authorized return-on-equity funds used to finance construction additions. Consumers records the offsetting credit as a reduction of interest for the amount representing the borrowed funds component and as other income for the equity funds component on the consolidated statements of income. When construction is completed and the property is placed in service, Consumers depreciates and recovers the capitalized AFUDC from customers over the life of the related asset. Presented in the following table are Consumers composite AFUDC capitalization rates: Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 AFUDC   capitalization rate 7.1 % 7.2 % 7.3 % Electric Plant Purchase: In December2015, Consumers completed the purchase of a 540-MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant located in Jackson, Michigan for $155million from AlphaGen PowerLLC and DPC Juniper,LLC, affiliates of JPMorgan Chase&Co. Consumers purchased the plant to help address its future capacity requirements.
Consumers accounted for the purchase as a business combination and prepared a valuation analysis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to determine their fair values. The cash consideration of $155million was allocated based on the underlying fair values of the assets acquired, which were primarily plant, property, and equipment, and the liabilities assumed. No goodwill was recorded as a result of this purchase. The pro forma results of operations have not been presented, as the effects of the acquisition would not have been material to CMSEnergys or Consumers consolidated results of operations in 2015.

123 Table of Contents 10: LEASES CMSEnergy and Consumers lease various assets, including railcars, service vehicles, gas pipeline capacity, and buildings. In addition, CMSEnergy and Consumers account for a number of their PPAs as capital and operating leases.
Operating leases for coal-carrying railcars have original lease terms ranging from one to 15years, expiring without extension provisions over the next tenyears and with extension provisions over the next 11years. These leases contain fair market value extension and buyout provisions. Capital leases for Consumers vehicle fleet operations have a maximum term of 120months with some having end-of-lease rental adjustment clauses based on the proceeds received from the sale or disposition of the vehicles, and others having fixedpercentage purchase options.
Consumers has capital leases for gas transportation pipelines to the D.E.Karn generating complex and Zeeland. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline into the D.E.Karn generating complex has a term of 15years with a provision to extend the contract from month to month. The remaining term of the contract was sixyears at December31,2015. The capital lease for the gas transportation pipeline to Zeeland has a term of fiveyears with a renewal provision of an additional fiveyears at the end of the contract. The remaining term of the contract was twoyears at December31,2015. The remaining terms of Consumers long-term PPAs accounted for as leases range between one and 17years. Most of these PPAs contain provisions at the end of the initial contract terms to renew the agreements annually.

Consumers has continuing involvement with Palisades through security provided to Entergy for Consumers PPA obligation and other arrangements. Because of these ongoing arrangements, Consumers accounted for the transaction as a financing of Palisades and not a sale. Accordingly, no gain on the sale of Palisades was recognized on the consolidated statements of income. Consumers accounted for the remaining non-real-estate assets and liabilities associated with the transaction as a sale.
Palisades remains on Consumers consolidated balance sheets and Consumers continues to depreciate it. Consumers recorded the related proceeds as a financing obligation with payments recorded to interest expense and the financing obligation based on the amortization of the obligation over the life of the Palisades PPA. The value of the financing obligation was determined based on an allocation of the transaction proceeds to the fair values of the net assets sold and fair value of the plant asset under the financing. Total amortization and interest charges under the financing were $18million for the year ended December31,2015, $19million for the year ended December31,2014, and $20million for the year ended December31,2013.
11: ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS CMSEnergy and Consumers record the fair value of the cost to remove assets at the end of their useful lives, if there is a legal obligation to remove them. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the ARO is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. CMSEnergy and Consumers have not recorded liabilities for assets that have insignificant cumulative disposal costs, such as substation batteries.
In 2015, Consumers increased its ARO liability for coal ash disposal areas. The increase was attributable to proposed changes in state regulations based on the EPAs final ruleregarding CCRs, which provided Consumers with sufficient information to reasonably estimate an additional ARO liability associated with closure work at certain waste management facilities. For additional details, see Note4, Contingencies and CommitmentsConsumers Electric Utility ContingenciesElectric Environmental Matters.

DBPension Plan trust assets are not distinguishable by company.
DCCP and Cash Balance Pension Plan: CMSEnergy and Consumers provide an employer contribution of sixpercent of base pay to the DCCP401(k)plan for employees hired on or after September1,2005. Employees are not required to contribute in order to receive the plans employer contribution.
Participants in the Cash Balance Pension Plan, effective July1,2003 to August31,2005, also participate in the DCCP as of September1,2005. Additional pay credits under the Cash Balance Pension Plan were discontinued as of September 1,2005. DCCP expense for CMSEnergy and Consumers was $16million for the year ended December31,2015, $13million for the year ended December31,2014, and $10million for the year ended December31,2013.
DBSERP: The DBSERP is a non-qualified plan as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. DBSERP benefits are paid from a rabbi trust established in 1988. DBSERP rabbi trust earnings are taxable. Presented in the following table are the fair values of trust assets, ABO, and contributions for CMSEnergys and Consumers DBSERP: In   Millions Years Ended   December31 2015 2014 CMSEnergy, including Consumers Trust assets $148 $131 ABO 140 145 Contributions 25 - Consumers Trust assets $106 $93 ABO 97 99 Contributions 17 - DCSERP: On April1,2006, CMSEnergy and Consumers implemented a DCSERP and froze further new participation in the DBSERP. The DCSERP provides participants benefits ranging from 5percent to 15percent of total compensation. The DCSERP requires a minimum of fiveyears of participation before vesting. CMSEnergys and Consumers contributions to the plan, if any, are placed in a grantor trust. For CMSEnergy and Consumers, trust assets were $2million at December31,2015 and 2014. DCSERP assets are included in other non-current assets on CMSEnergys and Consumers consolidated 127 Table of Contents balance sheets. CMSEnergys and Consumers DCSERP expense was less than $1million for each of the years ended December31,2015, 2014, and 2013.
401(k)Plan: The 401(k)plan employer match equals 60percent of eligible contributions up to the first sixpercent of an employees wages. The total 401(k)plan cost for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, and for Consumers was $19million for the year ended December31,2015, $18million for the year ended December31,2014, and $1 7million for the year ended December31,2013.
OPEB Plan: Participants in the OPEB Plan include all regular full-time employees covered by the employee health care plan on the day before retirement from either CMSEnergy or Consumers at age 55 or older with at least ten full years of applicable continuous service. Regular full-time employees who qualify for DBPension Plan disability retirement and have 15years of applicable continuous service may also participate in the OPEB Plan. Retiree health care costs were based on the assumption that costs would increase 7.25percent in 2016 and 6.50percent in 2015 for those under 65 and would increase 8.00percent in 2016 and 6.50percent in 2015 for those over 65. The rate of increase was assumed to decline to 4.75percent by 2027 and thereafter for all retirees.
The assumptions used in the health care cost-trend rate affect service, interest, and PBO costs.

The mortality assumption for 2013 was based on the RP-2000 mortality tables with projection of future mortality improvements using ScaleAA, which aligned with the IRS prescriptions for cash funding valuations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The mortality assumption for net periodic benefit cost for 2015 was based on the RP-2014 mortality table with projection scale MP-2014, and for 2014 and 2013 was based on the RP-2000 mortality table.
2 The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from a yield-curve analysis. This analysis incorporated the projected benefit payments specific to CMSEnergys and Consumers DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan and the yields on high-quality corporate bonds rated Aa or better.
3 In January2016, CMSEnergy and Consumers changed the method in which they determine the discount rate used to calculate the service cost and interest expense components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans. Historically, the discount rate used for this purpose represented a single weighted-average rate derived from the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation. CMSEnergy and Consumers have elected to use instead a full-yield-curve approach in the estimation of service cost and interest expense; this approach is more accurate in that it applies individual spot rates along the yield curve to future projected benefit payments based on the time of payment. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect that this change will result in a decrease in the service cost and interest expense components of net periodic benefit costs for the DBPension and OPEB Plans, with an offsetting impact to the actuarial gain or loss recorded in, and later amortized from, the associated regulatory asset and AOCI. This change represents a change in accounting estimate and will not impact years prior to 2016.
4 CMSEnergy and Consumers determined the long-term rate of return using historical market returns, the present and expected future economic environment, the capital market principles of risk and return, and the expert opinions of individuals and firms with financial market knowledge. CMSEnergy and Consumers considered the asset allocation of the portfolio in forecasting the future expected total return of the portfolio. The goal was to determine a long-term rate of return that could be incorporated into the planning 129 Table of Contents of future cash flow requirements in conjunction with the change in the liability. Annually, CMSEnergy and Consumers review for reasonableness and appropriateness the forecasted returns for various classes of assets used to construct an expected return model. CMSEnergys and Consumers expected long-term rate of return on DBPension Plan assets was 7.5percent in 2015. The actual return (loss) on DBPension Plan assets was (2.0)percent in 2015, 7.4percent in 2014, and 12.5percent in 2013.

The estimated period of amortization of gains and losses for CMSEnergy and Consumers was tenyears for the DBPension Plan and 13years for OPEB for the years ended December31,2015, 2014, and 2013. Prior service cost (credit) amortization is established in the year in which the prior service cost (credit) first occurred, and is based on the same amortization period for all future years until the prior service cost (credit) is fully amortized. CMSEnergy and Consumers had a new prior service credit for OPEB in 2015 and 2013 and new prior service cost for the DBPension Plan in 2015. The estimated period of amortization of these new prior service costs (credits) for CMSEnergy and Consumers is tenyears.

U.S.Government and Agencies Securities: U.S.government and agencies securities consist of U.S.Treasury notes and other debt securities backed by the U.S.government and related agencies. These securities were valued based on quoted market prices.
Corporate Debt: Corporate debt investments consisted of investment grade bonds of U.S.issuers from diverse industries. These securities are valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or yields presently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
State and Municipal Bonds: State and municipal bonds were valued using a matrix-pricing model that incorporates Level2 market-based information. The fair value of the bonds was derived from various observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported securities trades, broker/dealer quotes, bond ratings, and general information on market movements for investment grade state and municipal securities normally considered by market participants when pricing such debt securities.
Foreign Corporate Bonds: Foreign corporate debt securities were valued based on quoted market prices, when available, or on yields available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
134 Table of Contents Common Stocks: Common stocks in the OPEB Plan consist of equity securities with low transaction costs that were actively managed and tracked by the S&P500 Index. These securities were valued at their quoted closing prices.
Mutual Funds: Mutual funds represent shares in registered investment companies that are priced based on the daily quoted NAVs that are publicly available and are the basis for transactions to buy or sell shares in the funds.
Pooled Funds: Pooled funds include both common and collective trust funds as well as special funds that contain only employee benefit plan assets from two or more unrelated benefit plans.

Target Asset Allocations: CMSEnergys target asset allocation for DBPension Plan assets is 50percent equity, 30percent fixed income, and 20percent alternative-strategy investments. This target asset allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&P MidCap and SmallCap Indexes and Foreign Equity Funds. Fixed-income investments are diversified across investment grade instruments of government and corporate issuers as well as high-yield and global bond funds. Alternative strategies are diversified across absolute return investment approaches and global tactical asset allocation. CMSEnergy and Consumers use annual liability measurements, quarterly portfolio reviews, and periodic asset/liability studies to evaluate the need for adjustments to the portfolio allocation.
CMSEnergy and Consumers established union and non-union VEBA trusts to fund their future retiree health and life insurance benefits. These trusts are funded through the ratemaking process for Consumers and through direct contributions from the non-utility subsidiaries. CMSEnergys and Consumers target asset allocation for the trusts is 50percent equity, 30percent fixed income, and 20percent alternative strategy investments. This target allocation is expected to continue to maximize the long-term return on plan assets, while maintaining a prudent level of risk. The level of acceptable risk is a function of the liabilities of the plan. Equity investments are diversified mostly across the S&P500 Index, with lesser allocations to the S&PSmallCap Index and Foreign Equity Funds.

Neither CMSEnergy nor Consumers plans to contribute to the OPEB or DB Pension Plans in 2016. Actual future contributions will depend on future investment performance, discount rates, and various factors related to the DBPension Plan and OPEB Plan participants.
Following amendments to the OPEB Plan in July2013, Consumers OPEB costs decreased substantially and, as a result, the OPEB Plan was fully funded at December31,2013. In May2014, Consumers filed an application with the MPSC requesting approval to suspend contributions to Consumers OPEB Plan during 2014 and 2015 if the OPEB Plan continued to be fully funded. Consumers electric and gas rates still reflect the higher OPEB costs, and previous MPSC orders required Consumers to contribute to the OPEB Plan the associated amount collected in rates annually.
In September2014, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement addressing Consumers OPEB Plan funding application. Under the settlement agreement, Consumers contributed $25million to the plan in 2014 and $29million in February2015. Consumers will suspend further contributions until the MPSC determines funding requirements in future general rate cases.

The UWUA represents Consumers operating, maintenance, construction, and call center employees. The USW represents Zeeland employees. Union contracts expire in 2020.
13: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CMSEnergy and Consumers provide a PISP to officers, employees, and non-employee directors based on their contributions to the successful management of the company. The PISP has a ten-year term, expiring in May2024.
In 2015, all awards were in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units. The PISP also allows for unrestricted common stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom shares, performance units, and incentive options, none of which was granted in 2015, 2014, or 2013.
Shares awarded or subject to stock options, phantom shares, or performance units may not exceed 6.5million shares from June2014 through May2024, nor may such awards to any recipient exceed 500,000shares in any calendar year. CMSEnergy and Consumers may issue awards of up to 5,611,442shares of common stock under the PISP as of December31,2015. Shares for which payment or exercise is in cash, as well as shares that expire, terminate, or are cancelled or forfeited, may be awarded or granted again under the PISP.
All awards under the PISP vest fully upon death. Upon a change of control of CMSEnergy or termination under an officer separation agreement, the awards will vest in accordance with specific officer agreements. If stated in the award, for restricted stock recipients who terminate employment due to retirement or disability, a pro-rata portion of the award will vest upon termination, with any market-based award also contingent upon the outcome of the market condition and any performance-based award contingent upon the outcome of the performance condition. The pro-rata portion is equal to the portion of the service period served between the award grant date and the employees termination date. The remaining portion of the awards will be forfeited. All awards for directors vest fully upon retirement. Restricted shares may be forfeited if employment terminates for any other reason or if the minimum service requirements are not met, as described in the award document.
137 Table of Contents Restricted Stock Awards: Restricted stock awards for employees under the PISP for 2015 and 2014 were in the form of performance-based, market-based, and time-lapse restricted stock. Prior to 2014, all grants were in the form of market-based and time-lapse restricted stock. Award recipients receive shares of CMSEnergy common stock that have dividend and voting rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, however, the dividends on performance-based and market-based restricted stock are paid in restricted shares equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted shares are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying restricted stock shares.
Performance-based restricted stock vesting is contingent on meeting at least a 36-month service requirement and a performance condition. The performance condition is based on CMSEnergys EPS growth relative to a peer group over a three-year period. The awards granted in 2015 and 2014 require a 38-month service period. Market-based restricted stock vesting is generally contingent on meeting a three-year service requirement and a market condition. The market condition is based on a comparison of CMSEnergys total shareholder return with the median total shareholder return of a peer group over the same three-year period. Depending on the outcome of the performance condition or the market condition, a recipient may earn a total award ranging from zero to 200percent of the initial grant. Time-lapse restricted stock generally vests after a service period of threeyears.
Restricted Stock Units: In 2015, CMSEnergy and Consumers granted restricted stock units to certain non-employee directors who elected to defer their restricted stock awards. The restricted stock units generally vest after a service period of one year or, if earlier, at the next annual meeting. The restricted stock units will be distributed to the recipients as shares in accordance with the directors deferral agreements. Restricted stock units do not have voting rights, but do have dividend rights. In lieu of cash dividend payments, the dividends on restricted stock units are paid in additional units equal to the value of the dividends. These additional restricted stock units are subject to the same vesting and distribution conditions as the underlying restricted stock units. No restricted stock units vested or were forfeited during 2015.

For performance-based awards, CMSEnergy and Consumers estimate the number of shares expected to vest at the end of the performance period based on the probable achievement of the performance objective. Performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards have graded vesting features for retirement-eligible employees, and CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize expense for those awards on a graded vesting schedule over the required service period. Expense for performance-based and market-based restricted stock awards for non-retirement-eligible employees and time-lapse awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period.
The fair value of performance-based and time-lapse restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the price of CMSEnergys common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based restricted stock awards is calculated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. CMSEnergy and Consumers base expected volatilities on the historical volatility of the price of CMSEnergy common stock. The risk-free rate for valuation of the market-based restricted stock awards was based on the three-year U.S.Treasury yield at the award grant date.
Presented in the following table are the most important assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the market-based restricted stock awards: Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 Expected   volatility 14.1 % 15.6 % 17.4 % Expected   dividend yield 3.3 3.7 3.9 Risk-free   rate 0.8 0.8 0.4 139 Table of Contents Presented in the following table is the weighted-average grant-date fair value of all awards under the PISP: Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Weighted-average   grant-date fair value per share Restricted stock   granted $ 36.84 $ 26.15 $ 16.65 Restricted stock   units granted 34.25 - - Consumers Weighted-average   grant-date fair value per share Restricted stock   granted $ 36.83 $ 26.18 $ 16.76 Restricted stock   units granted 34.25 - - Presented in the following table are amounts related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units: In   Millions Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 CMSEnergy, including Consumers Fair value of shares that vested during the year $ 29 $ 16 $ 10 Compensation expense recognized 20 14 14 Income tax benefit recognized 8 5 5 Consumers Fair value of shares that vested during the year $ 28 $ 15 $ 9 Compensation expense recognized 19 13 14 Income tax benefit recognized 7 5 5 At December31,2015, $15million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for CMSEnergy, including Consumers, and $15million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to restricted stock for Consumers. CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of 1.8years.
Since CMSEnergy has utilized tax loss carryforwards, CMSEnergy was unable to realize excess federal tax benefits upon vesting of restricted stock. Therefore, CMSEnergy did not recognize the related excess federal tax benefits in equity. Since CMSEnergy is not in a loss position for state tax purposes, CMSEnergy recognized the related state tax benefits of $1million in equity in 2015. As of December31,2015, CMSEnergy had $33million of unrealized excess federal tax benefits.
140 Table of Contents 14: INCOME TAXES CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and a unitary Michigan income tax return. Income taxes are allocated based on each companys separate taxable income in accordance with the CMSEnergy tax sharing agreement.
Presented in the following table is the difference between actual income tax expense on continuing operations and income tax expense computed by applying the statutory U.S.federal income tax rate: In   Millions, Except Tax Rate Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Income from   continuing operations before income taxes $ 796 $ 729 $ 756 Income tax   expense at statutory rate 279 255 265 Increase   (decrease) in income taxes from: State and local   income taxes, net of federal effect 39 36 37 Accelerated   flow-through of regulatory tax benefits (39 ) (39 ) - Other, net (8 ) (2 ) - Income tax   expense $ 271 $ 250 $ 302 Effective tax   rate 34.0 % 34.3 % 39.9 % Consumers Income from   continuing operations before income taxes $ 896 $ 873 $ 880 Income tax   expense at statutory rate 314 306 308 Increase   (decrease) in income taxes from: State and local   income taxes, net of federal effect 42 42 43 Accelerated   flow-through of regulatory tax benefits (39 ) (39 ) - Other, net (15 ) (3 ) (5 ) Income tax   expense $ 302 $ 306 $ 346 Effective tax   rate 33.7 % 35.1 % 39.3 % Prior to 2014, Consumers recognized the income tax benefits associated with the removal costs of plant placed in service before 1993 as payments were made and the tax benefits were flowed through to customers. In 2013, the MPSC issued an order authorizing Consumers to flow through to customers the income tax benefits on a straight-line basis over an accelerated period. This regulatory treatment, which Consumers implemented in January2014, will accelerate the return of $209million of income tax benefits over fiveyears to electric customers and $260million of income tax benefits over 12years to gas customers. This treatment reduced Consumers income tax expense by $39million for each of the years ended December31,2015 and 2014.

CMSEnergy and Consumers expect to utilize fully tax loss and credit carryforwards for which no valuation allowance has been provided. It is reasonably possible that further adjustments will be made to the valuation allowances within one year.
Presented in the following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax benefits: In   Millions Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 CMSEnergy,   including Consumers Balance at   beginning of period $ 5 $ 4 $ 1 Additions for   current-year tax positions 1 2 - Additions for   prior-year tax positions 1 1 3 Reductions for   prior-year tax positions (1 ) (2 ) - Balance at end   of period $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 Consumers Balance at   beginning of period $ 5 $ 4 $ 1 Additions for   current-year tax positions 1 2 - Additions for prior-year   tax positions 1 1 3 Reductions for   prior-year tax positions (1 ) (2 ) - Balance at end   of period $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 If recognized, all of these uncertain tax benefits would affect CMSEnergys and Consumers annual effective tax rates in future years.
CMSEnergy and Consumers recognize accrued interest and penalties, where applicable, as part of income tax expense. CMSEnergy, including Consumers, recognized no interest or penalties for the years ended December31,2015, 2014, or 2013.
In April2014, the IRS completed its audit of the federal income tax returns of CMSEnergy and its subsidiaries for 2010 and 2011. The audit resulted in no significant adjustments to CMSEnergys or Consumers taxable income or income tax expense.
CMSEnergys federal income tax returns for 2012 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. CMSEnergys MCIT and MBT returns for 2008 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the State of Michigan.
144 Table of Contents The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, which can result in proposed assessments. CMSEnergys and Consumers estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. CMSEnergy and Consumers believe that their accrued tax liabilities at December31,2015 were adequate for all years.
15: EARNINGS PER SHARECMSENERGY Presented in the following table are CMSEnergys basic and diluted EPS computations based on net income: In   Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Years   Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 Income   available to common stockholders Net income $ 525 $ 479 $ 454 Less income   attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 2 2 Net income   available to common stockholders  basic and diluted $ 523 $ 477 $ 452 Average   common shares outstanding Weighted-average   shares  basic 275.6 270.6 264.5 Add dilutive   contingently convertible securities - 3.1 6.4 Add dilutive   nonvested stock awards 0.9 0.9 1.0 Weighted-average   shares  diluted 276.5 274.6 271.9 Net   income per average common share available to common stockholders Basic $ 1.90 $ 1.76 $ 1.71 Diluted 1.89 1.74 1.66 Dividends   declared per common share $ 1.16 $ 1.08 $ 1.02 Contingently Convertible Securities In June2014, CMSEnergy redeemed its remaining contingently convertible securities. For the periods those securities were outstanding, they diluted EPS to the extent that the conversion value of the securities, which was based on the average market price of CMSEnergy common stock, exceeded their principal value.
Nonvested Stock Awards CMSEnergys nonvested stock awards are composed of participating and non-participating securities. The participating securities accrue cash dividends when common stockholders receive dividends. Since the recipient is not required to return the dividends to CMSEnergy if the recipient forfeits the award, the nonvested stock awards are considered participating securities. As such, the participating nonvested stock awards were included in the computation of basic EPS. The non-participating securities accrue stock dividends that vest concurrently with the stock award. If the recipient forfeits the award, the stock dividends accrued on the non-participating securities are also forfeited. Accordingly, the non-participating awards and stock dividends were included in the computation of diluted EPS, but not basic EPS.

CMSEnergy and Consumers evaluate the performance of each segment based on its contribution to net income available to CMSEnergys common stockholders.
Accounting policies for CMSEnergys and Consumers segments are as described in Note1, Significant Accounting Policies. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of the individual segments when appropriate. Accounts are allocated among the segments when common accounts are attributable to more than one segment. The allocations are based on certain measures of business activities, such as revenue, labor dollars, customers, other operation and maintenance expense, construction expense, leased property, taxes, or functional surveys. For example, customer receivables are allocated based on revenue, and pension provisions are allocated based on labor dollars.
Inter-segment sales and transfers are accounted for at current market prices and are eliminated in consolidated net income available to common stockholders by segment.
CMSEnergy The reportable segments for CMSEnergy are:  electric utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in Michigan  gas utility, consisting of regulated activities associated with the transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas in Michigan  enterprises, consisting of various subsidiaries engaging primarily in domestic independent power production CMSEnergy presents EnerBank and corporate interest and other expenses within other reconciling items.

18: RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONSCONSUMERS Consumers enters into a number of transactions with related parties. These transactions include:  purchases of electricity from affiliates of CMSEnterprises  payments to and from CMSEnergy related to parent company overhead costs  investment in CMSEnergy common stock Transactions involving power supply purchases from certain affiliates of CMSEnterprises are based on avoided costs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, state law, and competitive bidding. The payment of parent company overhead costs is based on the use of accepted industry allocation methodologies. These payments are for costs that occur in the normal course of business.
150 Table of Contents Presented in the following table is Consumers expense recorded from related party transactions for the years ended December31: In Millions Description Related Party 2015 2014 2013 Purchases of capacity and energy Affiliates of CMSEnterprises $83 $89 $89 Amounts payable to related parties for purchased power and other services were $23 million at December 31, 2015 and $12 million at December31,2014.
Accounts receivable from related parties were $17million at December31,2015, primarily representing Consumers payment of postretirement benefits contributions on behalf of CMSEnergy. Accounts receivable from related parties were $1million at December31,2014.
Consumers owned shares of CMSEnergy common stock with a fair value of $29million at December31,2015. For additional details on Consumers investment in CMSEnergy common stock, see Note7, Financial Instruments.
In January2016, Consumers renewed a short-term credit agreement with CMSEnergy, permitting Consumers to borrow up to $300million. At December31,2015, there were no outstanding loans under the agreement.
19: VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CMSEnergy has variable interests in T.E.S.Filer City, Grayling, and Genesee. CMSEnergy is not the primary beneficiary of any of these partnerships because power is shared among unrelated parties, and no one party has the power to direct activities, such as operations and maintenance, plant dispatch, and fuel strategy, that most significantly impact the entities economic performance. The partners must agree on all major decisions for each of the partnerships.
Presented in the following table is information about these partnerships: Name (Ownership   Interest) Nature of the   Entity Financing of   Partnership T.E.S. Filer City (50%) Coal-fueled   power generator Non-recourse   long-term debt that matured in December2007.
Grayling (50%) Wood   waste-fueled power generator Sale of revenue   bonds that were retired in March2012.
Genesee (50%) Wood   waste-fueled power generator Sale of revenue   bonds that mature in 2021 and bear interest at fixed rates. The debt is   non-recourse to the partners and secured by a CMSEnergy guarantee   capped at $3million annually.
CMSEnergy has operating and management contracts with Grayling and Genesee, and Consumers is the primary purchaser of power from each partnership through long-term PPAs. Consumers also has reduced dispatch agreements with Grayling and Genesee, which allow these facilities to be dispatched based on the market price of wood waste. This results in fuel cost savings that each partnership shares with Consumers customers.
CMSEnergys investment in these partnerships is included in investments on its consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $59million as of December31,2015 and $57million as of December31,2014. The creditors of these partnerships do not have recourse to the general credit of CMSEnergy or Consumers, except through a guarantee provided by CMSEnergy of $3million annually. CMSEnergy 151 Table of Contents has deferred collections on certain receivables owed by Genesee. CMSEnergys maximum exposure to loss from these receivables is $8million. Consumers has not provided any financial or other support during the periods presented that was not previously contractually required.

152 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CMSEnergy Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows, and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CMSEnergy Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31,2015 and December31,2014 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the threeyears in the period ended December31,2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item15(a)(2)present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP Detroit, Michigan February11,2016 153 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of Consumers Energy Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows, and of changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consumers Energy Company and its subsidiaries at December31,2015 and December31,2014 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the threeyears in the period ended December31,2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item15(a)(2)presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Item9A. Controls and Procedures CMSENERGY Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMSEnergy conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(e)and 15d-15(e)under the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, CMSEnergys CEO and CFO have concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31,2015.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: CMSEnergys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15(f)and 15d-15(f). CMSEnergys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of CMSEnergy  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CMSEnergy are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of CMSEnergy  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of CMSEnergys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements Management, including its CEO and CFO, does not expect that its internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its CEO and CFO, CMSEnergy conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015.
