PART I Item 1 . Business.
General Becton, Dickinson and Company (also known as BD) was incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in November 1906, as successor to a New York business started in 1897. BDs executive offices are located at 1 Becton Drive, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey 07417-1880, and its telephone number is (201) 847-6800. All references in this Form 10-K to BD refer to Becton, Dickinson and Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated by the context.
BD is a medical technology company engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public.
Business Segments BDs operations consist of three worldwide business segments: BD Medical, BD Diagnostics and BD Biosciences. Information with respect to BDs business segments is included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the portions of BDs Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 attached hereto as Exhibit 13, and is incorporated herein by reference.
BD Medical BD Medical produces a broad array of medical devices that are used in a wide range of healthcare settings. They include many safety-engineered injection, infusion and surgery products. BD  Medicals principal product lines include needles, syringes and intravenous catheters for medication delivery; prefilled IV flush syringes; and syringes and pen needles for the self-injection of insulin and other drugs used in the treatment of  diabetes; prefillable drug delivery devices provided to pharmaceutical companies and sold to end-users as drug/device combinations; surgical blades/scalpels and regional anesthesia needles and trays; critical care monitoring devices; ophthalmic surgical  instruments; sharps disposal containers; and home healthcare products such as ACE brand elastic bandages. The primary markets served by BD Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians office practices; consumers and retail pharmacies;  public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers.
BD Diagnostics BD Diagnostics provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostic specimens and instrumentation for analysis across a broad range of infectious disease testing, including healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). BD Diagnostics principal products and services include integrated systems for specimen collection; an extensive line of safety-engineered blood collection products and systems; plated media; automated blood culturing systems; molecular testing systems for sexually transmitted diseases and HAIs; microorganism identification and drug susceptibility systems; liquid-based cytology systems for cervical cancer screenings; and rapid diagnostic assays. BD Diagnostics serves hospitals, laboratories and clinics; reference laboratories; blood banks; healthcare workers; patients; physicians office practices; and industrial microbiology laboratories.
BD Biosciences BD Biosciences produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of cells, and the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes. That  information is used to aid the discovery and development of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases. BD Biosciences principal product lines include fluorescence-activated cell sorters and analyzers; cell imaging systems, monoclonal antibodies and kits for performing cell analysis; reagent systems for life sciences research; tools to aid in drug discovery and growth of tissue and cells; cell culture media supplements for biopharmaceutical manufacturing; and diagnostic assays. The primary markets served by BD Biosciences are research and clinical laboratories; hospitals and transplant centers; blood banks; and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
Acquisitions On December 20, 2006, BD acquired the outstanding shares (approximately 93.8%) of TriPath Imaging, Inc. (TriPath) that it did not previously own.  TriPath develops, manufactures, markets and sells innovative solutions to improve the clinical management of cancer, including detection, diagnosis, staging and treatment. The acquisition advances BDs position in cancer diagnostics.
On May 4, 2007, BD acquired all of the outstanding shares of Plasso Technology, Ltd. (Plasso), a privately-held company that is developing the next generation of surface-critical research tools utilizing functional coating technology for applications in glycomics and cell culture.
See further discussion of these acquisitions in Note 3 to the   consolidated financial statements contained in Exhibit 13, which is incorporated   herein by reference.
International Operations BDs products are manufactured and sold worldwide. BDs operations outside the United States are conducted in Canada and in five geographic regions: Europe (which includes the Middle East and Africa); Japan; Asia Pacific (which includes Australia and all of Asia except Japan); South Latin America (which includes Brazil); and North Latin America (which includes Mexico). The principal products sold by BD outside of the United States are hypodermic needles and syringes; insulin syringes and pen needles; diagnostic systems; BD Vacutainer brand blood collection products; BD Hypak brand prefillable syringe systems; infusion therapy products; flow cytometry instruments and reagents; and disposable laboratory products. BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Pakistan, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Geographic information with respect to BDs operations is included under the heading Geographic Information in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Exhibit 13, and is incorporated herein by reference.
Foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues. BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein, as well as local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties. See further discussion of this risk in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Distribution BDs products and services are marketed in the U.S. and internationally through independent sales representatives and independent distribution channels, and directly to end-users. Sales to a single U.S. distributor that supplies products from the BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments to many end-users accounted for approximately 9% of total BD revenues in fiscal 2007. However, the end-users of BDs products have access to them through other distributors, and, as a result, BD believes that sales to this distributor would be replaced largely, if not entirely, by other sales if BD no longer sold products to this distributor. Order backlog is not material to BDs business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally are received and filled on a current basis, except for items temporarily out of stock. BDs worldwide sales are not generally seasonal, with the exception of certain medical devices in the BD Medical segment and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the BD Diagnostics segment that relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza.
Raw Materials BD purchases many different types of raw materials, including plastics, glass, metals, textiles, paper products, agricultural products, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various biological, chemical and petrochemical products.  Certain raw materials (primarily related to the BD Biosciences segment) are not available from multiple sources. In the case of certain principal raw materials that are available from multiple sources, for various reasons (including quality assurance and cost effectiveness), BD elects to purchase these raw materials from sole suppliers. In other cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to qualification of suppliers, BD may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis. While BD works closely with its suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, the termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these sole-sourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.
Research and Development BD conducts its research and development activities at its operating units and at BD Technologies in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Substantially all of BDs research and development activities are conducted  in the U.S. BD also collaborates with certain universities, medical centers and other entities on research and development programs. BD also retains individual consultants to support its efforts in specialized fields. BD spent approximately $360 million, $302 million and $268 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, BD incurred acquired in-process research and development charges of $122 million related to the acquisitions of TriPath and Plasso in fiscal year 2007, and $53 million related to the acquisition of GeneOhm in fiscal year 2006.
2 Intellectual Property and Licenses BD owns significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. BD is also licensed under domestic  and foreign patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to BDs business. BD believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BDs business as a whole, or any business segment.
Competition BD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace whose dynamics are changing. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, and regulation of increasingly more sophisticated and complex medical products is increasing. Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field. Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly in the areas of safety-engineered devices and in life sciences, and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area. Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well. Acquisitions and collaborations by and among other companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment.
BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, innovation, service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors on BDs competitive position varies among BDs various product offerings. In order to implement one of its core strategiesto increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchersand maintain an advantage in the competitive environment in which it operates, BD continues to make investments in research and development, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation and productivity improvement.
Third-Party Reimbursement Healthcare providers and/or facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through numerous payment systems designed by governmental agencies (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., the National Health Service in the U.K., the Joint Federal Committee in Germany, the Commission dEvaluation des Produits et prestations in France, and the Ministry for Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan), private insurance companies, and managed care programs. The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case typically depends on the procedure(s) performed, the final patient diagnosis, the device(s) and/or drug(s) utilized, or a combination of these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at the payers discretion. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products. Thus, changes in reimbursement level or method may either positively or negatively impact sales of BD products. While BD is actively engaged in promoting the value of its products for payers and patients and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage, coding and payment processes in this regard, it has no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and adequate payment level for BD products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services within the Medicare program, so-called pay-for-performance programs implemented by various public and private payers, etc.) that could potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for current or future BD products.
As BDs product offerings are diverse across many healthcare settings, they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment systems. Therefore, while individual countries, product lines or product classes may be impacted, BD does not believe that significant changes to any one of these systems would have a material adverse effect on BD.
Regulation BDs medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of BDs medical products. The scope of the activities of these agencies, particularly in the Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates, has been increasing.
Prior to marketing or selling most of its products, BD must secure approval from the FDA and counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Following the introduction of a product, these agencies engage in periodic reviews of BDs manufacturing processes and product performance. These regulatory controls can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and 3 continued availability of new products. Where possible, BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes.
These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions. BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls.
In November 2006, we received a warning letter from the FDA with respect to our facility in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, at which we manufacture certain blood collection products. The warning  letter makes certain observations regarding our compliance with the Current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements of the FDAs Quality System regulation. In response to the warning letter, BD developed and implemented a comprehensive  corrective and preventive action plan that was completed in fiscal year 2007. The FDA recently re-inspected the San Lorenzo facility and found all warning letter commitments met and satisfactory. We are awaiting a close-out letter.
BD believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the regulations promulgated by such agencies, and that such compliance has not had, and, BD believes, should not have, a material adverse effect on BD. BD also believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Such compliance has not had, and, BD believes, should not have, a material adverse effect on BD. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Employees As of September 30, 2007, BD had 28,018 employees, of whom 12,803 were employed in the United States (including Puerto Rico). BD believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.
Other Matters Becton Dickinson France, S.A. (BD-France), a subsidiary of BD, was listed among approximately 2,200 other companies in an October 27, 2005 report of the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) of the United Nations (UN) as having been involved in humanitarian contracts in which unauthorized payments were suspected of having been made to the Iraqi Government in connection with the UNs Oil-for-Food Programme (the Programme). In connection with the IICs report, Becton Dickinson AG, a Swiss subsidiary of BD, received a letter of inquiry from the Vendor Review Committee (VRC) of the United Nations Procurement Service dated November 22, 2005. The letter of inquiry said that the VRC is reviewing Becton Dickinson AGs registration status in light of BD-France being listed in the IICs report and asked us for any information we might provide relating to the findings of the report. BD conducted an internal review and found no evidence that BD or any BD employee made, authorized, or approved improper payments to the Iraqi Government in connection with the Programme. The representative utilized by BD in Iraq also unequivocally denied having made any such payments, and BD was unable to find any evidence of such payments being made by this representative. BD has also reported the results of its internal review to the VRC. In May 2007, the French Judicial Police conducted searches of BD-Frances offices in France with respect to the matters that were the subject of the 2005 IIC report. We were informed that it is one of a number of companies named in the IIC report that is being investigated by the French Judicial Police. We are cooperating fully with the investigation.

4 Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect BDs business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
BDs future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed.
A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers. The development of these products requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including BDs ability to innovate, develop and manufacture new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, or gain and maintain market approval of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance.
The medical device industry is very competitive.
The medical device industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold. We face this competition from a wide range of companies. These include large medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from firms that are more specialized than us with respect to particular markets. Non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. See Competition under Item 1. Business. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive.  In addition, some competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in China and other low-cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs. New entrants may also appear, particularly from these low-cost countries.
Inflation and fluctuations in the       cost of raw materials could adversely affect the results of our operations.
It is     possible that general inflation rates will rise in 2008 and beyond, and could     have a greater impact on worldwide economies and, consequently, on BD. BD     purchases supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the     manufacture of certain products. Any significant increases in resin purchase     costs could impact future operating results.
A reduction or interruption in the       supply of certain raw materials would adversely affect BDs manufacturing       operations and related product sales.
BD purchases many different types of raw materials. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of these materials. However, certain raw materials (primarily related to the BD Biosciences segment) are not available from multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, BD elects to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. In addition, where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement 5 sources on a timely basis. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these sole-sourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.
Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operating income.
We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In addition, in some instances, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. As a result, natural disasters (including pandemic disease), political change, or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.
BD is subject to a number of pending lawsuits .
BD is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and product liability, and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. A more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. Any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BDs results of operations and cash flows.
Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operating income.
The medical device industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased. In addition, group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated health delivery networks (IDNs) have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.
Changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.
Our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs of our products. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the U.S. or abroad in a manner could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using BD medical devices, or result in denial of reimbursement for those products. See Third-Party Reimbursement under Item 1. Business.
Product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations.
The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals.
BD is subject to extensive regulation.
BD is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Most of BDs products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold. The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products.
Following the introduction of a product, these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay the production or marketing of our products and result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, or seizures or recalls of products.
6 We cannot guarantee that any of BDs strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.
While our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven primarily by internal product development, we will seek to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate it into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.
We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.
Over half of our fiscal year 2007 revenues were derived from international operations. Our revenues outside the U.S. are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading Financial Instrument Market Risk under Financial Review contained in Exhibit 13, which is incorporated herein by reference. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The international operations of BDs business may subject BD to certain business risks.
BD operations outside the U.S. subject BD to certain risks, including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (as discussed above), changes in foreign regulatory requirements, potential political instability, trade barriers, weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders. The success of our operations outside the U.S. will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire or form alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and distribution networks.
Reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our BD Biosciences segment.
Our BD Biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A number of these customers are also dependent upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and agencies in other countries for their funding. The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable. In addition, there have been instances where NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products.
Our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property rights.
Many of BDs businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights. While we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would materially affect BD operations, these intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. BD can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows.
Natural disasters, war or terrorism could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operating income.
Natural disasters, war, terrorism and international conflicts, and actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and in areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or our ability to source materials from our suppliers.

Legal Proceedings.
BD is named as a defendant in five purported class action suits brought on behalf of direct purchasers of BDs products, such as distributors, alleging that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for BDs products to the plaintiff and other purported class members. The cases filed are as follows: Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc., et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company (Civil Action No. 05-1602, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on March 25, 2005; SAJ Distributors, Inc. et. al. vs. Becton Dickinson & Co. (Case 2:05-CV-04763-JD, United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), filed on September 6, 2005; Dik Drug Company, et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson and Company (Case No. 2:05-CV-04465, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on September 12, 2005; American Sales Company, Inc. et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson & Co. (Case No. 2:05-CV-05212-CRM, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), filed on October 3, 2005; and Park Surgical Co. Inc. et. al. vs. Becton, Dickinson and Company (Case 2:05-CV-05678-CMR, United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania), filed on October 26, 2005.
The actions brought by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company and Dik Drug Company in New Jersey have been consolidated under the caption In re Hypodermic Products Antitrust Litigation.
BD is also named as a defendant in four purported class action suits brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of BDs products, alleging that BD violated federal antitrust laws, resulting in the charging of higher prices for BDs products to the plaintiff and other purported class members. The cases filed are as follows: Jabos Pharmacy, Inc., et. al. v. Becton Dickinson & Company (Case No. 2:05-CV-00162, United States District Court, Greenville, Tennessee) filed on June 7, 2005; Drug Mart Tallman, Inc., et. al. v. Becton Dickinson and Company (Case No. 2:06-CV-00174, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on January 17, 2006; Medstar v. Becton Dickinson (Case No. 06-CV-03258-JLL (RJH), U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on May 18, 2006; and The Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale v. Becton Dickinson and Company (Case No. 07-CV-2544, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York), filed on March 28, 2007. A fifth purported class action on behalf of indirect purchasers (International Multiple Sclerosis Management Practice v. Becton Dickinson & Company (Case No. 2:07-cv-10602, U.S. District Court, Newark, New Jersey), filed on April 5, 2007) was voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff.
The plaintiffs in each of the antitrust class action lawsuits seek monetary damages. All of the antitrust class action lawsuits have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in federal court in New Jersey.
On August 31, 2005, Daniels Sharpsmart filed suit against BD, another manufacturer and three group purchasing organizations under the caption Daniels Sharpsmart, Inc. v. Tyco International, (US) Inc., et. al. (Civil Action No. 505CV169, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that BD and the other defendants conspired to exclude the plaintiff from the sharps-collection market by entering into long-term contracts in violation of federal and state antitrust laws, and sought monetary damages. On September 28, 2007, BD and the plaintiff entered into an agreement to settle the matter on terms that are not material to BD.
On June 6, 2006, UltiMed, Inc., a Minnesota company, filed suit against BD in the United States District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota (UltiMed, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson and Company (06CV2266)).  The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that BD excluded the plaintiff from the market for home use insulin syringes by entering into anticompetitive contracts in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks money damages and injunctive relief.
In June 2007, Retractable Technologies, Inc. (plaintiff) filed a complaint against BD under the caption Retractable Technologies, Inc. vs. Becton Dickinson and Company (Civil Action No. 2:07-cv-250, United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas). Plaintiff alleges that the BD Integra syringes infringe patents licensed exclusively to the plaintiff. This patent claim was not covered by the release contained in the July 2004 settlement agreement between BD and plaintiff to settle the lawsuit previously filed by plaintiff.  In its complaint, plaintiff also alleges that BD engaged in false advertising with respect to certain of BDs safety-engineered products in violation of the Lanham Act; acted to exclude the plaintiff from various product markets and to maintain its market share through, among other things, exclusionary contracts in violation of state and Federal antitrust laws; and engaged in unfair competition. The non-patent claims purport to relate to actions allegedly taken by BD following the date of the July 2004 settlement agreement referenced above. Plaintiff seeks treble damages, attorneys fees and injunctive relief.
BD, along with another manufacturer and several medical product distributors, is named as a defendant in three product liability lawsuits relating to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained accidental needlesticks, but  have not become infected with any disease. Generally, these actions allege that healthcare workers have sustained needlesticks using hollow-bore needle devices manufactured by BD and, as a result, require medical testing, counseling and/or  treatment. In some cases, these actions additionally allege that the healthcare workers have sustained mental anguish. Plaintiffs seek money damages in all of these actions. BD had previously been named as a defendant in eight similar suits relating  to healthcare workers who allegedly sustained accidental needlesticks, each of which has either been dismissed with prejudice or voluntarily withdrawn. Regarding the three pending suits: 9 In Ohio, Grant vs. Becton Dickinson et al. (Case No. 98CVB075616, Franklin County Court), on September 21, 2006, the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the trial courts grant of class certification. The matter has been remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the class can be redefined.
In Oklahoma and South Carolina, cases have been filed on behalf of an unspecified number of healthcare workers seeking class action certification under the laws of these states in state court in Oklahoma, under the caption Palmer vs. Becton Dickinson et. al. (Case No. CJ-98-685, Sequoyah County District Court), filed on October 27, 1998, and in state court in South Carolina, under the caption Bales vs. Becton Dickinson et. al. (Case No. 98-CP-40-4343, Richland County Court of Common Pleas), filed on November 25, 1998.
BD continues to oppose class action certification in these cases, including pursuing all appropriate rights of appeal.
BD, along with a number of other manufacturers, was named as a defendant in approximately 524 product liability lawsuits in various state and Federal courts related to natural rubber latex gloves which BD ceased manufacturing in 1995. Cases pending in Federal court are being coordinated under the matter In re Latex Gloves Products Liability Litigation (MDL Docket No. 1148) in Philadelphia, and analogous procedures have been implemented in the state courts of California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.  Generally, these actions allege that medical personnel have suffered allergic reactions ranging from skin irritation to anaphylaxis as a result of exposure to medical gloves containing natural rubber latex. Since the inception of this litigation, 467 of these cases have been closed with no liability to BD, and 46 cases have been settled for an aggregate de minimis amount.
On August 8, 2005, BD received a subpoena issued by the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, which seeks documents and information relating to BDs participation as a member of Healthcare Research & Development Institute, LLC (HRDI), a healthcare trade organization. The subpoena indicated that it was issued as part of an investigation into possible violations of the antitrust laws. On August 21, 2006, BD received a subpoena issued by the Attorney General of the State of Illinois which sought documents and information relating to BDs participation as a member of HRDI. The subpoena indicated that it was issued as part of an investigation into possible violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, Charitable Trust Act, and Solicitation for Charity Act. An independent member of BDs board of directors, Gary Mecklenburg, also served as a member and the non-executive chairman of HRDI until November 5, 2006. In January 2007, it was reported that HRDI entered into a settlement with the Attorneys General of Connecticut and Florida with respect to the investigation being conducted by the Connecticut Attorney General (BD has not been contacted by the State of Florida). To BDs knowledge, both the Connecticut and Illinois investigations are still ongoing. BD believes that its participation in HRDI complied fully with the law and has responded to these subpoenas. BD has not received any communication with respect to either investigation since completing its document production.
On May 28, 2004, Therasense, Inc. (Therasense) filed suit against BD in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Case Number: C 04-02123 WDB) asserting that BDs blood glucose monitoring products infringe certain Therasense patents. On August 10, 2004, in response to a motion filed by Therasense in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the court transferred to the court in California an action previously filed by BD against Therasense requesting a declaratory judgment that BDs products do not infringe the Therasense patents and that the Therasense patents are invalid.
In July 2007, BD received notice of a suit instituted in Saudi Arabia by El Seif Development (El Seif), a former distributor of BD (Case No. 7516, Board of Grievances, Saudi Arabia).  El Seif seeks monetary damages arising out of the termination of its distributor agreement and other contractual arrangements with BD.
BD has been served with a qui tam complaint filed by a private party against BD in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, alleging violations of the Federal False Claims Act (FCA) and the Texas False Claims Act (the TFCA). Under the FCA, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division has a certain period of time in which to decide whether to join the claim against BD as an additional plaintiff; if not, the private plaintiff is free to pursue the claim on its own. A similar process is followed under the TFCA. To BD's knowledge, no decision has yet been made by the Civil Division or the State of Texas whether to join this claim.
BD believes that it has meritorious defenses to each of the above-mentioned suits pending against BD and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters.
BD is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
BD is a party to a number of Federal proceedings in the United States brought under the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund, and similar state laws. The affected sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances, the remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental studies are commencing. For all sites, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all cleanup costs.
10 Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, BD is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which BD is a party. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, BD establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). In view of the uncertainties discussed above, BD could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BDs consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows.
