(including its subsidiaries, Amgen or the Company) is a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. In July 2002, Amgen completed its acquisition of Immunex Corporation (Immunex). Immunex was a leading biotechnology company dedicated to developing immune system science to protect human health.
The Company markets human therapeutic products including, EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), and Kineret  (anakinra). Amgen acquired the rights to ENBREL  (etanercept) as a result of the Immunex acquisition. ENBREL  is marketed with Wyeth under a co-promotion agreement. EPOGEN  stimulates the production of red blood cells and is marketed in the United States for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure in patients on dialysis. Aranesp  stimulates the production of red blood cells and is marketed in the United States, most countries in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. Aranesp  is also marketed in the United States for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. Aranesp  is approved in Europe for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy, and has been launched in several countries in Europe for this indication. NEUPOGEN  selectively stimulates the production of neutrophils, one type of white blood cell. The Company markets NEUPOGEN  in the United States, certain countries in Europe, Canada, and Australia for use in decreasing the incidence of infection in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. In addition, NEUPOGEN  is marketed in most of these countries for use in increasing neutrophil counts in various other treatment modalities. The Company began marketing Neulasta  in the United States in April 2002 to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. In August 2002, the European Commission approved Neulasta  for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. In January 2003, the Company commenced launching Neulasta  in Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement has been established. ENBREL  blocks the biologic activity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by competitively inhibiting TNF, a substance induced in response to inflammatory and immunological responses. ENBREL  is marketed in the United States and Canada for the reduction of the signs and symptoms in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Kineret  blocks the biologic activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a substance that mediates inflammatory and immunological responses. Kineret  is marketed in the United States for the reduction of the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, in patients 18years of age or older who have failed one or more disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. Kineret  is also approved for use in Europe and Canada. In addition, Amgen has entered into licensing and/or co-promotion agreements to market certain of its products including Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , and Neulasta  in certain geographic areas outside of the United States.
The Company focuses its research and development efforts on human therapeutics delivered in the form of proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecules in the areas of nephrology, oncology, inflammation, neurology, and metabolic disorders. The Company has research facilities in the United States, and has clinical development staff in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan. In addition to internal research and development efforts, the Company has acquired certain product and technology rights and has established research and development collaborations.
The Company manufactures EPOGEN  , Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  , ENBREL  , and Kineret  . Amgen operates commercial manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Puerto Rico, and a packaging and distribution center in The Netherlands. Additional supply of ENBREL  is produced by contract 3 Table of Contents manufacturers. A sales and marketing force is maintained in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
The Company was incorporated in California in 1980 and was merged into a Delaware corporation in 1987. Amgens principal executive offices are located at One Amgen Center Drive, Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799.
Products EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa) EPOGEN  (proper nameEpoetin alfa) is Amgens registered trademark for its recombinant human erythropoietin product, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. Red blood cells transport oxygen to all cells of the body. Without adequate amounts of erythropoietin, the red blood cell count is reduced, thereby diminishing the ability of the blood to deliver sufficient amounts of oxygen to the body, resulting in anemia. People with chronic renal failure suffer from anemia because they do not produce sufficient amounts of erythropoietin, which is normally produced in healthy kidneys. Amgen markets EPOGEN  for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure for patients who are on dialysis. EPOGEN  is indicated to elevate or maintain the red blood cell level (as determined by hematocrit or hemoglobin measurements) and to decrease the need for blood transfusions in these patients.
In the United States, Amgen was granted rights to market recombinant human erythropoietin under a licensing agreement with Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (Kirin-Amgen), a joint venture between Kirin Brewery Company, Limited (Kirin) and Amgen (see Joint Ventures and Business RelationshipsKirin Brewery Company, Limited). The Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and launched EPOGEN  in 1989 for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. In November 1999, the FDA approved EPOGEN  for the treatment of anemia in children with chronic renal failure who are on dialysis.
The Company has retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. Amgen has granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to Ortho Biotech Products, L.P., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, hereafter referred to as Johnson & Johnson) a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the UnitedStates in all markets other than dialysis (see Joint Ventures and Business RelationshipsJohnson & Johnson). Johnson & Johnson markets recombinant human erythropoietin under the trademark PROCRIT  in the UnitedStates (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of significant accounting policiesProduct sales).
EPOGEN  sales for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $2,260.6 million, $2,108.5million, and $1,962.9 million, respectively.
Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) Aranesp  (proper namedarbepoetin alfa) is Amgens registered trademark for its erythropoiesis stimulating protein, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. A reduced red blood cell count can result in anemia (see EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa)). Since this protein leaves the body more slowly, Aranesp  should be administered less frequently than Epoetin alfa, thus simplifying anemia management for patients and health care providers.
The Company has an agreement with Kirin to jointly develop darbepoetin alfa through its joint venture, Kirin-Amgen (see Joint Ventures and Business RelationshipsKirin Brewery Company, Limited). Amgen was granted an exclusive license by Kirin-Amgen to manufacture and market darbepoetin alfa in the UnitedStates, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and all Central and SouthAmerican countries. In 2001, the Company received approval to market Aranesp  in the United States, 4 Table of Contents most countries in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. In July 2002, the Company received approval to market Aranesp  in the United States for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. In August 2002, Aranesp  was approved in Canada for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. In August 2002, the European Commission approved Aranesp  for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. Aranesp  has been launched in several countries in Europe for this indication. Amgen markets darbepoetin alfa under the brand name Nespo  in Italy.
Worldwide Aranesp  sales for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $415.6 million and $41.5million, respectively.
NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) NEUPOGEN  (proper nameFilgrastim) is Amgens registered trademark for its recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a protein that selectively stimulates production of certain white blood cells known as neutrophils. Neutrophils defend against infection. Treatments for various diseases and diseases themselves can result in extremely low numbers of neutrophils, a condition called neutropenia. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy, one treatment option for individuals with certain types of cancers, targets cell types which grow rapidly, such as tumor cells, neutrophils, and other types of blood cells. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy can be administered with the intent to cure cancer (curative setting) or with the intent to reduce pain and other complications of cancer by managing tumor growth (palliative setting). NEUPOGEN  is prescribed more frequently in the curative setting. Providing NEUPOGEN  as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy can reduce the duration of neutropenia and thereby reduce the potential for infection.
Severe chronic neutropenia is an example of disease-related neutropenia. In severe chronic neutropenia, the body fails to manufacture sufficient neutrophils. Daily administration of NEUPOGEN  has been shown to reduce the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences, such as fever and infections, in symptomatic patients with severe chronic neutropenia.
Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation may be treated with NEUPOGEN  to accelerate recovery of neutrophils following chemotherapy and bone marrow infusion. NEUPOGEN  also has been shown to induce immature blood cells (progenitor cells, sometimes referred to as stem cells) to migrate (mobilize) from the bone marrow into the blood circulatory system. When these peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) are collected from the blood, stored, and re-infused (transplanted) after high dose chemotherapy, recovery of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils is accelerated. PBPC transplantation may be an alternative to autologous bone marrow transplantation for some cancer patients.
In the United States, NEUPOGEN  was initially indicated to decrease the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Subsequently, the FDA approved NEUPOGEN  for additional indications: to reduce the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related consequences for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; to reduce the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, or idiopathic neutropenia (collectively, severe chronic neutropenia); for use in mobilization of PBPC for stem cell transplantation; and to reduce the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment in adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In Europe, Canada, and Australia, NEUPOGEN  is marketed for these same indications. The Company also markets NEUPOGEN  in Europe, Canada, and Australia for the treatment of neutropenia in HIV patients receiving antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive medications.
5 Table of Contents Amgen was granted rights to market G-CSF under a licensing agreement with Kirin-Amgen in the UnitedStates, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company began selling NEUPOGEN  in the United States in 1991. In May 2002, the Company acquired certain rights related to the commercialization of NEUPOGEN  and GRANULOKINE  (Filgrastim) and pegfilgrastim in the European Union (EU) from F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche). Prior to this acquisition, NEUPOGEN  and GRANULOKINE  were commercialized in the EU under a co-promotion agreement between Amgen and Roche. Roche will continue as the licensee for Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in certain countries outside the United States and the EU (see Joint Ventures and Business RelationshipsF. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd). Amgen markets Filgrastim under the brand name GRANULOKINE  in Italy.
Worldwide NEUPOGEN  sales for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $1,379.6million, $1,346.4 million, and $1,223.7 million, respectively.
Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim) Neulasta  (proper namepegfilgrastim) is Amgens trademark for a protein that selectively stimulates production of certain white blood cells known as neutrophils and is based on the Filgrastim molecule. A polyethylene glycol molecule or PEG unit is added to enlarge the Filgrastim molecule, thereby extending its half-life and causing it to be removed more slowly from the body. This allows for administration as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle compared with NEUPOGEN  which requires more frequent dosing.
Amgen was granted rights to market pegfilgrastim under a licensing agreement with Kirin-Amgen. In January 2002, the FDA approved Neulasta  for decreasing the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. The Company launched Neulasta  in the UnitedStates in April 2002 for this indication. In August 2002, the European Commission approved Neulasta  for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. In January 2003, the Company commenced launching Neulasta  in Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement has been established. Amgen markets pegfilgrastim under the brand name Neupopeg  in Italy.
Neulasta  sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $463.5 million.
ENBREL  (etanercept) ENBREL  (proper nameetanercept) is Amgens registered trademark for its TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits the binding of TNF to TNF receptors, resulting in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity. ENBREL  was launched in November 1998 by Immunex. Amgen acquired the rights to ENBREL  in July 2002 as part of its acquisition of Immunex. In the United States, ENBREL  is indicated for reducing the signs and symptoms and inhibiting the progression of structural damage in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the FDA approved ENBREL  for the following indications: for reducing the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and for reducing the signs and symptoms of active arthritis in patients with psoriatic arthritis.
As part of its acquisition of Immunex, the Company entered into a co-promotion agreement and co-development agreement with Wyeth. Under the terms of these agreements, Amgen and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL  in the United States and Canada and develop certain future indications of ENBREL  for use in these geographic territories. In return for these efforts, Wyeth is paid a share of the resulting profits on sales of ENBREL  , after deducting the applicable cost of sales, including royalties paid to third parties, and associated research and development (R&D) and selling and marketing expenses (see Joint Ventures and Business RelationshipsWyeth).
6 Table of Contents ENBREL  sales for the period from July 16, 2002 through December 31, 2002 were $362.1 million.
Kineret  (anakinra) Kineret  (proper nameanakinra) is Amgens registered trademark for its recombinant nonglycosylated form of the human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist. Kineret  blocks the biologic activity of IL-1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor, which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues. IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses including inflammatory and immunological responses.
In November 2001, Amgen received FDA approval and began marketing Kineret  in the United States for the reduction of the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, in patients 18years of age or older who have failed one or more disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. In March 2002, Kineret  was approved in Europe for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate alone. In May 2002, Kineret  was approved in Canada to reduce the signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis in patients 18years of age or older.
Worldwide Kineret  sales for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $69.9 million and $12.3million, respectively.
Product Candidates The Company focuses its research and development efforts on human therapeutics delivered in the form of proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecules in the areas of nephrology, oncology, inflammation, neurology, and metabolic disorders (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)Financial OutlookForward looking statements and factors that may affect AmgenOur product development efforts may not result in commercial products).
Nephrology A focus of the Companys R&D effort is in the area of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). HPT is a disorder that results from excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland. Symptoms of HPT include bone loss, muscle weakness, depression, and forgetfulness. Secondary HPT is commonly seen as a result of kidney failure, affecting a majority of dialysis patients. Primary HPT principally afflicts post-menopausal women. The Company has entered into a license agreement with NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NPS) for Amgen to develop and commercialize calcimimetic small molecules based on NPSs proprietary calcium receptor technology for the treatment of HPT. The Company has conducted separate phase 2 clinical trials for primary and secondary HPT with a second generation calcimimetic compound (Cinacalcet hydrochloride). In 2000 and 2001, data from phase 2 studies with Cinacalcet hydrochloride were presented demonstrating that treatment with small-molecule calcimimetics results in dose-dependent decreases in PTH levels and control of elevated calcium levels. A phase 3 clinical trial with Cinacalcet hydrochloride in secondary HPT is ongoing and enrollment has been completed.
Oncology Certain tissue growth factors are believed to play a role in tissue protection, regeneration and/or repair processes. Mucositis is a side effect often experienced by patients undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy and is characterized as the irritation or ulceration of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Amgen currently is conducting research with Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF) to prevent and treat mucositis. A phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the effects of KGF in decreasing the incidence and duration of oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy with autologous PBPC 7 Table of Contents transplantation was completed in the latter part of 2002. In January 2003, the Company announced that preliminary analysis of the data suggested that KGF reduced the duration and incidence of severe mucositis in those who received it, as compared to placebo.
In 2002, as part of the Immunex acquisition, Amgen and Abgenix, Inc. (Abgenix) have an agreement providing for the joint development and commercialization of ABX-EGF, a fully human antibody created by Abgenix. ABX-EGF targets the receptor for human epidermal growth factor, or EGFr, which is overexpressed on some of the most prevalent human solid tumor types, including lung, colorectal, pancreatic, renal cell, prostate, and esophageal. Amgen and Abgenix have a series of Phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate ABX-EGF for the treatment of several types of cancer In December 2000, the Company acquired the rights from Immunomedics, Inc. (Immunomedics) to develop and commercialize epratuzumab. Epratuzumab is currently being evaluated for the treatment of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL). Epratuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. Preliminary research and early-stage clinical trials showed epratuzumab has some level of anti-tumor activity, either directly or indirectly, against some B-cell malignancies. In July 2001, the Company initiated a phase 3 clinical trial. The phase 3 clinical trial was designed to evaluate epratuzumab for the treatment of low-grade NHL in patients who failed to respond, or who responded for less than six months, to rituximab, a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of certain types of NHL (see CompetitionCancer). In January 2003, the Company announced the closure of this phase 3 study as epratuzumab did not, as a single agent, provide sufficient benefit to meet protocol-specified criteria for continued evaluation using the regimen. A phase 1/2 clinical trial of epratuzumab in combination with rituximab to treat low-grade and aggressive NHL is ongoing. In 2001, the Company initiated a phase 2 clinical trial of epratuzumab in combination with rituximab in low-grade NHL patients and a phase 2 clinical trial of epratuzumab in aggressive NHL patients.
Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is implicated in the regulation of bone mass. Bone mass is maintained in the body by the regulation of the competing activities of bone forming cells (osteoblasts) and bone resorbing cells (osteoclasts). Cancer metastases (cancers which have spread from their original tumor site) to bone cause bone destruction, leading to fractures and bone pain. In preclinical studies, OPG has been shown to inhibit the osteoclast mediated bone destruction induced by invading cancer cells. The Company completed phase 1 studies with the initial molecule in its OPG program. Data from these studies validated the importance of this pathway in the pathology of bone disorders. The Company has selected a lead candidate and is currently conducting phase 1 studies in metastatic bone disease and a phase 2 study in osteoporosis.
Inflammation The inflammatory response is essential for defense against harmful microorganisms and for the repair of damaged tissues. The failure of the bodys control mechanisms for the inflammatory response results in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. In September 2002, the Company submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) with the FDA for the use of ENBREL  to improve physical function in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In October 2002, the Company submitted an sBLA with the FDA to further expand the use of ENBREL  to inhibit the progression of structural damage in psoriatic arthritis patients. The filing was based on the results of a 12-month, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. In December 2002, the Company also submitted an sBLA with the FDA supporting once-weekly dosing of ENBREL  . The filing was based on results from a phase 3 study demonstrating that patients treated with 50 mg of ENBREL  once weekly achieved similar efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics when compared to patients receiving 25 mg of ENBREL  twice weekly. Additionally, in January 2003, the Company submitted an sBLA with the FDA to expand the labeling of ENBREL  to treat ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory disease predominantly affecting the spine that results in pain and stiffness and can result in partial or complete fusion of the spine. The filing was based on the results of a phase 3 study of patients with active AS, who were treated with ENBREL  over a six month period. In January 2003, the Company announced positive results of a phase 3 clinical study assessing the efficacy and tolerability of ENBREL  in the treatment of 8 Table of Contents moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease which is characterized by chronic inflammation of the skin that drives the formation of skin plaques.
In addition, in October 2002, the Company submitted an sBLA with the FDA for the use of Kineret  to inhibit the progression of structural damage in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The filing was based on the results of a 12-month, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. In October 2002, the Company announced that the ENBREL  /Kineret  combination study was stopped as the combination resulted in increased safety concerns with no increased efficacy. The Company is in phase 2 development of a second generation inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor, pegylated soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor type 1 (PEG-sTNF-R1) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In 2001, the Company initiated a phase 2 clinical trial of PEG-sTNF-R1 in combination with Kineret  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This phase 2 clinical trial was stopped in February 2003 as the combination resulted in increased safety concerns with no increased efficacy.
Neurology and Metabolic Disorders The Company has discovery programs in neurological and metabolic disorders. Neurotrophic factors are proteins which play a role in nerve cell protection and regeneration and which may therefore be useful in treating a variety of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and also nerve injury or trauma. In 1999, the Company discontinued development of glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) after a phase 1/2 trial of GDNF in Parkinsons disease failed to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit. However, based on favorable phase 1 clinical data from investigator-sponsored research, the Company is currently in clinical studies of GDNF using a different treatment protocol for possible use in the treatment of Parkinsons disease.
Amgen continues to support investigator research in certain exploratory indications for Leptin which is a naturally occurring cytokine hormone secreted by fat cells that may act primarily at the hypothalamus to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. In 1995, the Rockefeller University granted the Company an exclusive license that allows the Company to develop products based on the obesity gene. The Companys clinical trials of leptin failed to show clinical efficacy in normal obesity and diabetes, and development of this molecule was subsequently discontinued in these diseases.
Immunex Acquisition On July 15, 2002, Amgen acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex in a transaction accounted for as a business combination. Immunex was a leading biotechnology company dedicated to developing immune system science to protect human health. The Immunex acquisition is expected to further advance Amgens role as a global biotechnology leader with the benefits of accelerated growth and increased size, product base, product pipeline, and employees. The acquisition is also intended to enhance Amgens strategic position within the biotechnology industry by strengthening and diversifying its (1) product base and product pipeline in key therapeutic areas, and (2) discovery research capabilities in proteins and antibodies. The results of Immunexs operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements commencing July16, 2002.
Each share of Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was converted into 0.44 of a share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash. As a result, Amgen issued approximately 244.6 million shares of common stock and paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash to former Immunex shareholders. Amgen also paid Wyeth $25 million at the closing of the merger for the termination of certain Immunex product rights in favor of Wyeth, as specified in the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters. In addition, each employee stock option to purchase Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was assumed by Amgen and converted into an option to purchase Amgen common stock based on the terms specified in the merger agreement. As a result, approximately 22.4 million options to purchase Amgen common stock were assumed, on a converted basis. The acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
9 Table of Contents The purchase price of approximately $17.8 billion was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amounted to approximately $9.8 billion and was allocated to goodwill.
In May 2002, Immunex entered into an agreement to sell certain assets used in connection with its Leukine  business to Schering AG Germany (Schering) for approximately $389.9 million in cash plus the payment of additional cash consideration upon achievement of certain milestones. The sale of the Leukine  business was pursued in connection with Amgens acquisition of Immunex and was completed on July 17, 2002. In December2002, the Company licensed the commercialization rights for Novantrone  in the United States to Serono S.A. in exchange for royalties based on future product sales. Also, in connection with the acquisition, the Company initiated an integration plan to consolidate and restructure certain functions and operations of the pre-acquisition Immunex primarily consisting of the termination and relocation of certain Immunex personnel, termination of certain duplicative and non-strategic Immunex R&D programs, and consolidation of certain Immunex leased facilities. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Immunex acquisition and the related purchase price allocation.
Joint Ventures and Business Relationships The Company generally manufactures and markets its products. From time to time, the Company may enter into joint ventures and other business relationships to provide additional manufacturing, marketing and product development capabilities. In addition to internal R&D efforts, the Company has acquired certain product and technology rights and has established R&D collaborations.
Wyeth Prior to the acquisition of Immunex, Wyeth and Immunex were parties to several agreements relating to business and corporate governance matters. As a result of the acquisition, some of these agreements were terminated, however, some agreements have survived the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, Amgen entered into an agreement with Wyeth to amend and restate an existing long-term ENBREL  co-promotion agreement between Wyeth and Immunex.
Under the amended and restated co-promotion agreement, Wyeth and Amgen market and sell ENBREL  to all appropriate customer segments in the United States and Canada for all approved indications other than oncology. The rights to promote ENBREL  in the United States and Canada for oncology indications are reserved to Amgen.
Under the amended and restated co-promotion agreement, an ENBREL  management committee comprised of equal representation from Wyeth and Amgen is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL  including strategic planning, approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and establishing an ENBREL  brand team. The ENBREL  brand team, with equal representation from each party, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan and is responsible for all sales activities. The agreement provides that Wyeth and Amgen:  have primary tactical execution responsibility for specific activities identified within the agreement or as directed by the management committee  are required to maintain a minimum level of financial commitment to promoting and marketing and a minimum number of sales personnel for ENBREL  as established from time to time by the management committee  pay a defined percentage of all selling and marketing expenses approved by the management committee 10 Table of Contents The amended and restated co-promotion agreement further provides that Amgen:  pays Wyeth a percentage of the annual gross profits of ENBREL  in the United States and Canada attributable to all indications for ENBREL  , other than oncology indications, on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, Amgen maintains a majority share of ENBREL  profits  is entitled to keep all of the gross profits attributable to any future United States or Canadian oncology indications for ENBREL   pays Wyeth specified residual royalties on a declining scale based on net sales of ENBREL  in the United States and Canada in the three years following the expiration or termination of Wyeths detailing and promotion of ENBREL  Under the co-promotion agreement between the parties, Wyeth has agreed to reimburse Amgen for a defined percentage of the clinical and regulatory expenses Amgen incurs in connection with the filing and approval of any new indications for ENBREL  in the United States and Canada, excluding oncology and rheumatoid arthritis indications. The Wyeth reimbursement for clinical and regulatory expenses under this agreement, a portion of which is payable upon regulatory filing of any new indication and the remainder of which will be payable upon regulatory approval of any new indication, if any, applies for that part of the United States and Canadas clinical and regulatory expenses for ENBREL  for which Amgen would otherwise be financially responsible under the cost-sharing provisions in the pre-existing co-development agreement. Wyeth will also provide reimbursement for a defined percentage of specified patent expenses related to ENBREL  , including any up-front license fees, as well as patent litigation and interference expenses.
Subject to specified limitations, Wyeth will also be responsible for a defined percentage of the liabilities, costs, and expenses associated with the manufacture, use, or sale of ENBREL  in the United States and Canada.
Immunex and Wyeth have also entered into a collaboration and global supply agreement related to the manufacture, supply, inventory, and allocation of defined supplies of ENBREL  produced at the Rhode Island manufacturing facility, and a new Rhode Island manufacturing facility under construction as well as particular supplies of ENBREL  produced by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (BI Pharma) in Germany and Wyeth at a manufacturing facility Wyeth is constructing in Ireland.
Johnson & Johnson Amgen granted Johnson & Johnson a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis. In the United States, all recombinant human erythropoietin sold by Johnson & Johnson is manufactured by Amgen and sold by Johnson & Johnson under the trademark PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa). PROCRIT  brand Epoetin alfa is identical to EPOGEN  brand Epoetin alfa, which is manufactured by Amgen and sold by Amgen in the United States dialysis market. Pursuant to the license agreement with Johnson & Johnson, the Company earns a 10% royalty on sales of PROCRIT  by Johnson & Johnson in the United States. Outside the United States, with the exception of the Peoples Republic of China and Japan, Johnson & Johnson was granted rights to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic for all uses under a licensing agreement with Kirin-Amgen. With respect to its sales outside of the United States, Johnson & Johnson manufactures its own brand of Epoetin alfa which is then sold throughout the world by Johnson & Johnson under various trademarks such as EPREX  and ERYPO  . The Company is not involved in the manufacture of Epoetin alfa sold by Johnson & Johnson outside of the UnitedStates.
Kirin Brewery Company, Limited The Company formed a 50-50 joint venture (Kirin-Amgen) with Kirin in 1984. Kirin-Amgen develops and commercializes certain of the Companys and Kirins technologies which have been transferred to this joint venture. Kirin-Amgen has given exclusive licenses to Amgen to manufacture and market: 1) recombinant human 11 Table of Contents erythropoietin in the United States, 2) darbepoetin alfa in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries, and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, and 3) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Kirin-Amgen has also licensed to Amgen and Kirin the rights to develop darbepoetin alfa.
Kirin-Amgen has also given exclusive licenses to Kirin to manufacture and market: 1) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan, 2) darbepoetin alfa in Japan, the Peoples Republic of China, Taiwan, Korea, and certain other countries in Southeast Asia, and 3) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Kirin markets recombinant human erythropoietin and G-CSF in the Peoples Republic of China under a separate agreement. Kirin markets its recombinant human erythropoietin product in Japan under the trademark ESPO  . Kirin markets its G-CSF product in its respective territories under the trademark GRAN  . Kirin-Amgen has licensed to Johnson & Johnson rights to recombinant human erythropoietin in certain geographic areas of the world (see Johnson & Johnson). Under its agreement with Kirin-Amgen, Johnson & Johnson pays a royalty to Kirin-Amgen based on sales. Kirin-Amgen and Roche have an agreement to commercialize Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in those territories not licensed to either Amgen or Kirin as described above. Under this agreement, Roche markets Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in these countries and pays a royalty to Kirin-Amgen on these sales.
In connection with its various license agreements with Kirin-Amgen, the Company pays Kirin-Amgen royalties based on product sales. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, Amgen paid Kirin-Amgen royalties of $168.2 million, $147.1 million, and $140.8 million, respectively, under such agreements,which are included in Cost of sales in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pursuant to the terms of agreements entered into with Kirin-Amgen, the Company conducts certain R&D activities on behalf of Kirin-Amgen and is paid for such services at negotiated rates, which is included in Corporate partner revenues in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, Amgen recognized $174.6 million, $210.1 million, and $221.0 million, respectively, related to these agreements.
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd In May 2002, the Company acquired certain rights related to the commercialization of NEUPOGEN  and GRANULOKINE  (Filgrastim) and pegfilgrastim in the EU, Switzerland, and Norway from Roche. Roche will continue as the licensee for Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in certain countries outside the United States and the EU (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Prior to the acquisition of these commercialization rights, Amgen and Roche had an agreement providing for the commercialization of Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in the EU. Under this agreement, the companies collaborated in the EU on the commercialization and further clinical development of the product, and Amgen had a majority share in the related costs and profits from sales. Amgen had substantially all of the responsibilities for marketing, promotion, distribution, and other key functions relating to product sales, and primarily distributed the product to the EU countries from its European Logistics Center in Breda, The Netherlands.
ENBREL  manufacturing relationships In November 1998, Immunex and Wyeth entered into a long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma to manufacture commercial quantities of ENBREL  . Amgens supply of ENBREL  is largely dependent on product manufactured by BI Pharma. Amgen has made significant purchase commitments to BI Pharma (see MD&ALiquidity and Capital ResourcesContractual obligations). Under the supply agreement, BI Pharma has reserved a specified level of production capacity for ENBREL  , and Amgens purchase commitments for ENBREL  are manufactured from that reserved production capacity. Amgen is required to submit a rolling three-year forecast for manufacturing the bulk drug for ENBREL  , and a rolling forecast for a shorter period for 12 Table of Contents the number of finished vials of ENBREL  to be manufactured from the bulk drug. Amgen has submitted firm orders for the maximum production capacity that BI Pharma currently has reserved for ENBREL  . Amgen will be responsible for substantial payments to BI Pharma if Amgen fails to use a specified percentage of the production capacity that BI Pharma has reserved for ENBREL  each calendar year, or if the BI Pharma supply agreement is terminated prematurely under specified conditions. In June 2000, Immunex, Wyeth and BI Pharma amended the BI Pharma supply agreement to offer BI Pharma financial incentives to provide additional near- term production capacity for ENBREL  , to facilitate process improvements for ENBREL  , and to extend the term of the agreement (see Wyeth). The parties further amended the ENBREL  supply agreement as of June2002, to reflect the transfer of production to a new BI Pharma manufacturing facility, to provide for the use of an improved manufacturing process, to extend the term of the agreement, and to offer BI Pharma additional financial incentives to provide additional near-term production capacity for ENBREL  . A significant portion of all finished dosage forms of ENBREL  are currently manufactured by BI Pharma. Amgen also relies on a third-party contract manufacturer to perform fill and finish services for ENBREL  that is manufactured at its Rhode Island manufacturing facility, as well as a third-party to perform packaging services for ENBREL  manufactured by BI Pharma and at the Companys Rhode Island facility. The third-party fill and finish plant was approved by the FDA in December 2002. In December 2002, the parties again amended the ENBREL  supply agreement to take advantage of additional ENBREL  production capacity made available by BI Pharma.
In April 2002, Immunex announced that it had entered into a manufacturing agreement with Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) to produce ENBREL  at Genentechs manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, California. The manufacturing facility is subject to FDA approval, which the parties hope to obtain in 2004. Upon approval, the Genentech facility will become a licensed manufacturing site for commercial supply of ENBREL  . Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech will produce ENBREL  through 2005, with an extension through 2006 by mutual agreement.
Other In 2002, as part of the Immunex acquisition, Amgen and Abgenix have an agreement providing for the joint development and commercialization of ABX-EGF. Under the agreement, development and commercialization costs are shared equally, as would any potential profits from sales of ABX-EGF. Amgen and Abgenix are responsible for the ongoing and future phase 2 clinical trials and Amgen has primary responsibility for future phase 3 clinical trials. If clinical trials for ABX-EGF are successful and regulatory approval is received, Amgen would play the primary role in implementing marketing and product launch activities for ABX-EGF, while Abgenix will participate in co-promotion.
In June 2001, Amgen licensed to InterMune the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize INFERGEN  , as well as an early stage pegylated interferon product candidate being developed by Amgen, in the United States and Canada. Pursuant to the license agreement, Amgen supplies INFERGEN  to InterMune. In 1996, Amgen licensed to Yamanouchi the rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Interferon alfacon-1 for the treatment of hepatitis C viral infection and any additional indications around the world except in the United States and Canada. Amgen has earned certain milestones from Yamanouchi and will receive royalties on sales. Yamanouchi has granted to Amgen certain co-development and co-promotion/co-marketing rights in Japan.
In 2000, Amgen licensed epratuzumab, a therapeutic antibody for the treatment of NHL, from Immunomedics. Under this agreement, Amgen has the rights to develop and commercialize epratuzumab in North America and Australia. Amgen has paid and will make additional payments if certain clinical and commercial milestones are achieved and will make royalty payments based on sales.
13 Table of Contents Marketing Amgen maintains a sales and marketing force in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and NewZealand. The Companys sales force markets EPOGEN  , Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  , ENBREL  , and Kineret  to healthcare providers including clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. The Company also markets certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising. ENBREL  is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada. The Companys customers primarily consist of wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products. With the exception of ENBREL  , the Company utilizes these wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing the Companys products to healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. With respect to ENBREL  , the Company primarily drop-ships wholesaler orders directly to pharmacies for end-users. The Company monitors the financial condition of its larger distributors and limits its credit exposure by setting appropriate credit limits and requiring collateral from certain customers. Sales to three large wholesalers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Sales to AmerisourceBergen Corporation were $2,084.4 million and $1,470.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales to Cardinal Distribution were $988.6 million and $535.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales to McKesson Corporation were $843.9 million and $459.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, sales to two wholesalers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. In 2000, sales to Bergen Brunswig Corporation were $1,233.4 million and sales to Cardinal Distribution were $445.2 million. Outside the United States, Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  , and Kineret  are principally distributed to wholesalers and/or hospitals depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched.
Amgen was granted exclusive licenses by Kirin-Amgen to market: 1) erythropoietin in the United States, 2)darbepoetin alfa in the United States, all European counties, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries, and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, and 3) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company has retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. Amgen has granted Johnson & Johnson, a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis. Johnson & Johnson markets recombinant human erythropoietin under the trademark PROCRIT  in the United States. Under the amended and restated co-promotion agreement with Wyeth, Wyeth and Amgen market ENBREL  to all appropriate customer segments in the United States and Canada for all approved indications other than oncology. The rights to promote ENBREL  in the United States and Canada for oncology indications are reserved to Amgen.
In the United States, dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN  by the federal government through the End Stage Renal Disease Program (ESRD Program) of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including Medicaid, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement rate is established by Congress and is monitored by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Most patients receiving Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  , ENBREL  , and Kineret  for approved indications are covered by both government and private payors health care programs. Therefore, sales of Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  , ENBREL  , and Kineret  are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. Primary reimbursement for ENBREL  is obtained from private payors. Generally, worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce health care expenditures, and to a lesser extent, competition. See MD&AFinancial OutlookForward looking statements and factors that may affect AmgenOur sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products.
14 Table of Contents Competition Competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and other companies that research, develop, manufacture, or market pharmaceuticals is intense and is expected to increase (see MD&AFinancial OutlookForward looking statements and factors that may affect AmgenWe face substantial competition, and others may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do). Some competitors, principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater clinical, research, regulatory, and marketing resources and experience than Amgen, particularly in the area of small molecule therapeutics. In addition, certain specialized biotechnology firms have entered into cooperative arrangements with major companies for the development and commercialization of products, creating an additional source of competition. The Company faces product competition from firms in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. Additionally, some of the Companys competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in R&D in areas where the Company is also developing product candidates, as more fully discussed below.
The introduction of new products or the development of new processes by competitors or new information about existing products may result in product replacements or price reductions, even for products protected by patents. In addition, the timing of entry of a new product into the market can be an important factor in determining the products eventual success and profitability. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, in some cases, the relative speed with which the Company can develop products, complete the testing, receive approval, and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to Amgens competitive position. Competition among pharmaceutical products approved for sale also may be based on, among other things, patent position, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, and price.
A significant amount of R&D in the biotechnology industry is conducted by small companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations. These entities may seek patent protection and enter into licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology or for the sale of products they have discovered or developed. Amgen also may face competition in its licensing or acquisition activities from pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies that also seek to acquire technologies or product candidates from these entities. Accordingly, the Company may have difficulty acquiring technologies or product candidates on acceptable terms. Additionally, the Company competes with these entities and with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel.
Nephrology Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia could negatively impact the market for EPOGEN  and Aranesp  . Aranesp  directly competes with other currently marketed products which treat anemia, including EPOGEN  and the recombinant human erythropoietin product marketed by Johnson & Johnson (see ProductsEPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa) and ProductsAranesp  (darbepoetin alfa)). Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Aventis) is developing gene-activated erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia (see Item 3. Legal ProceedingsTranskaryotic Therapies and Aventis litigation). Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) is developing epoetin omega for the treatment of anemia. Roche is developing a pegylated erythropoietin product for the treatment of anemia.
The calcimimetic program could face competition from products currently marketed by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott), Bone Care International, Inc., Genzyme Corporation, and Roche which treat secondary HPT. In addition, another product to treat HPT is currently being developed by Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Chugai).
15 Table of Contents Oncology Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy could negatively impact the market for Aranesp  . Aranesp  directly competes with other currently marketed products which treat anemia associated with chemotherapy, including the recombinant human erythropoietin product marketed by Johnson & Johnson (see ProductsEPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa)). In Europe, Aranesp  directly competes with other erythropoietin products marketed by Ortho Biotech/Janssen-Cilag/Johnson & Johnson and Roche in the oncology setting. Aventis is also developing its gene-activated erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia (see Item 3. Legal ProceedingsTranskaryotic Therapies and Aventis litigation). Baxter and Roche are also developing their products for the treatment of anemia in the oncology setting.
Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing neutropenia associated with chemotherapy could negatively impact the markets for NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  . NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  currently face market competition from a competing CSF product, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and from the chemoprotectant, amifostine. Potential future sources of competition include other G-CSF products, GM-CSF products, FLT-3 ligand, myelopoietin, PGG-glucan, promegapoietin, and progenipoietin, among others. Neulasta  impacts NEUPOGEN  sales as health care providers in the United States transition from administering NEUPOGEN  to Neulasta  . Since the launch of Neulasta  in April 2002, NEUPOGEN  patients have been converting to Neulasta  . This trend is expected to continue, and will impact future NEUPOGEN  sales (see MD&AFinancial OutlookTrends expected to impact future operations).
Chugai markets a G-CSF product in Japan as an adjunct to chemotherapy and as a treatment for BMT patients. Chugai and Aventis market a G-CSF product in certain EU countries as an adjunct to chemotherapy and as a treatment in BMT settings. Chugai, through its licensee, AMRAD, markets this G-CSF product in Australia as an adjunct to chemotherapy and as a treatment for BMT patients. Under an agreement with Amgen, Chugai is precluded from selling its G-CSF product in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
Berlex Laboratories, Inc., a division of Schering (Berlex) markets GM-CSF under the trademark Leukine  in the United States for BMT and PBPC transplant patients and as an adjunct to chemotherapy treatments for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and AML. Berlex is also pursuing other indications for its GM-CSF product including as an adjunct to chemotherapy outside the limited settings of ANLL and AML. Novartis AG (Novartis) markets another GM-CSF product for use in BMT patients and as an adjunct to chemotherapy in Europe and certain other countries. This GM-CSF product is currently being developed for similar indications in the United States and Canada. Nartograstim, a modified G-CSF protein, is sold by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd. in Japan.
Many companies are developing products that promote wound healing, soft tissue regeneration, and chemoprotection. Companies such as Human Genome Sciences, Inc., Genetics Institute, Inc., MedImmune, Inc., and IntraBiotics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are currently among many companies that are developing products, which could be potential competitors for KGF.
NHL is primarily treated with standard chemotherapy agents, monoclonal antibodies, or a combination of the two modalities. Epratuzumab could face competition from rituximab, another monoclonal antibody marketed jointly by Genentech and Idec Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Idec). However, it is also possible that epratuzumab may be used in combination with rituximab (see Product candidatesCancer). In addition, other monoclonal antibodies are being investigated for the treatment of NHL including those in development by GlaxoSmithKline plc (in collaboration with Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and Idec.
Currently solid tumors are treated primarily with surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy depending upon tumor type, stage of disease, and the status of the patients. The ABX-EGF program could face competition from products under development by Astra-Zeneca, Imclone/Bristol Myers Squibb/Merck KgA, OSI/Genentech/Roche, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline plc.
16 Table of Contents The OPG program could face competition from a product currently marketed by Novartis for the treatment of cancer metastases to the bone.
Inflammation ENBREL  , Kineret  and sTNF-RI could face competition in some circumstances from a number of companies developing or marketing rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis treatments. Current anti-arthritic treatments include generic methotrexate and other products marketed by, among others, Centocor, Inc./Johnson & Johnson, Abbott, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), Pharmacia Corporation (Pharmacia), Novartis, Aventis, and Sanofi-Synthelabo. In addition, a number of companies have cytokine inhibitors in development including GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pharmacia, and Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Amgen is currently developing ENBREL  for the treatment of psoriasis. If ENBREL  is approved for this indication, it may compete with products marketed by Biogen, Genentech, and Johnson & Johnson.
Research and Development Amgens product candidates come from internal research, acquisitions, and licensing from third parties. Amgens internal research capabilities include an expertise in secreted protein therapeutics. The Companys discovery program may yield targets that lead to the development of therapeutics delivered as proteins, small molecules, or monoclonal antibodies. Amgen has only recently entered the small molecule field. In July 2002, the Company acquired Immunex, a leading biotechnology company dedicated to developing immune system science to protect human health. Immunex was a leading biotechnology company with scientific expertise in the fields of immunology, cytokine biology, vascular biology, antibody-based therapeutics, and small molecule research. The acquisition is intended to enhance Amgens strategic position within the biotechnology industry by strengthening and diversifying its (1) product base and product pipeline in key therapeutic areas, and (2)discovery research capabilities in proteins and antibodies. To supplement the Companys small molecule discovery program, in December 2000, Amgen acquired Kinetix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Kinetix), a privately held company that focused on the discovery of small molecule drugs that inhibit protein kinases, a key class of biological regulators (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $1,116.6 million, $865.0 million, and $845.0 million, respectively. In 2002, the Company also recorded a $2,991.8 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) resulting from the Immunex acquisition (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2000, the Company recorded a $30.1 million write-off of IPR&D resulting from the Kinetix acquisition.
Government Regulation Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of the Companys products and its ongoing R&D activities (see MD&AFinancial OutlookForward looking statements and factors that may affect AmgenOur current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval).
In order to clinically test, manufacture, and market products for therapeutic use, Amgen must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated there under, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of the Companys products on a product-by-product basis. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, an investigational new drug application is filed with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, a three-phase human clinical testing program is then undertaken. In phase 1, small clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety of the product. In phase 2, clinical trials are conducted to assess safety, acceptable dose, and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the product. In phase 3, clinical trials are conducted to provide sufficient 17 Table of Contents data for the statistically valid proof of safety and efficacy. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. No action can be taken to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until an appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further clinical trials may be required to provide additional data on safety and effectiveness and are required to gain clearance for the use of a product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against the Company.
In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in the manufacturing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving clearance from the FDA, a material change is made in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review may be required. The Company also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that the Companys equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against Amgen, including the suspension of the Companys manufacturing operations.
In the European countries, Canada, and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the European countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all EU countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval.
The Company is also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. The federal government has published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain payment arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statutes. The Company seeks to comply with the safe harbors where possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of the Companys practices, it is possible that the Companys practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Amgens activities relating to the sale and marketing of its products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were to allege against or convict the Company of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company, including its stock price. The Companys activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities.
Since 1991, the Company has participated in the Medicaid rebate program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and under amendments of that law that became effective in 1993. Participation in this program has included extending comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (PHS) pharmaceutical pricing program. Under the Medicaid rebate program, the Company pays a rebate for each unit of its product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as a 18 Table of Contents minimum 15.1% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from the Company to any customer. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. The PHS pricing program extends discounts comparable to the Medicaid rebate to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of poor Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on the Companys reports of its current average manufacturer price and best price for each of its products to the CMS. The terms of the Companys participation in the program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in the Companys rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates (and interest, if any), if the Company were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information.
The Company also makes its products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the VHC Act), federal law has required that product prices for purchases by the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) be discounted by a minimum of 24% off the AMP to non-federal customers (the non-federal average manufacturer price, non-FAMP). The Companys computation and report of non-FAMP is used in establishing the price, and the accuracy of the reported non-FAMP may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws. Among the remedies available to the government for infractions of these laws is recoupment of any overages paid by FSS users during the audited years. In addition, if the Company were found to have knowingly reported a false non-FAMP, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect.
Amgen is also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. The Companys R&D activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, and various radioactive compounds. The Company believes that its procedures comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. Amgens research and manufacturing activities also are conducted in voluntary compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.
Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which the Company is subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The Companys present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations.
Patents and Trademarks Patents are very important to the Company in establishing proprietary rights to the products it has developed or licensed. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including the Company, can be uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. See MD&AFinancial OutlookForward looking statements and factors that may affect AmgenIf our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.
19 Table of Contents The Company has filed applications for a number of patents, has been granted patents, or has obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, anakinra, etanercept, consensus interferon and various potential products.

There can be no assurance that Amgens patents or licensed patents will afford legal protection against competitors or provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage. In addition, Amgens patents or licensed patents could be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or infringed or circumvented by others, or others could obtain patents that the Company would need to license or circumvent. Competitors or potential competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to proteins, small molecules, compounds, or processes competitive with those of the Company. Additionally, for certain of the Companys product candidates, competitors, or potential competitors may claim that their existing or pending patents prevent the Company from commercializing such product candidates in certain territories.
In general, the Company has obtained licenses from various parties which it deems to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use, or sale of its products. These licenses generally require Amgen to pay royalties to the parties on product sales. In addition, other companies have filed patent applications or have been granted patents in areas of interest to the Company. There can be no assurance any licenses required under such patents will be available for license on acceptable terms or at all. The Company is engaged in various legal proceedings relating to certain of its patents. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Trade secret protection for its unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to Amgen. To protect its trade secrets, the Company generally requires its employees, material consultants, scientific advisors, and parties to collaboration and licensing agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, the consulting relationship, or the collaboration or licensing arrangement with the Company. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to Amgens proprietary information.
20 Table of Contents The Company has obtained registrations of its EPOGEN  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , ENBREL  , and Kineret  trademarks in the United States. In addition, these trademarks have been registered in other countries. The Company also has trademark protection for its product name Neulasta  and is currently seeking registration of this trademark in the United States.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials Amgen has manufacturing facilities which produce commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  , ENBREL  , and Kineret  (see Item 2. Properties). Additionally, the Company supplies Epoetin alfa in the United States to Johnson & Johnson under a supply agreement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to accurately anticipate future demand for Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  , NEUPOGEN  , Neulasta  , ENBREL  , and Kineret  or maintain adequate manufacturing capacity (see MD&AFinancial OutlookForward looking statements and factors that may affect AmgenWe plan to grow rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted).
As part of the Immunex acquisition, Amgen entered into a long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma to manufacture commercial quantities of ENBREL  . Amgens supply of ENBREL  is largely dependent on product manufactured by BI Pharma. Amgen has made significant purchase commitments to BI Pharma under the BI Pharma supply agreement to manufacture commercial inventory of ENBREL  . Also as a part of the acquisition, Amgen assumed a large-scale biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in West Greenwich, Rhode Island (the RI Facility). Prior to the acquisition, Immunex and Wyeth had invested substantial sums to retrofit the Rhode Island manufacturing facility to accommodate the commercial production of ENBREL  bulk drug. Amgen also utilizes third-party contract manufacturers to perform fill and finish services for ENBREL  manufactured at the RI Facility, and packaging services for ENBREL  manufactured by BI Pharma and at the RIFacility. The RI Facility and the related third-party fill and finish facility were approved by the FDA in December 2002 (see Joint Ventures and Business RelationshipsWyeth).
Certain raw materials necessary for the Companys commercial manufacturing of its products are proprietary products of other companies, and in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in the Companys drug application with the FDA such that they must be obtained from that specific, sole source. The Company currently attempts to manage the risk associated with such sole sourced raw materials by active inventory management and alternate source development, where feasible. Amgen attempts to remain apprised of the financial condition of its suppliers, their ability to supply the Companys needs and the market conditions for these raw materials. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing of the Companys products are derived from biological sources. The Company is investigating screening procedures with respect to certain biological sources and alternatives to them. Raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, and/or recall could adversely impact or disrupt Amgens commercial manufacturing of its products.
Human Resources As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 10,100 employees, including: 1) approximately 110part-time employees, and 2) approximately 150 employees previously employed by Immunex who are on transition assignments for Amgen ending in 2003. Most of the employees retained from Immunex, receive additional compensation payable under the Immunex short-term retention plan, which employees may be eligible for through 2004. Of the total employees as of December 31, 2002, approximately 3,400 were engaged in R&D, approximately 2,200 were engaged in selling and marketing, approximately 2,500 were engaged in commercial manufacturing activities, and approximately 2,000 were engaged in other activities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue attracting and retaining qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet its needs. None of the Companys employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company has experienced no work stoppages. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

Genentech litigation On October 16, 1996, Genentech filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the California Court) for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,704,362, 5,221,619, and 4,342,832 (the 362, 619, and 832 Patents), relating to vectors for expressing cloned genes and the methods for such expression. Genentech alleged that Amgen infringed its patents by manufacturing and selling NEUPOGEN  . On February 10, 1997, Genentech served an additional counterclaim asserting U.S. Patent No. 5,583,013 (the 013Patent), issued December 10, 1996.
At a hearing held on May 29, 1998, the parties stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of claims with respect to the 832 Patent. The judge issued a final claim construction ruling interpreting the 362, 619, and 013Patent claims which, among other things, essentially limited the claim term control region to DNA taken from a single operon and not constructed from control elements derived from various operons. On October 12, 2000, the California Court entered Final Judgment in the Companys favor on the basis of no infringement. Genentech filed a notice of appeal. The parties filed briefs before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments were heard on October 9, 2001.
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision April 29, 2002 vacating summary judgment of no literal infringement and affirming Genentechs non-compliance with the local rules, thereby precluding Genentech from proceeding on a theory of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to determine the issue of literal infringement under a revised claim construction, as well as the validity and enforceability of Genentechs patents. The District Court issued an order dated January 24, 2003 denying the Companys Motion for Summary Judgment of No Literal Infringement. The District Court issued an order dated February 10, 2003 granting Genentechs Motion for Summary Judgment of No Inequitable Conduct, dismissing that defense with prejudice. A trial date has been set for September 2, 2003.
Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis litigation On April 15, 1997, Amgen filed suit in the Massachusetts District Court against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (TKT) and Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. (HMRnow Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., together with TKT, the Defendants) alleging infringement of three U.S. patents owned by Amgen that claim an erythropoietin product and processes for making erythropoietin. Amgen sought an injunction preventing the Defendants from making, importing, using, or selling erythropoietin in the United States. On October 7, 1999, Amgen filed an amended complaint, which added two additional patents to the litigation. Defendants amended answer asserted that all five of the patents-in-suit were not infringed, were invalid, or were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
Amgens motion for summary judgment of literal infringement was granted by the Massachusetts District Court on April 26, 2000 with respect to claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,955,422 (the 422 Patent). On May 15, 2000, trial began in the Massachusetts District Court. On June 9, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Defendants motion for non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,618,698 (the 698 Patent), removing the 698 Patent from this action. On July 21, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Amgens motion for judgment on the Defendants defenses of invalidity based upon anticipation and obviousness.
On January 19, 2001, the Massachusetts District Court ruled that claims 2-4 of the 080 Patent, claims 1, 3, 4, and 6 of the 349 Patent and claim 1 of the 422 Patent were valid, enforceable, and infringed by TKTs EPO product and the cells used to make such product. The Massachusetts District Court also held that claim 7 of the 349 patent and claims 1, 2, and 9 of the 933 Patent were not infringed, and that if infringed the claims of the 933 patent would be invalid.
25 Table of Contents On January 26, 2001, TKT and HMR filed a Notice of Appeal and on February 14, 2001, Amgen filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On March 22, 2001, Amgen filed an Amended Notice of Cross-Appeal to include claim 9 of the 698 patent. After the parties briefed the issues on appeal, oral arguments were heard on May 7, 2002 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
On January 6, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Courts decision that TKT and HMR infringe the 349 and 422 patents. The court further upheld the enforceability and validity of all of the asserted claims except for validity over two references which was vacated and remanded to the District Court. The court vacated and remanded to the District Court of Massachusetts for further consideration of (i) the finding of infringement of the 080 patent, (ii) the holding of non-infringement of the 698 patent, and (iii) the effect of two references on the validity of the asserted claims of the patents. On January 20, 2003, TKT and HMR filed a Combined Motion for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Federal Circuit regarding the courts affirmance of the validity of the asserted claims under 35 U.S.C.  112. On March 3, 2003, the Federal Circuit denied TKT and HMRs Motions for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc.
Average Wholesale Price Litigation Amgen has been served with complaints in ten separate civil actions broadly alleging that it, together with a large number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, reported prices for certain products that overstate the Average Wholesale Price (AWP), allegedly inflating reimbursement, including co-payments paid to providers who prescribe and administer the products. An additional civil complaint naming Amgen as a defendant has been filed against the Company, but not formally served upon the Company. In addition, Immunex has been served with eight civil AWP actions and has been named in a ninth complaint that has not been formally served upon Immunex.
The complaints assert varying claims under the federal RICO statutes, their state law corollaries, as well as state law claims for deceptive trade practices and common law fraud. The complaints seek an undetermined amount of damages, as well as other relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief. The cases include the following: Citizens for Consumer Justice, et al., v.

Johnson & Johnson arbitrations The Company filed a demand in an arbitration with Johnson & Johnson to terminate Johnson & Johnsons rights under a license agreement (the License Agreement) relating to certain patented technology and know-how of the Company to sell Epoetin alfa throughout the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics and to recover damages for breach of the License Agreement based on the Companys claim that Johnson & Johnson has intentionally sold PROCRIT  (the brand name under which Johnson & Johnson sells Epoetin alfa) into the Companys exclusive dialysis market. The trial commenced in January 2002.
On October 18, 2002 the arbitrator issued his ruling in the arbitration. He found that Johnson & Johnson had breached the License Agreement. While the arbitrator ruled that Johnson & Johnsons conduct did not warrant termination of the License Agreement, he found Johnson & Johnsons conduct was illegal. As a consequence, the arbitrator awarded the Company $150 million in damages.
On January 24, 2003 the arbitrator determined that Amgen was the prevailing party in the arbitration and ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay Amgens costs and expenses, including its reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by Amgen in the arbitration. On March 7, 2003, the Company filed a petition for recovery of its costs and fees in the amount of approximately $91.2 million.

On December 10, 2002, the parties to this litigation entered into a settlement agreement terminating the litigation whereby Amgen and Wyeth received a non-exclusive, worldwide license to the ZymoGenetics patents claiming immunoglobulin fusion proteins in exchange for a one-time payment to ZymoGenetics.
28 Table of Contents Securities Litigation Shareholder Litigation On December 14, 2001, David Osher, an alleged shareholder of Immunex, filed a purported class action on behalf of Immunex shareholders against the members of the Immunex board of directors (the Immunex Board) and Wyeth in King County Superior Court of Washington (the Washington Court). The complaint alleges that Wyeth and the Immunex Board breached fiduciary duties owed to Immunex shareholders by stalling the merger discussions with Amgen as a result of positions taken by Wyeth in the negotiations relating to its control of Immunex and its marketing rights in future Immunex products. The complaint further alleges that Wyeth and the Immunex Board were favoring their own interests and not acting in good faith toward plaintiff and the purported class. On March 25, 2002, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging that Wyeth and the Immunex Board breached their fiduciary duties owed to Immunex shareholders by approving the merger with Amgen with terms that do not allow consideration of competing offers and by failing to disclose to Immunex shareholders certain information concerning the benefits to be received by Wyeth and certain Immunex directors/officers upon the completion of the merger. The amended complaint further alleges that Amgen aided and abetted Wyeth and the Immunex Board in the breach of their fiduciary duties owed to Immunex shareholders by offering Wyeth and certain Immunex directors/officers disproportionate consideration for approval of the merger with Amgen. Plaintiff seeks: certification as a class action and certification of plaintiff as class representative; preliminary and permanent injunction against proceeding with, or closing, the merger or any transaction that improperly favors the interests of Wyeth; rescission of the merger if it is consummated; and an award of the costs including attorneys and experts fees.
On April 29, 2002, Immunex announced the settlement, which settlement is subject to court approval among other things, of three lawsuits against Immunex and certain of Immunexs former directors and officers, and in the Osher matter, against Amgen relating to the acquisition of Immunex by Amgen: (i) a suit filed by David Osher, on behalf of a class of Immunex shareholders, against Immunex, all former members of Immunexs board of directors, Wyeth and Amgen; (ii) a suit filed by Adele Brody, on behalf of a class of Immunex shareholders against Immunex, Wyeth, all former members of Immunexs board of directors and the marital community of each named individual; and (iii) a suit filed by Edwin Weiner, on behalf of a class of Immunex shareholders, against Immunex, Wyeth, all former members of Immunexs board of directors and the marital community of each named individual.
In connection with the settlement, (i) Immunex and Amgen agreed to reduce the termination fee payable by Immunex or Amgen under certain circumstances set forth in the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 16, 2001 between Amgen, AMS Acquisition Inc., and Immunex by $20 million, (ii) Immunex obtained an updated opinion from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated regarding the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view to be received by Immunex shareholders, and (iii) Immunex agreed to provide certain additional disclosures regarding the merger in a Current Report on Form8-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 30, 2002.
Stockholder Derivative Lawsuit On March 14, 2002, Linda Blatchly, an alleged stockholder of Amgen, filed a purported stockholder derivative lawsuit against all members of the Amgen board of directors (the Amgen Board) and nominally against Amgen in the Ventura County Superior Court of California. The complaint alleges, among other things, that, after the filing with the SEC of the Annual Report of Immunex on Form 10-K on March 8, 2002 which contained disclosure regarding the lease for the new Immunex facility in Seattle, the Amgen Board members breached their fiduciary duties to Amgen by refusing to renegotiate or terminate the acquisition of Immunex, failing to disclose the true value of the financial condition of Immunex and seeking to acquire Immunex without conducting adequate due diligence. The complaint seeks: a declaration that the Amgen Board members have breached and are breaching their fiduciary and other duties to Amgen and the Amgen stockholders; preliminary and permanent injunction against proceeding with the merger; an order requiring an independent evaluation as to 29 Table of Contents (a) the true worth of Immunex, and (b) if it is determined that the acquisition of Immunex is in the best interests of Amgen, requiring an adjustment of the merger consideration; compensatory damages against defendants in favor of Amgen; and costs including attorneys fees.
The plaintiff in the purported stockholder derivative lawsuit filed against all members of the Amgen board of directors has tentatively agreed to a dismissal without prejudice for no consideration.
Governmental Investigations According to press reports, approximately 20 pharmaceutical companies are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and/or state agencies related to the pricing of their products. Immunex has received notice from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting it to produce documents in connection with a Civil False Claims Act investigation of the pricing of Immunexs current and former products for sale and eventual reimbursement by Medicare or state Medicaid programs. Immunex Corporation also received similar requests from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state agencies. Several of Immunexs current and former products are or were regularly sold at substantial discounts from list price. The Company does not know what action, if any, the federal government or any state agency will take as a result of their investigations.

32 Table of Contents Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Acquisition of Immunex Corporation On July 15, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex Corporation (Immunex) in a transaction accounted for as a business combination. Immunex was a leading biotechnology company dedicated to developing immune system science to protect human health. The acquisition of Immunex is expected to further advance Amgens role as a global biotechnology leader with the benefits of accelerated growth and increased size, product base, product pipeline, and employees. The acquisition is also intended to enhance Amgens strategic position within the biotechnology industry by strengthening and diversifying its (1)product base and product pipeline in key therapeutic areas, and (2) discovery research capabilities in proteins and antibodies.
Each share of Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was converted into 0.44 of a share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash. As a result, Amgen issued approximately 244.6 million shares of common stock and paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash to former Immunex shareholders. Amgen also paid Wyeth $25 million at the closing of the merger for the termination of certain Immunex product rights in favor of Wyeth, as specified in the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters. In addition, each employee stock option to purchase Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was assumed by Amgen and converted into an option to purchase Amgen common stock based on the terms specified in the merger agreement. As a result, approximately 22.4 million options to purchase Amgen common stock were assumed, on a converted basis. The acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Unless otherwise indicated, the discussions in this report of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 and financial condition at December 31, 2002 include the results of operations of Immunex commencing from July 16, 2002. Comparisons are made to the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and financial condition at December 31, 2001, which include only the historical results of Amgen.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities The Company had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $4,663.9 million and $2,662.2million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2002, approximately $2.0 billion represents cash generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in such foreign operations (see Results of OperationsIncome taxes). If these funds are repatriated for use in the Companys U.S. operations, additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. The Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to the United States.
The primary objectives for the Companys fixed income investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return to the Company, consistent with these two objectives. The Companys investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.
Cash flows Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be the Companys primary recurring source of funds. In 2002, operations provided $2,248.8 million of cash compared with $1,480.2 million in 2001. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2002 resulted primarily from higher earnings, 33 Table of Contents excluding the one-time, non-cash write-off of in-process research and development, and depreciation and amortization.
In July 2002, the Company paid the cash portion of the merger consideration of approximately $2.5 billion upon close of the Immunex acquisition. Also as a result of the acquisition, the Company received:  cash and investments acquired from Immunex of approximately $940 million  proceeds from the sale of the Leukine  business to Schering AG Germany (Schering) of approximately $390 million Capital expenditures totaled $658.5 million in 2002 compared with $441.8 million in 2001. The increase in capital expenditures in 2002 resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, the Seattle inflammation research headquarters, and the Rhode Island manufacturing facilities.
The Company receives cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock by Amgen pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by Amgen pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $427.8 million and $277.7 million of cash in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of the Companys stock relative to the exercise price of such options.
The Company has a stock repurchase program primarily to reduce the dilutive effect of its employee stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2002, the Company repurchased 28.0 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1,420.4 million. In 2001, the Company repurchased 12.7 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $737.5 million. Stock repurchased in 2002 includes 11.3 million shares of common stock repurchased simultaneously with the issuance of the 30-year, zero-coupon senior convertible notes (the Convertible Notes, discussed below) at a total cost of $650 million. In June 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $2.0 billion of common stock through June 30, 2004. At the time of the additional authorization, the Company had approximately $257.1 million remaining under the previous authorized stock repurchase program. The amount the Company spends on and the number of shares repurchased varies based on a variety of factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which the Company is restricted from repurchasing shares. As of December 31, 2002, $1,842.1 million was available for stock repurchases through June 30, 2004.
Debt financing In March 2002, the Company issued $3.95 billion in aggregate face amount at maturity of Convertible Notes with a yield to maturity of 1.125%. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $2.82 billion. The original issue discount of $1.13 billion is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs were approximately $56.5 million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the notes. The holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes on March 1, 2005, March 1, 2007, March 1, 2012, and March1, 2017 at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to the purchase dates. In such event, the Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock (see Note 8, DebtConvertible notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
To provide for financial flexibility and increased liquidity, the Company has established several other sources of debt financing. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $200 million of unsecured long-term debt securities outstanding. These unsecured long-term debt securities consisted of: 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 under a $500 million debt shelf registration (the Shelf), and 2) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097. In 34 Table of Contents addition, the Company has $23 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.2% and mature in 2003, which are classified as current liabilities. The Companys outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moodys and A+ by Standard & Poors. Under the Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered under the Companys medium-term note program with terms to be determined by market conditions.
The Companys sources of debt financing also include a commercial paper program which provides for unsecured short-term borrowings up to an aggregate face amount of $200 million. As of December 31, 2002, commercial paper with a face amount of $100 million was outstanding. These borrowings had maturities of less than one month and had effective interest rates averaging 1.4%. In addition, the Company has an unsecured $150million committed credit facility with five participating banking institutions that expires on May 28, 2003. This credit facility supports the Companys commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit.
Contractual obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities which the Company cannot reasonably predict future payment. The following chart represents the Companys contractual obligations, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Lessthan 1year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years Morethan 5years Medium and long-term notes and commercial paper $ 323.0 $ 123.0 $  $ 100.0 $ 100.0 Convertible Notes (1) 2,917.8  2,917.8   Operating lease obligations 135.7 34.7 49.6 23.9 27.5 Unconditional purchase obligations (2) 1,343.4 302.1 530.1 204.5 306.7 Total contractual obligations $ 4,719.9 $ 459.8 $ 3,497.5 $ 328.4 $ 434.2 (1) Holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2005 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (accreted value) through the purchase date. The amount above represents the accreted value on March 1, 2005. The accreted value based on the 30-year contractual maturity is $3,950.0 million. In the event the Company is required to repurchase the notes, it may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock.
(2) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily relate to the Companys long-term supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (BI Pharma) for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL  . Amounts owed to BI Pharma are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL  and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved. The Companys obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.
The Company believes that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of debt financing are adequate to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support its stock repurchase program (see Financial OutlookLiquidity and capital resources). However, the Company may raise additional capital from time to time.
Results of Operations Product sales Product sales in 2002 primarily consisted of sales of EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), and ENBREL  (etanercept). In 2002, product sales were 35 Table of Contents $4,991.2 million, an increase of $1,480.2 million or 42% over the prior year. This increase was principally driven by Neulasta  , Aranesp  , and ENBREL  sales. Product sales for 2002, excluding sales from products acquired from Immunex, were $4,589.4 million, an increase of $1,078.4 million or 31% over the prior year. Product sales were $3,511.0 million in 2001, an increase of $308.8 million or 10% over the prior year. Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, wholesaler inventory management practices, foreign exchange effects, new product launches, and acquisitions.
EPOGEN  /Aranesp  In June 2001, the Company received approval to market Aranesp  in most countries in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. In September 2001, Amgen received approval in the United States for the same indication. In July 2002, the Company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market Aranesp  for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. In August 2002, the European Commission approved Aranesp  for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. Aranesp  was launched in several countries in Europe for this indication.
Combined EPOGEN  and Aranesp  sales for 2002 were $2,676.2 million, an increase of $526.2 million or 24% over combined 2001 sales. EPOGEN  sales for 2002 were $2,260.6 million, an increase of $152.1 million or 7% over 2001 EPOGEN  sales. The Company believes that EPOGEN  sales growth for 2002 was principally driven by demand, which includes the effect of higher prices and growth in the dialysis patient population. Worldwide Aranesp  sales for 2002 were $415.6 million, including U.S. sales of $284.7 million. The Company believes that worldwide Aranesp  sales for 2002 were driven primarily by demand, and reflect the benefit of receiving the oncology indication in the United States in July 2002.
Combined EPOGEN  and Aranesp  sales in 2001 were $2,150.0 million, an increase of $187.1 million or 10% over 2000 EPOGEN  sales. This increase was primarily due to higher EPOGEN  demand, which includes the effect of higher prices and growth in the dialysis patient population, and to a lesser extent, the launch of Aranesp  in the United States and Europe. The reported sales growth was negatively impacted to a slight degree by wholesaler inventory changes. Worldwide Aranesp  sales in 2001 were $41.5 million.
NEUPOGEN  /Neulasta  The Company launched Neulasta  in the United States in April 2002 to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. In August 2002, the European Commission approved Neulasta  for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. In January 2003, the Company commenced launching Neulasta  in Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement has been established.
Combined Neulasta  and worldwide NEUPOGEN  sales in 2002 were $1,843.1 million, an increase of $496.7 million or 37%, over NEUPOGEN  only sales in the prior year. The Company believes that the increase in combined sales for Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  for 2002 was primarily driven by demand for Neulasta  , which reflects the conversion of NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  and patient population growth. Combined sales also benefited, to a lesser extent, from wholesaler inventory changes and higher NEUPOGEN  prices in the United States.
Neulasta  sales in 2002 were $463.5 million. Worldwide NEUPOGEN  sales in 2002 were $1,379.6million, an increase of $33.2 million or 2% over the prior year NEUPOGEN  sales. In 2002, U.S. NEUPOGEN  sales were $1,041.7 million, a decrease of $8.9 million or 1% over 2001 sales. This decrease was 36 Table of Contents primarily due to lower U.S. NEUPOGEN  demand, partially offset by favorable wholesaler inventory changes. The Company believes that U.S. NEUPOGEN  demand declined at a mid-single digit rate from 2001. The decrease in U.S. demand was primarily impacted by the conversion of NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  , partially offset by higher NEUPOGEN  prices in the United States. The Company believes that, as demand for Neulasta  increased subsequent to its U.S. launch, U.S. NEUPOGEN  demand decreased at an accelerated rate due to the conversion of patients to Neulasta  . In the fourth quarter of 2002, combined Neulasta  and worldwide NEUPOGEN  sales were $514.0 million, an increase of 53% over worldwide NEUPOGEN  only sales in the prior year period. The Company believes this increase in combined sales was negatively impacted by a decline in U.S. NEUPOGEN  demand in the low-20% range, driven by conversion of patients to Neulasta  (see Financial OutlookTrends expected to impact future operations).
Worldwide NEUPOGEN  sales in 2001 were $1,346.4 million, an increase of $122.7 million or 10% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to worldwide demand growth, which includes the effect of higher prices in the United States.
ENBREL  The Company began recording ENBREL  sales on July 16, 2002, subsequent to the close of the Immunex acquisition. For the period from July 16, 2002 through December 31, 2002, ENBREL  sales were $362.1million. In 2002, ENBREL  sales were impacted by supply constraints.
Corporate partner revenues Corporate partner revenues were $200.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $51.7 million or 21% over the prior year. Corporate partner revenues include $174.6 million related to amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (Kirin-Amgen) in 2002. The overall decrease in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to lower revenues earned from Kirin-Amgen, and to a lesser extent, lower revenues earned under other collaboration agreements.
In 2001, corporate partner revenues were $252.0 million, an increase of $5.8 million or 2% over the prior year. Corporate partner revenues include $210.1 million related to amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen in 2001. The overall increase in corporate partner revenues was due to slightly higher revenues, primarily related to INFERGEN  , substantially offset by lower amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen.
Royalty income Substantially all royalty income earned by Amgen relates to amounts received from sales of Epoetin alfa by Johnson & Johnson in the United States for use in non-dialysis settings. Royalty income was $331.5 million in 2002, an increase of $78.8 million or 31% over the prior year. This increase was principally due to higher royalties earned from Johnson & Johnson relating to its sales of Epoetin alfa.
In 2001, royalty income was $252.7 million, an increase of $71.7 million or 40% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher royalties from Johnson & Johnson relating to its sales of Epoetin alfa.
Cost of sales Cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was 14.7%, 12.6%, and 12.8% for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 was principally due to the impact of higher manufacturing costs and royalty expense related to ENBREL  compared to Amgens other products. In addition, during 2002 the Company recorded the inventory acquired from Immunex at its estimated fair market value (see Note 3, Immunex acquisition to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in fair market value was recognized as cost of sales as the acquired inventory was sold. Cost of sales for 2002 reflects a charge of $38.7 million related to the 37 Table of Contents fair value adjustment to inventory, and $7.5 million of compensation costs payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan.
In 2001, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased from 2000 primarily due to reduced royalty obligations, substantially offset by the impact of the $39.5 million write-off of certain inventory in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Research and development In 2002, research and development (R&D) expenses increased $251.6 million or 29% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and higher outside R&D costs, and to a lesser extent, higher clinical manufacturing costs as a result of the acquisition. In 2002, staff-related costs and outside R&D costs increased approximately $120 million and $90 million, respectively, excluding the impact of clinical manufacturing activities. In 2002, clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $38 million. Staff-related costs in 2002 include approximately $18.1 million of compensation costs payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan.
In 2001, research and development expenses increased $20.0 million or 2% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs necessary to support ongoing research and product development activities, partially offset by lower clinical manufacturing and product licensing-related costs.
Selling, general and administrative In 2002, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $491.4 million or 51% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher staff-related costs and outside marketing expenses as the Company increased its support for newly launched products and ENBREL  , and to a lesser extent, higher outside services. In 2002, staff-related costs increased approximately $225 million, outside marketing expenses increased approximately $217 million, and other outside services increased approximately $34 million.
Staff-related costs increased in 2002 principally to support new product launches, from incremental expenses from the addition of Immunex staff, and approximately $14.8 million of compensation costs principally payable under the Immunex Corporate Retention Plan. Outside marketing expenses in 2002 increased principally due to the launch of new products, marketing costs related to ENBREL  , and the impact of the profit share with Wyeth under the co-promotion agreement (see Note 13, Agreements with Wyeth to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
In 2001, SG&A expenses increased $143.8 million or 17% over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses, staff-related costs, and consulting expenses as support for new product launches was increased. In 2001, outside marketing expenses and staff-related costs each increased approximately $60 million and consulting expenses increased approximately $20 million.
Acquired in-process research and development In the third quarter of 2002, the Company incurred a one-time expense of $3.0 billion associated with writing off the acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) related to the Immunex acquisition. The amount expensed as IPR&D represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model. For each project, the estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization. These cash flows were then discounted to a present value using discount rates ranging from 12% to 14%. In addition, solely for the 38 Table of Contents purposes of estimating the fair values of these IPR&D projects as of July 15, 2002, the following assumptions were made:  Future R&D costs of $500 million to $600 million per therapeutic area would be incurred to complete the inflammation and the oncology research projects, and future costs of $200 million to $250 million would be incurred to complete all other research projects. These estimates are net of any R&D costs that will be shared under collaborations with corporate partners.
The research projects, which were in various stages of development from pre-clinical through phase 3 clinical trials, are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 2003 through 2009.
The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results.
Amortization of intangible assets In 2002, amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition was $155.2 million. Amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives ranging from 7 to 15 years on a straight-line basis.
Other items, net In 2002, other items, net consisted of three items: 1) a one-time, non-recurring benefit of $40.1 million related to the recovery of certain expenses accrued in the fourth quarter of 2001 related to terminating collaboration agreements with various third parties, 2) a legal award associated with the product license arbitration with Johnson & Johnson of $151.2 million, and 3) a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50 million.
In 2001, other items, net primarily consisted of costs associated with the termination of collaboration agreements with various third parties, including PRAECIS PHARMACEUTICALS INCORPORATED and certain academic institutions totaling $203.1 million.
In 2000, other items, net consisted of two items: 1) a legal award associated with the spillover arbitration with Johnson & Johnson of $73.9 million, and 2) a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $25million.
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the 2002, 2001, and 2000 items.
Interest and other income, net In 2002, interest and other income, net decreased $24.5 million or 15% over the prior year. This decrease was principally due to higher realized losses related to equity securities and higher losses on foreign currency transactions. The decrease was partially offset by higher interest income generated from the Companys investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances. Higher average cash balances during 2002 offset the impact of lower average interest rates.
In 2001, interest and other income, net increased $22.5 million or 15% over the prior year. This increase was due to higher interest income generated from the Companys investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances, partially offset by lower interest rates in 2001 and higher gains on the sale of equity investments that occurred in 2000.
39 Table of Contents Income taxes The Companys effective tax rate was (103.3%), 33.6%, and 32.0% for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Companys negative effective tax rate for 2002 was primarily due to the pre-tax loss resulting from the write-off of IPR&D costs in connection with the Immunex acquisition which is not deductible for income tax purposes. Excluding the effect of the IPR&D write-off, the 2002 effective tax rate would have been 30.7%. This effective tax rate was lower than the 2001 effective tax rate of 33.6% primarily due to the Puerto Rico restructuring described below.
During 2002, the Company restructured its Puerto Rico manufacturing operations using a controlled foreign corporation. As permitted in APB Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company does not provide U.S. income taxes on the controlled foreign corporations undistributed earnings that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Therefore, the Companys effective tax rate for 2002 reflected the permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the United States.
In addition, the Puerto Rico manufacturing operations were entitled to a possession tax credit for a portion of 2002. This credit is capped based on the 1995 income level and expires in 2005. The higher effective tax rate in 2001 versus 2000 was a result of increased taxable income combined with the cap on the possession tax credit.
Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
EPOGEN  revenue recognition The Company has the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics, and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. Amgen has granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. Pursuant to this license, the Company and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other partys exclusive market, sometimes referred to as spillover. Accordingly, Amgen does not recognize product sales it makes into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and does recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into Amgens exclusive market. Sales in Amgens exclusive market are derived from the Companys sales to its customers, as adjusted for spillover. The Company is employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each partys spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. The Company initially recognizes spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjusts such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN  sales. However, such differences to date have not been material.
Immunex purchase price allocation The purchase price for Immunex was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. An independent third-party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in-process research and development, identifiable intangible assets, and certain property, plant, and equipment. Such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete 40 Table of Contents the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects, and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. The Company believes the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions. However, these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Additionally, estimates for the purchase price allocation may change as subsequent information becomes available.
Deferred income taxes The Companys effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S.taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in international operations based on the Companys projected cash flow, working capital, and long-term investment requirements of its U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact the Companys effective future tax rate.
Financial Outlook Liquidity and capital resources The Company currently estimates spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $1.3billion to $1.5 billion in 2003, which reflects higher spending on capital projects including the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, the Seattle inflammation research headquarters, and the new Rhode Island manufacturing plant, which will be adjacent to the existing manufacturing facility.
Results of operations In the future, the Company expects growth of its businesses to be driven by new products, primarily Neulasta  , ENBREL  , and Aranesp  (see Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen).
EPOGEN  EPOGEN  is approved in the United States for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. The Company believes EPOGEN  sales growth will come primarily from patient population growth and price increases. Patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. The Company believes future EPOGEN  sales growth may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government. EPOGEN  may compete with Aranesp  in the United States as health care providers may use Aranesp  to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN  .
Aranesp  In 2001, Aranesp  was approved in the United States, most countries in Europe, Australia, and NewZealand for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. In July 2002, Aranesp  was approved in the United States for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies. In August 2002, Aranesp  was approved in Europe for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. The Company has launched Aranesp  in several European countries and will expand into other countries as reimbursement is finalized.
The Company believes future Aranesp  sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: the effects of competitive pressures, penetration of existing and new market opportunities, and changes in foreign 41 Table of Contents currency exchange rates. In addition, future worldwide Aranesp  sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers, as well as the availability of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. For example, effective January 1, 2003, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted certain changes to its payment system that included a rule setting a significantly reduced reimbursement rate for Aranesp  for Medicare patients in the hospital outpatient setting. While we believe that this new rule is based on inaccurate information, we cannot predict whether we will be successful in correcting inaccuracies underlying this rule, or if such reimbursement changes for Aranesp  in this setting may impact reimbursement in other settings, by other payors, or for our other products. The hospital outpatient Medicare setting accounted for approximately 10% of our U.S. revenues of Aranesp  for the year ended December 31, 2002. U.S. sales of Aranesp  for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $284.7 million.
NEUPOGEN  /Neulasta  In January 2002, Neulasta  was approved in the United States to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. The Company launched Neulasta  in the United States in April 2002. In August 2002, Neulasta  was approved in Europe for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. In January 2003, the Company commenced launching Neulasta  in Europe on a country-by-country basis as reimbursement has been established.
NEUPOGEN  is approved in the United States to: decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in chemotherapy patients with non-myeloid malignancies (the same use for which Neulasta  is approved); to reduce the duration of neutropenia for patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; to reduce the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in patients with severe chronic neutropenia; for use in mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells for stem cell transplantation; and to reduce the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following chemotherapy treatment in patients being treated for acute myelogenous leukemia. NEUPOGEN  is approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia for these same indications as well as for the treatment of neutropenia in HIV patients receiving antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive medications.
The Company believes future NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  sales growth will depend on penetration of existing markets, the conversion of NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  , patient population growth, price increases, the effects of competitive products or therapies, the development of new treatments for cancer, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, future worldwide sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers, as well as the availability of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments and private insurance plans. Further, chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less NEUPOGEN  /Neulasta  . NEUPOGEN  competes with Neulasta  in the United States and Europe. The Company believes that U.S.NEUPOGEN  sales have and will continue to be adversely impacted by the launch of Neulasta  , however the Company cannot accurately predict the extent to which healthcare providers will use Neulasta  instead of NEUPOGEN  or the timing of this conversion.
ENBREL  As a result of the Immunex acquisition in July 2002, the Company acquired the rights to ENBREL  in the United States and Canada. ENBREL  is approved in the United States for: the reduction of the signs and symptoms in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA); treating moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile RA in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; inhibiting the progression of structural damage in patients with moderately to severely active RA; and for reducing the signs and symptoms of active arthritis in patients with 42 Table of Contents psoriatic arthritis. The Company believes that future sales of ENBREL  will depend on: limits on the current supply of and sources of ENBREL  , penetration of existing and new market opportunities, the availability and extent of reimbursement by third-party payors, the effects of competing products or therapies, and any potential adverse developments discovered with respect to ENBREL  s safety.
ENBREL  is currently marketed in the United States and Canada under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth and, accordingly, Wyeth receives a share of the profits from sales of ENBREL  . In late December 2002, the FDA approved the manufacturing facility and the related third-party fill and finish facilities. Because of these plant approvals, additional supply of ENBREL  is available to patients.
Trends expected to impact future operations Future operating results of the Company may be impacted by a number of factors. The following trends in our business are expected to impact our future liquidity and results of operations:  combined NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  sales are expected to increase; however, U.S. NEUPOGEN  sales are expected to continue to decrease due to conversion of patients to Neulasta   cost of sales as a percentage of product sales is expected to continue to increase due to higher manufacturing and royalty expense for ENBREL   SG&A expenses are expected to continue to be impacted by seasonal trends in the fourth quarter that increase expenses over the three prior quarters  non-cash amortization expense of acquired identifiable intangible assets, principally related to ENBREL  , will be approximately $340 million, pre-tax, on an annual basis Forward looking statements and factors that may affect Amgen This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, and conference calls. Words such as expect, anticipate, outlook, could, target, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, should, may, assume, continue, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We have based our forward looking statements on our managements beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied, or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, expenses, earnings per share, liquidity and capital resources, and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise.
The following items are representative of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements.
Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products.
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as state and federal governments, under programs such as Medicare 43 Table of Contents and Medicaid in the United States, and private insurance plans. Medicare does not cover prescriptions for ENBREL  . In certain foreign markets, the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls. In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of state and federal proposals that could limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs. In addition, we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the availability of governmental and/or private reimbursement for that product is uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our recently approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time; we believe that sales of Aranesp  and Neulasta  are and will be affected by government and private payor reimbursement policies. Effective January 1, 2003, CMS instituted certain changes to its payment system that included a rule setting a significantly reduced reimbursement rate for Aranesp  for Medicare patients in the hospital outpatient setting. While we believe that this new rule is based on inaccurate information, we cannot predict whether we will be successful in correcting inaccuracies underlying this rule, or if such reimbursement changes for Aranesp  in this setting may impact reimbursement in other settings, by other payors or for our other products.
If reimbursement for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our other current or future products, health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales or revenues which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, in the United States the use of EPOGEN  in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN  which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN  sales until the policies were revised.
Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval.
We conduct research, preclinical testing, and clinical trials and we manufacture and contract manufacture our product candidates. We also manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute, and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including Europe. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries regulatory authorities before we can market and sell our products in those countries. In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years, and after it is obtained, it remains costly to maintain. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, require changes in labeling of our products and mandate product withdrawals. All of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. We currently manufacture and market all our approved products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. Even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, ENBREL  is manufactured both by us at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility and by a third-party contract manufacturer, BI Pharma, and fill and finish of bulk product produced at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility is done by third-party service providers. BI Pharma and these third-party service providers are subject to FDA regulatory authority. See Our sources of supply for ENBREL  are limited. In addition, later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, including potential withdrawal of the products from the market. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have 44 Table of Contents violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend, or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply or indefinitely. In addition, if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.
If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.
The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. For example, we are involved in ongoing patent infringement lawsuits against Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (TKT) and Aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents. If we ultimately lose these or other litigations we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, we could be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology, or we could be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us.
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, and our other products and potential products. We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, and etanercept products as EPOGEN  , NEUPOGEN  , Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and ENBREL  , respectively. In the United States, we have been issued or obtained rights to several patents relating to erythropoietin that generally cover DNA and host cells, processes for making erythropoietin, various product claims to erythropoietin, cells that make levels of erythropoietin, and pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin. We have also been issued or obtained rights to U.S. patents relating to G-CSF that cover aspects of DNA, vectors, cells, processes, polypeptides, methods of treatment using G-CSF polypeptides, methods of enhancing bone marrow transplantation and treating burn wounds, methods for recombinant production of G-CSF, and analogs of G-CSF. We have been issued or obtained rights to U.S. and European patents pertaining to pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF). We also have been granted or obtained rights to a patent in Europe relating to erythropoietin, a patent in Europe relating to G-CSF, two patents in Europe relating to darbepoetin alfa and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins, and a patent in the UnitedStates and a patent in Europe relating to anakinra. We have been granted or have obtained rights to patents relating to etanercept in the United States that generally cover DNA (issued in 1995 and 2000); products (issued in 1999 and 2001); and processes for using (issued 1997). These patents have varying expiration dates, with the latest United States etanercept related patent expiring in 2014. We have been granted or have obtained rights to patents relating to etanercept in Europe. The latest European patent relating to etanercept expires in 2011.
Limits on supply for ENBREL  may constrain ENBREL  sales.
U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL  is impacted by many manufacturing and production variables, such as the timing and actual number of production runs, production success rate, bulk drug yield, and the timing and outcome of product quality testing. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, Immunex Corporation, (the prior 45 Table of Contents owner of ENBREL  ), experienced a brief period where no ENBREL  was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma. Once supply of ENBREL  became available, Immunex resumed filling orders on a first come, first served basis. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of ENBREL  to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of ENBREL  , our ENBREL  sales will be adversely affected, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. See We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL  . and Our sources of supply for ENBREL  are limited.
We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL  .
We currently manufacture ENBREL  at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL  supply as well as for the fill and finish of ENBREL  that we manufacture. BI Pharma is currently our sole third-party supplier of ENBREL  ; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL  is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharmas production schedule for ENBREL  . We would be unable to produce ENBREL  in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharmas scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party manufacturers used for ENBREL  production were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to labor shortages or disputes, due to regulatory requirements or action, or due to contamination of product lots or product recalls. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL  , which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Factors that will affect our actual supply of ENBREL  at any time include, without limitation, the following:  BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL  continuously; rather, it produces the drug through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharmas production runs, level of production yields and success rates, timing and outcome of product quality testing, and the amount of vialing capacity.
BI Pharma schedules the vialing production runs for ENBREL  in advance, based on the expected timing and yield of bulk drug production runs. Therefore, if BI Pharma realizes production yields beyond expected levels, or provides additional manufacturing capacity of ENBREL  , it may not have sufficient vialing capacity for all of the ENBREL  bulk drug that it produces. As a result, even if we are able to increase our supply of ENBREL  bulk drug, BI Pharma may not be able to fill and finish the extra bulk drug in time to prevent any supply interruptions.
In addition, we are dependent on third parties for fill and finish of ENBREL  bulk drug manufactured at our Rhode Island facility. If third-party fill and finish service providers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or otherwise unable to provide services to us, then supply of ENBREL  could be adversely affected. See Limits on supply for ENBREL  may constrain ENBREL  sales, and Our sources of supply for ENBREL  are limited.
Our sources of supply for ENBREL  are limited.
ENBREL  supply for the United States and Canada is produced by us at our Rhode Island facility and by BI Pharma, currently our sole source third-party supplier. See We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of ENBREL  . In addition, our current plan includes construction of a new large-scale cell culture commercial manufacturing facility at the site of the current Rhode Island manufacturing facility. We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) to produce ENBREL  at Genentechs manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, California. The manufacturing facility is subject to FDA approval, which the parties hope to obtain in 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech will produce ENBREL  through 2005, with an extension through 2006 by mutual agreement. In addition, Wyeth is constructing a new manufacturing facility in Ireland, which is expected to increase the U.S.
46 Table of Contents and Canadian supply of ENBREL  . If additional manufacturing capacity at the Rhode Island site, or pursuant to the Genentech agreement, or if the Ireland manufacturing facility is not completed, or if these manufacturing facilities do not receive FDA approval before we encounter supply constraints, our ENBREL  sales would be restricted which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We face substantial competition, and others may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL  competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by Abbott Laboratories/Knoll, Centocor Inc./Johnson& Johnson, Aventis, Pharmacia, and Merck as well as the generic drug methotrexate and may face competition from potential therapies being developed by Biogen, among others. Further, we believe that some of our newly approved products and late stage product candidates may face competition when and as they are approved and marketed. For example, in the United States, Aranesp  competes with an Epoetin alfa product marketed by Johnson & Johnson in certain anemia markets and Kineret  competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by Abbott Laboratories/Knoll, Centocor Inc./Johnson & Johnson and others. Additionally, some of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we are developing product candidates. Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop, and market new products.
Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products.
Certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for fill, finish, and packaging of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices, and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the FDA approved that other supplier. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices, or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, or due to labor shortages or disputes. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including bovine serum and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating screening procedures with respect to certain biological sources and alternatives to them. Such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, and/or recall could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This too, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products.
We intend to continue an aggressive research and development program. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects produce a 47 Table of Contents commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results  the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness  the product candidate had harmful side effects on humans  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize  other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all  the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics Several of our product candidates have failed at various stages in the product development process, including Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (MGDF). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrigs Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products. Further, clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians, and others which may delay, limit, or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate. Also, the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product. We expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval.
We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.
If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products, and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.
For example, because ENBREL  has only been marketed since 1998, its long-term effects on the development or course of serious infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disease are largely unknown and more rarely occurring side effects may not be known. In May 1999, Immunex announced an update to the package insert for ENBREL  to advise doctors not to start using ENBREL  in patients who have an active infection, and for doctors to exercise caution when considering using ENBREL  in patients with a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections. In October 2000, Immunex again revised the package insert for ENBREL  in response to spontaneous adverse events reported to Immunex, including rare cases of hematologic and central nervous system disorders. The causal relationship between these adverse events and therapy with ENBREL  remains unclear. In January 2001, Immunex revised the package insert for ENBREL  to advise doctors that rare cases of central nervous system disorders, including seizures, and 48 Table of Contents rare cases of tuberculosis have also been reported in patients using ENBREL  . It is possible that additional spontaneous adverse events will be reported to us as experience with ENBREL  continues. If we or others identify new adverse events for patients treated with ENBREL  , additional precautions, warnings, or other changes in the label for ENBREL  may be required.
We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims.
Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products.
Our operating results may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations.
Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses, we assume that revenues will continue to grow; however, some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Because of this, even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a periods results to be below our expectations or projections. A revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, some of which we cannot control. For example, we may face:  lower than expected demand for our products  inability to provide adequate supply of our products  changes in the governments or private payors reimbursement policies for our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  increased competition from new or existing products  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in our product pricing strategies Of these, we would only have control over changes in our product pricing strategies and, of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period.
We plan to grow rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted.
We have an aggressive growth plan that includes substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing and facilities. Our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot control. For example:  we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control  we will need to attract and assimilate a large number of new employees  we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing organization  we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks.
49 Table of Contents Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment.
Our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is highly volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December 31, 2002, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $62.94pershare to a low of $30.57 per share. Our stock price may be affected by such factors as:  clinical trial results  adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products  actual or anticipated product supply constraints  product development announcements by us or our competitors  regulatory matters  announcements in the scientific and research community  intellectual property and legal matters  changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices  broader industry and market trends unrelated to our performance In addition, if our revenues or earnings in any period fail to meet the investment communitys expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price.
Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations.
The development, manufacturing, pricing, sales, and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval. and We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, or other sanctions or litigation.
Our marketing of ENBREL  will be dependent in part upon Wyeth.
Under the amended and restated co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL  in the United States and Canada. An ENBREL  management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL  , including strategic planning, approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and establishing an ENBREL  brand team. The ENBREL  brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan and will be responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to market ENBREL  effectively or if we and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL  may be adversely affected.
Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.
Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to 50 Table of Contents the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of concomitant therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.
We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with Immunex.
On July 15, 2002, we merged with Immunex Corporation. The success of our merger with Immunex will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings, and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of Immunex with the businesses of Amgen. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of Immunex. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:  consolidating research and development and manufacturing operations  retaining key employees  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  coordinating sales and marketing functions  preserving ours and Immunexs research and development, distribution, marketing, promotion, and other important relationships  minimizing the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns  coordinating geographically separate organizations In addition, even if we are able to integrate Immunexs operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the synergies, cost savings, or sales and growth opportunities that we expect or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame. For example, the elimination of significant duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies. We cannot assure you that the integration of Immunex with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger. Our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Item 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest income earned on the Companys investment portfolio is generally affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements on a portion of its available-for-sale investment portfolio, effectively converting these fixed income investments to variable income investments. The Companys short-term borrowings bear interest at variable rates and therefore, changes in U.S. interest rates affect interest expense incurred thereon. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the Companys medium and long-term notes and Convertible Notes because they bear interest at fixed rates. The following tables provide information about the Companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For the Companys investment portfolio and debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Additionally, the Company has assumed its available-for-sale debt securities, comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities, are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes. For the interest rate swaps, the tables present the notional amount and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity date. The notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract.

The amount above represents the accreted value on March 1, 2005. The accreted value based on the 30-year contractual maturity is $3,950.0 million. In the event the Company is required to repurchase the notes, it may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock.

These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. In 2001, the Company entered into equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of its equity investment portfolio. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of the unhedged portion of its equity securities was $82.8 million and $133.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, an adverse change in equity prices of 45% would result in a decrease of approximately $37.3 million and $60.0million, respectively, in the fair value of the unhedged portion of the Companys equity securities. Price volatility for equity investments is based on the volatility of a relevant market index for small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology sector.
The Company did not have material exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Non-employee directors receive annual grants of 16,000 shares in January of each year; inaugural grants to new non-employee directors are 60,000 shares. The exercise price of options granted under the 1991 Plan is equal to 100% of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the option grant. Formula stock option grants awarded to non-employee directors under the 1991 Plan vest and are exercisable: (a) on the date of grant, if the director has had three years of prior continuous service as a non-employee director, or (b) one year from the date of grant, if a director has had less than three years of prior continuous service as a non-employee director.

Stock Option Grants and Exercises The following table sets forth information concerning individual grants of stock options made by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2002, to each of the Named Executive Officers: Option Grants in Fiscal Year 2002 Individual grants Name Number of securities underlying options granted (#) (2) Percent of totaloptions granted to employeesin fiscalyear(5) Exercise or base price($/sh) Expiration date Potential realizable value at assumed annual rates of stock price appreciation for option term (1) 5% ($) 10% ($) Kevin W.

The assumed 5% and 10% annual rates of appreciation over the term of the options are set forth in accordance with SEC rules and regulations and do not represent the Companys estimates of stock price appreciation. The potential realizable value is calculated by assuming that the stock price on the date of grant appreciates at the indicated rate, compounded annually, for the entire term of the option and that the option is exercised and the stock sold on the last day of its term at this appreciated stock price. No valuation method can accurately predict future stock prices or option values because there are too many unknown factors. No gain to the optionee is 59 Table of Contents possible unless the stock price increases over the option term. Such a gain in stock price would benefit all stockholders.
(2) Options shown in the table have a term of seven years, subject to earlier termination if the optionee ceases employment with the Company or an affiliate of the Company (as defined in the Amended and Restated 1991 Equity Incentive Plan or other applicable plan). The vesting of all options will be automatically accelerated in the event of a change in control (as defined in the Amended and Restated 1991 Equity Incentive Plan or other applicable plan). In addition, the options are subject to, in certain circumstances, full or partial accelerated vesting upon the death or permanent and total disability of the optionee while in the employ of the Company or an affiliate of the Company, or death within three months after termination of employment, or voluntary retirement of an optionee after age 60 who has been employed by the Company or an affiliate of the Company for at least 15 consecutive years, (Voluntary Retirement), as provided in the option grant agreement, or at the discretion of the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the Compensation Committee) as permitted by the Amended and Restated 1991 Equity Incentive Plan or other applicable plan. Additionally, upon the Voluntary Retirement these options shall not terminate until the earlier of the termination date set in the grant agreement or three years following the date of Voluntary Retirement.
(3) Options vest and are exercisable as to 20% of the total grant on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of the grant.
(4) Options vested and became exercisable upon the date of grant, January 29, 2002.
(5) In 2002, the Company granted stock options covering a total of 16,949,622 shares of common stock to Company employees under all stock option plans maintained by the Company and this number was used in calculating the percentages.
Aggregated Option Exercises The following table sets forth information (on an aggregated basis) concerning each exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2002, by each of the Named Executive Officers and the final year-end value of unexercised options: Aggregated Option Exercises in Fiscal Year 2002 and Fiscal Year-End 2002 Option Values Individual grants Name Shares acquiredon exercise (#) Realized value($)(2) Numberofsecurities underlyingunexercised options atfiscalyear-end (#) Exerciseable/Unexerciseable Valueofunexercised in-the-money options at fiscal year-end ($) (1) Exerciseable/Unexerciseable Kevin W.

(2) Value realized is based on the market value of the Companys common stock on the respective dates of exercise, minus the applicable exercise price, and does not necessarily indicate that the optionee sold stock on that date or, at that price, or at all.
60 Table of Contents Change-in-Control Arrangements Effective as of October 20, 1998 (the Effective Date), the Board of Directors adopted the Amgen Inc. Change of Control Severance Plan (the CCS Plan) which provides certain severance benefits to persons who hold certain designated positions with the Company as of the date on which a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company occurs. If a Change of Control had occurred on December 31, 2002, the CCS Plan would have covered approximately 728 officers and key employees of the Company, including each of the Named Executive Officers. Under the terms of the CCS Plan, the CCS Plan extends through December 31, 2002, subject to automatic one year extensions unless the Company notified the participants that the term would not be extended no later than September 30, 2002. The Company has not notified participants that the term will not be extended, so the term has been extended to December 31, 2003, subject to possible further extension. If a Change of Control occurs during the original or any extended term, the CCS Plan will continue in effect for at least 36months following the Change of Control. Prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company has the right to terminate or amend the CCS Plan at any time; after the occurrence of a Change of Control, the CCS Plan may not be terminated or amended in any way that adversely affects a participants interests under the CCS Plan without the participants written consent.
Under the CCS Plan, a Change of Control generally will be deemed to have occurred at any of the following times: (i) upon the acquisition by any person, entity or group of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of either the then outstanding common stock or the combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or (ii) at the time individuals making up the incumbent Board (as defined in the CCS Plan) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; or (iii)immediately prior to the consummation by the Company of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not, immediately thereafter, own more than 50% of the shares of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (v) any other event which the incumbent Board, in its sole discretion, determines is a change of control.
Under the CCS Plan, if a Change of Control occurs and a participants employment is terminated within the two year period immediately following the Change of Control by the Company other than for Cause or Disability (each as defined in the CCS Plan) or by the participant for Good Reason (as defined in the CCS Plan), the participant will be entitled to certain payments and benefits in lieu of further salary payments subsequent to such termination and in lieu of severance benefits otherwise payable by the Company (but not including accrued vacation and similar benefits otherwise payable upon termination). In the event of such termination, the participant will receive a lump sum cash severance payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) a benefits multiple (either 3, 2 or 1, depending on the participants position (a Benefits Multiple)), and (y) the sum of (i) the participants annual base salary immediately prior to termination or, if higher, immediately prior to the Change of Control, plus (ii) the participants targeted annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs or, if higher, the participants average annual bonus for the three years immediately prior to the Change of Control; over (B) the aggregate value (determined in accordance with Section280G of the Code) of the acceleration of vesting of the participants unvested stock options in connection with the Change of Control. The terms of the Amended and Restated 1988 Stock Option Plan, the Amended and Restated 1991 Equity Incentive Plan, and the Amended and Restated 1997 Special Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan, Article II of the Amended and Restated 1993 Equity Incentive Plan, and Article II of the Amended and Restated 1999 Equity Incentive Plan contain the same definition of change of control as the CCS Plan definition, and such option plans provide for the acceleration of vesting of issued and outstanding stock options upon the occurrence of a change of control.
Participants who are senior executive-level staff members who are also members of the Amgen Executive Committee (which as of December 31, 2002, included each of the Named Executive Officers) have a Benefits Multiple of 3; participants who are senior management-level staff members at the level of director or 61 Table of Contents equivalent and above (and who are not members of the Amgen Executive Committee), have a Benefits Multiple of 2; and management-level staff members at the level of associate director or equivalent have a Benefits Multiple of 1.
The Company will also provide the participant with continued health and other group insurance benefits for a period of 1 to 3 years (depending on the participants Benefits Multiple) after the participants termination of employment. In addition, the participant will be fully vested in his or her accrued benefits under the Companys retirement plans and the Company will provide the participant with additional fully vested benefits under such plans in an amount equal to the benefits the participant would have earned under the plans had the participant continued to be employed by the Company for a number of years equal to the participants Benefits Multiple.

The plan was previously approved by Immunex Corporations shareholders. The 1993 Plan consists of two articles Article I which governs awards granted prior to July 15, 2002 (the Restatement Date) and Article II which governs awards granted on or after the Restatement Date. As the terms of options grants made pursuant to the 1993 Plan going forward are governed exclusively by Article II of the plan, the following is a description of the material provisions of Article II of the 1993 Plan. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 1993 Plan itself, which was filed as an exhibit to the Companys Form S-8 dated July 16, 2002.
Stock Subject to the 1993 Plan.
Subject to adjustments upon certain changes in the common stock, the shares available for issuance under the 1993 Plan are the Companys common stock. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 1993 Plan is 19,510,646. As of February 13, 2003, 385,049 shares remained available for future grant under the 1993 Plan. Awards of (i) incentive stock options, (ii) nonqualified stock options, (iii) stock bonuses, and (iv) rights to purchase restricted stock (Stock Award) may be granted under the 1993 Plan. If any Stock Award granted under the 1993 Plan expires or otherwise terminates without having been exercised in full, the common stock not purchased under the rights issued under Article II of the 1993 Plan shall again become available for issuance under the 1993 Plan.
Administration.
The 1993 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has delegated administration of the 1993 Plan to the committees of the Board and certain officers of the Company.
Eligibility.
Incentive stock options may be granted under the 1993 Plan to all employees (including officers) of the Company or its affiliates. All employees (including officers) and directors of the Company or its affiliates and consultants to the Company or its affiliates, or trusts for the benefit of such an employee, director or 68 Table of Contents consultant or his or her spouse or members of their immediate family (permitted trusts) designated by any such employee, director or consultant, are eligible to receive Stock Awards other than incentive stock options under the 1993 Plan.
For incentive stock options granted under the 1993 Plan, the aggregate fair market value, determined at the time of grant, of the shares of common stock with respect to which such options are exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year (under all such plans of the Company or any affiliate of the Company) may not exceed $100,000. No person may receive Stock Awards for more than 1,298,311 shares of common stock in any calendar year.
Terms of Discretionary Options.
The following is a description of the permissible terms of options under the 1993 Plan, other than options awarded to non-employee directors which are described below under the heading Terms of Non-Discretionary Options Awarded to Non-Employee Directors (the options described in this section are referred to as Discretionary Options). Individual Discretionary Option grants may be more restrictive as to any or all of the permissible terms described below.
The exercise price of Discretionary Options must be equal to at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the option grant. On February 13, 2003, the closing sales price of the common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market was $51.78. The exercise price of Discretionary Options must be paid either: (i) in cash at the time the option is exercised; or (ii) at the discretion of the Board, (a) by delivery of common stock of the Company that has been held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Companys earnings, (b) pursuant to a deferred payment or other arrangement, or (c) in any other form of legal consideration acceptable to the Board.
Generally, optionees may designate certain specified trusts as beneficiaries with respect to Discretionary Options. In the absence of such a designation, after the death of the optionee, Discretionary Options shall be exercisable by the person(s) to whom the optionees rights pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Generally, during the lifetime of an optionee who is a natural person, only the optionee may exercise the Discretionary Option.
The maximum term of Discretionary Options is 10 years. Absent death, disability or voluntary retirement in certain circumstances, Discretionary Options generally terminate three months after termination of the optionees employment or relationship as a consultant or director of the Company or any affiliate of the Company. Individual options by their terms may provide for exercise within a longer period of time following termination of employment or the relationship as a director or consultant.
Discretionary Options either become exercisable in cumulative increments or are exercisable in full immediately. The Board has the power to accelerate the beginning of the period during which an option may be exercised (the vesting date). Currently, options granted going forward under the 1993 Plan typically vest at the rate of 25% per year during the optionees employment or service as a consultant. Stock options typically provide for the acceleration of the vesting of options if the optionee voluntarily retires at or after age 60 after having been an employee of the Company or its affiliate for at least fifteen consecutive years and such retirement is not the result of permanent and total disability (Voluntary Retirement). Stock options granted in the future may be subject to different vesting terms. Generally, if any optionee shall terminate his or her employment or relationship as a director or consultant with the Company or an affiliate due to death or disability, then, in such event, the vesting date for those Discretionary Options granted to such employee, director or consultant or to the permitted trust of such employee, director or consultant which have not vested as of the date of such employees, directors or consultants termination for reasons of death or disability shall automatically be accelerated by twelve months for each full year of employment or relationship with the Company of such employee, director or consultant. Upon Voluntary Retirement, Discretionary Options shall not terminate until the earlier of the termination date set forth in the applicable grant agreement or three years following the date of Voluntary Retirement. The Board also has the power to accelerate the time during which a Discretionary Option may be 69 Table of Contents exercised. To the extent provided by the terms of a Discretionary Option, an optionee may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligations relating to the exercise of such option by (1) a cash payment upon exercise, (2) by authorizing the Company to withhold a portion of the stock otherwise issuable to the optionee, (3) by delivering already-owned stock of the Company or (4) by a combination of these means.
Terms of Non-Discretionary Options Awarded to Non-Employee Directors.
The Board may from time to time adopt award programs under the 1993 Plan providing for the grant of formula or non-discretionary Stock Awards to directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company or any affiliate. The terms and conditions of any such program shall be established by the Board in its sole discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of the 1993 Plan.
Terms of Stock Bonuses and Purchases of Restricted Stock.
Stock bonuses and purchases of restricted stock shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The following is a description of some of the permissible terms of stock bonuses and purchases of restricted stock under the 1993 Plan. Individual stock bonuses or purchases of restricted stock may be more restrictive as to any or all of the permissible terms described below or on different terms and conditions.
The purchase price under each stock purchase agreement shall be determined by the Board and may provide for a nominal purchase price or a purchase price that is less than fair market value of the underlying common stock on the award date. The Board may determine that eligible participants may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement must be paid in accordance with the same terms as Discretionary Options. See Terms of Discretionary OptionsExercise, Price, Payment.
Shares of common stock sold or awarded under the 1993 Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Board. To the extent provided by the terms of a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement, a participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligations relating to the lapsing of a repurchase option or vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award in the same manner that of Discretionary Options. See Terms of Discretionary OptionsEligibility.
Generally, rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall not be assignable by any participant under the 1993 Plan.
Adjustment Provisions.
If there is any change in the stock subject to the 1993 Plan or subject to any Stock Award granted under the 1993 Plan (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the 1993 Plan and outstanding Stock Awards thereunder will be appropriately adjusted as to the class and the maximum number of shares subject to such plan, the maximum number of shares which may be granted to a participant in a calendar year, the class, number of shares and price per share of stock subject to such outstanding Stock Awards.
Change in Control.
For purposes of the 1993 Plan, a Change in Control occurs at the following times: (i)upon the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of either the then outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or (ii) at the time individuals making up the Incumbent Board (as defined in the 1993 Plan) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; or (iii) immediately prior to the consummation by the Company of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not, immediately thereafter, own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the reorganized, merged or consolidated companys voting 70 Table of Contents securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, or a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (iv) the occurrence of any other event which the incumbent Board determines is a Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the vesting and exercisability of any outstanding Stock Awards under the 1993 Plan will accelerate. Upon and following such acceleration, at the election of the holder of the Stock Award, the Stock Award may be (a) exercised with respect to stock options or, if the surviving or acquiring corporation agrees to assume the Stock Awards or substitute similar awards, (b) assumed or (c) replaced with substitute Stock Awards. Options not exercised, substituted or assumed prior to or upon the Change in Control shall be terminated.
Duration, Amendment and Termination.
The Board may suspend or terminate the 1993 Plan without stockholder approval or ratification at any time or from time to time. Unless sooner terminated, the 1993 Plan will terminate on March 11, 2003. No amendment, suspension or termination may impair the rights or obligations under any Stock Award except with the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted.

The Amgen Limited Sharesave Plan The Amgen Limited Sharesave Plan (the Sharesave Plan) was adopted by the Board of Directors of Amgen Limited, the Companys indirect wholly-owned UK subsidiary, and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in October 1998. In general, the Sharesave Plan authorizes Amgen Limited to grant options to certain employees of Amgen Limited to buy shares of the Companys common stock during three-year offering periods through savings contributions and guaranteed company bonuses.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Amgen Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2002 1.Summary of significant accounting policies Business Amgen Inc. (Amgen or the Company) is a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as affiliated companies in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and exercises control over their operations (majority controlled affiliates). All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliated companies which are 50% or less owned and where the Company exercises significant influence over operations are accounted for using the equity method. All other equity investments are accounted for under the cost method. The caption (Earnings) loss of affiliates, net includes Amgens equity in the operating results of affiliated companies and the minority interest others hold in the operating results of Amgens majority controlled affiliates. On July 15, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of Immunex Corporation (Immunex) (see Note 3, Immunex acquisition). In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, Amgen has included in its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, the results of operations of Immunex from July 16, 2002.
Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers cash equivalents to be only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and which mature within three months from date of purchase.
Available-for-sale securities The Company considers its investment portfolio and marketable equity investments available-for-sale as defined in SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value (see Note 10, Fair values of financial instruments). For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, realized gains totaled $18.5 million, $13.3 million, and $32.4million, respectively, and realized losses totaled $14.4 million, $21.7 million, and $2.5 million, respectively. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair values of available-for-sale investments by type of security, contractual maturity, and classification in the balance sheets are as follows (inmillions): December 31, 2002 Amortized cost Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Estimated fair value Type of security: Corporate debt securities $ 1,708.7 $ 77.3 $ (0.2 ) $ 1,785.8 U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies 924.8 17.7  942.5 Other interest bearing securities 1,806.8 1.0 (1.4 ) 1,806.4 Total debt securities 4,440.3 96.0 (1.6 ) 4,534.7 Equity securities 68.9 60.6 (2.7 ) 126.8 $ 4,509.2 $ 156.6 $ (4.3 ) $ 4,661.5 F-6 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.

Investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return to the Company, consistent with these two objectives. The Companys investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Intangible assets and goodwill Intangible assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives ranging from 7 to 15 years on a straight-line basis.

Amortization of acquired product technology rights is included in Amortization of acquired intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Other intangible assets primarily consist of rights related to the commercialization of certain products (see Note 12, Acquisition of certain rights from Roche). Amortization of other intangible assets is principally included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Product sales Product sales primarily consist of sales of EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), and, commencing July 16, 2002, ENBREL  (etanercept).
The Company has the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. The Company sells Epoetin alfa under the brand name EPOGEN  . Amgen has granted to Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (which has assigned its rights under the product license agreement to Ortho Biotech Products, L.P.), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (Johnson & Johnson), a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. The license agreement, which is perpetual, can be terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties, or default. Pursuant to this license, the Company and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other partys exclusive market, sometimes referred to as spillover. Accordingly, Amgen does not recognize product sales it makes into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and does recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into Amgens exclusive market. Sales in Amgens exclusive market are derived from the Companys sales to its customers, as adjusted for spillover. The Company is employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each partys spillover based on estimates of and subsequent adjustments thereto of third-party data on shipments to end users and their usage.
F-9 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Sales of the Companys other products are recognized when shipped and title has passed. Product sales are recorded net of reserves for estimated discounts, incentives, and rebates.
Corporate partner revenues Corporate partner revenues are primarily comprised of amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (Kirin-Amgen) for certain research and development (R&D) activities and are generally earned as the R&D activities are performed and the amounts become due (see Note 2, Related party transactions). In addition, corporate partner revenues include license fees and milestone payments associated with collaborations with third parties. Revenue from non-refundable, upfront license fees where the Company has continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones, as defined in the respective agreements. The Companys collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success.
Royalty income Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded in accordance with contract terms when third-party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Royalty estimates are made in advance of amounts collected using historical and forecasted trends. Pursuant to the license agreement with Johnson & Johnson, noted above, the Company earns a 10% royalty on sales of Epoetin alfa by Johnson & Johnson in the United States.
Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, advertising costs were $49.4 million, $26.1 million, and $16.4 million, respectively.
Research and development costs Research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing R&D activities: salaries and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. Research and development expenses also include such costs related to activities performed on behalf of corporate partners. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Acquired in-process research and development Costs to acquire in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred (see Note 3, Immunex acquisition). Acquired IPR&D is considered as part of total R&D expense.
Derivative instruments The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, on January 1, 2001 and its adoption has not had a material effect on the Companys financial statements. SFAS No. 133 requires companies to recognize all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., unrealized gains or F-10 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through current earnings. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, all of the Companys foreign exchange forward contracts were adjusted to fair value through current earnings.
Periodically, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against possible changes in values of certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily resulting from sales outside the United States. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on these forward contracts are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest and other income, net in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. No portions of these foreign currency forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and there are no ineffective portions of these hedging instruments. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges were not material. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These forward contracts have not been designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133 and accordingly gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in interest and other income, net in the current period. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts were not material.
To protect against possible reductions in value of certain of its available-for-sale marketable equity securities and certain available-for-sale fixed income investments, the Company has entered into equity forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. The gains and losses on the equity forward contracts as well as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged equity securities are recognized in interest and other income, net in the current period. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, gains and losses on the portions of these forwards excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and the ineffective portions of these hedging instruments were not material. The terms of the interest rate swap agreements correspond to the related hedged investments. As a result, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, gains and losses on these interest rate swap agreements were fully offset by the losses and gains on the hedged investments.
Interest Interest costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent such interest is related to construction in progress, in which case interest is capitalized. Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, were $8.1 million, $12.7 million, and $12.3 million, respectively. Interest paid during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, totaled $24.2 million, $26.6 million, and $28.3 million, respectively.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Potential common shares are: 1) outstanding options under the Companys employee stock option plans including stock option plans assumed from Immunex, 2) potential issuances of stock under the employee stock purchase plans including the employee stock purchase plan assumed from Immunex, 3)restricted stock (collectively Dilutive Securities which are included under the treasury stock method when dilutive), and 4) common shares to be issued under the assumed conversion of outstanding 30-year, zero-coupon senior convertible notes which are included under the if-converted method when dilutive (see Note 8, Debt). Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes the potential common shares outstanding, as their impact is anti-dilutive.

The weighted average impact of these options was excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in 2002 because their effect was anti-dilutive as a result of the net loss. Options to purchase 17.3 million and 10.6 million shares with exercise prices greater than the annual average market prices of common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The weighted average impact of these options was excluded from the respective computations of diluted earnings per share for 2001 and 2000 because their effect was anti-dilutive.
Employee stock option and stock purchase plans The Company accounts for its employee stock option and stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under APB No. 25, no stock-based compensation is reflected in net income, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time. The following table illustrates the effect on net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (see Note 7, Employee stock option, stock purchase, and defined contribution plans): Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net (loss) income $ (1,391.9 ) $ 1,119.7 $ 1,138.5 Stock based compensation, net of tax 189.8 189.1 103.1 Pro forma net (loss) income $ (1,581.7 ) $ 930.6 $ 1,035.4 (Loss) earnings per share: Basic $ (1.21 ) $ 1.07 $ 1.11 Basicpro forma $ (1.37 ) $ 0.89 $ 1.01 Diluted $ (1.21 ) $ 1.03 $ 1.05 Dilutedpro forma $ (1.37 ) $ 0.86 $ 0.95 F-12 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Recent accounting pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, Asset Retirement Obligations effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Under the new rules, the cost to retire assets or remediate property or certain leased assets is capitalized and recognized as an operating expense over the life of the asset. The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for asset retirement obligations in the first quarter of 2003. The impact of adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The impact of adopting this standard has not had a material impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.
Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
2.Related party transactions The Company owns a 50% interest in Kirin-Amgen, a corporation formed in 1984 with Kirin Brewery Company, Limited (Kirin) for the development and commercialization of certain products based on advanced biotechnology. Kirin-Amgen has given exclusive licenses to Amgen to manufacture and market certain products including erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), darbepoetin alfa, and pegfilgrastim in certain geographic areas of the world. The Company currently markets certain of these products under the brand names EPOGEN  (erythropoietin), NEUPOGEN  (G-CSF), Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), and Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim). Kirin-Amgens revenues primarily consist of royalty income related to its licensed technology rights. Kirin-Amgen receives royalty income from Amgen, as well as Kirin, Johnson & Johnson, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche), and others under separate product license agreements for certain geographic areas outside of the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, Kirin-Amgen earned royalties from Amgen of $168.2 million, $147.1 million, and $140.8 million, respectively, which are included in Cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Kirin-Amgens expenses primarily consist of costs related to research and development activities conducted on its behalf by Amgen and Kirin. Kirin-Amgen pays Amgen and Kirin for such services at negotiated rates. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, Amgen earned revenues from Kirin-Amgen of $174.6 million, $210.1 million, and $221.0 million, respectively, for certain research and development activities performed on Kirin-Amgens behalf, which are included in Corporate partner revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
At December 31, 2002, Amgens share of Kirin-Amgens undistributed retained earnings was approximately $96.5 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 3.Immunex acquisition On July 15, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex in a transaction accounted for as a business combination. Immunex was a leading biotechnology company dedicated to developing immune system science to protect human health. The Immunex acquisition is expected to further advance Amgens role as a global biotechnology leader with the benefits of accelerated growth and increased size, product base, product pipeline, and employees. The acquisition is also intended to enhance Amgens strategic position within the biotechnology industry by strengthening and diversifying its (1) product base and product pipeline in key therapeutic areas, and (2) discovery research capabilities in proteins and antibodies. The results of Immunexs operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements commencing July16, 2002.
Each share of Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was converted into 0.44 of a share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash. As a result, Amgen issued approximately 244.6 million shares of common stock and paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash to former Immunex shareholders. Amgen also paid Wyeth $25 million at the closing of the merger for the termination of certain Immunex product rights in favor of Wyeth, as specified in the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters. In addition, each employee stock option to purchase Immunex common stock outstanding at July 15, 2002 was assumed by Amgen and converted into an option to purchase Amgen common stock based on the terms specified in the merger agreement. As a result, approximately 22.4 million options to purchase Amgen common stock were assumed, on a converted basis. The acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The purchase price of the acquisition was (in millions): Fair value of Amgen shares issued $ 14,313.0 Cash consideration (including payment to Wyeth) 2,526.2 Fair value of Amgen options issued 870.2 Transaction costs 62.4 Total $ 17,771.8 The value of the Amgen shares used in determining the purchase price was $58.525 per share based on the average of the closing prices of Amgen common stock for a range of four trading days, two days prior to and two days subsequent to the announcement of the merger on December 16, 2001. The fair values of stock options issued were also determined based on the $58.525 stock price using the Black-Scholes option valuation model assuming an expected weighted average life of 1.5 years, weighted average risk-free rate of 2.1%, volatility of 50%, and no expected dividends.
Purchase price allocation The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amounted to $9,773.9 million and was allocated to goodwill. The Company expects that substantially all of the amount allocated to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
F-14 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in millions): Current assets, principally cash and marketable securities $ 1,624.6 Deferred tax assets 200.2 Property, plant, and equipment 572.4 In-process research and development 2,991.8 Identifiable intangible assets, principally developed product technology and core technology 4,803.2 Goodwill 9,773.9 Other assets 26.2 Current liabilities (625.0 ) Deferred tax liabilities (1,595.5 ) Net assets $ 17,771.8 The allocation of the purchase price was based, in part, on a third-party valuation of the fair values of in-process research and development, identifiable intangible assets, and certain property, plant, and equipment. The purchase price allocation will remain preliminary until Amgen completes its evaluation of the various restructuring plans undertaken following the consummation of the merger, as discussed below. The final determination of the purchase price allocation is expected to be completed as soon as practicable after the consummation of the acquisition.
In the fourth quarter of 2002, goodwill increased by $53.9 million principally due to the impact of adjusting amounts previously accrued under the Companys various restructuring plans (see Restructuring plans below) and obtaining final third-party valuations of identifiable intangible assets.
In-process research and development Approximately $2,991.8 million of the purchase price represents the estimated fair value of projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations in the third quarter of 2002. The estimated fair values assigned to IPR&D is comprised of the following projects by therapeutic area (in millions): Value of IPR&D acquired Inflammation $ 2,160.1 Oncology 726.3 Other 105.4 Total $ 2,991.8 F-15 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model. For each project, the estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization. These cash flows were then discounted to a present value using discount rates ranging from 12% to 14%. In addition, solely for the purposes of estimating the fair values of these IPR&D projects as of July 15, 2002, the following assumptions were made:  Future R&D costs of $500 million to $600 million (unaudited) per therapeutic area would be incurred to complete the inflammation and the oncology research projects, and future costs of $200 million to $250 million (unaudited) would be incurred to complete all other research projects. These estimates are net of any R&D costs that will be shared under collaborations with corporate partners.
The research projects, which were in various stages of development from pre-clinical through phase3clinical trials, are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 2003 through 2009.
The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results.
Identifiable intangible assets Acquired identifiable intangible assets primarily relate to ENBREL  and include product rights for approved indications of currently marketed products and core technology. The amounts assigned to each intangible asset class as of the acquisition date and the weighted-average amortization periods are as follows (amounts in millions): Value of intangibles acquired Weighted average amortization period Developed product technology $ 3,264.5 14.5years Core technology 1,348.3 15 years Tradename 190.4 15 years Total $ 4,803.2 Leukine  and Novantrone  In May 2002, Immunex entered into an agreement to sell certain assets used in connection with its Leukine  business to Schering AG Germany (Schering) for approximately $389.9 million in cash plus the payment of additional cash consideration upon achievement of certain milestones. The sale of the Leukine  business was pursued in connection with Amgens acquisition of Immunex and was completed on July 17, 2002.
In December 2002, the Company licensed the commercialization rights for Novantrone  in the United States to Serono S.A. in exchange for royalties based on future product sales.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Pro forma results of operations The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of the Companys consolidated results of operations as if the Immunex acquisition had taken place at the beginning of each period presented (in millions, except per share information): Year ended December31, 2002 2001 Product sales $ 5,538.5 $ 4,470.6 Total revenues 6,078.2 5,002.5 Net income 1,486.9 953.1 Pro forma earnings per share: Basic $ 1.16 $ 0.74 Diluted $ 1.12 $ 0.71 The pro forma net income and earnings per share for each period exclude the acquired IPR&D charge noted above. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of results that would have occurred had the acquisition been in effect for the periods presented or indicative of results that may be achieved in the future.
The impact of the Leukine  sale noted above is reflected in the Companys purchase price allocation as of July 15, 2002. However, for antitrust reasons, information regarding the results of operations attributable to Leukine  is not reviewable by Amgen, and therefore, has not been excluded from the pro forma results of operations presented above. Leukine  sales from January 1, 2002 through July 15, 2002 were approximately $60million, and in 2001 were $108.4 million.
Restructuring plans In connection with the Immunex acquisition, the Company initiated an integration plan to consolidate and restructure certain functions and operations of the pre-acquisition Immunex primarily consisting of the termination and relocation of certain Immunex personnel, termination of certain duplicative and non-strategic Immunex R&D programs, and consolidation of certain Immunex leased facilities. These costs have been recognized as liabilities assumed in the purchase business combination in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3 Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with Purchase Business Combinations and reflected as an increase to goodwill. The following table summarizes the liabilities established as a result of the acquisition and payments made through December 31, 2002 (in millions): Restructuring liability Payments Balance at 12/31/02 Employee related benefits $ 65.1 $ (41.0 ) $ 24.1 Facility consolidation 31.2 (0.4 ) 30.8 Total $ 96.3 $ (41.4 ) $ 54.9 F-17 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.

These agreements were terminated primarily because the related collaboration activities and/or the underlying technology no longer met the Companys long-term research and development objectives. These costs include $102.4 million primarily with respect to amounts previously capitalized related to these agreements, and $100.7 million with respect to amounts to be paid to third parties in connection with the termination of these relationships. The amounts previously capitalized were comprised of the following: inventory associated with a product candidate that we expected to commercializeapproximately $40 million, receivable from a collaboration partnerapproximately $20 million, and equity investments, fixed assets and other assetsapproximately $42million.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a benefit of $40.1 million related to the finalization of the termination of certain of these collaboration agreements which resulted in the recovery of certain expenses accrued in the fourth quarter of 2001. The benefit principally related to the settlement of the Praecis collaboration agreement. At December 31, 2002, substantially all remaining amounts have been paid to the respective third parties.
Legal award, net In September 1985, the Company granted Johnson & Johnsons affiliate, Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a license relating to certain patented technology and know-how of the Company to sell Epoetin alfa throughout the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. A number of disputes have arisen between Amgen and Johnson & Johnson as to their respective rights and obligations under the various agreements between them, including the agreement granting the license (the License Agreement). The disputes between Amgen and Johnson & Johnson have been resolved through binding arbitration, with an arbitrator (the Arbitrator) presiding over both disputes discussed below.
License Agreement arbitration A dispute arose related to the alleged violation of the License Agreement by Johnson & Johnson. In October 2002, the Arbitrator issued a final order awarding the Company $150 million for Johnson & Johnsons breach of the License Agreement. The legal award of $151.2 million, which included interest, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002. Subsequent to year end, the Company was awarded reimbursement of its costs and expenses, as the successful party in the arbitration. The Arbitrator will determine the final amount of the Companys recovery F-18 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) of such costs and expenses. At December 31, 2002, no amounts have been recorded related to the reimbursement for costs and expenses.
Spillover audit methodology arbitration A dispute arose related to the audit methodology currently employed by the Company to account for Epoetin alfa sales. Under the License Agreement, the Company and Johnson & Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other partys exclusive market, sometimes described as spillover. The Company has established and is employing an audit methodology to measure each partys spillover and to allocate the net profits from those sales to the appropriate party. The Arbitrator issued a final order adopting the Companys audit methodology with certain adjustments and also found that the Company was the successful party in the arbitration. Pursuant to the final order, an independent panel was formed principally to refine the procedures for measuring the erythropoietin market as may be necessary.
Because the Arbitrator ruled that the Company was the successful party in the arbitration, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay to the Company the costs and expenses that the Company incurred in the arbitration as well as one-half of the audit costs. In July 2000, the Arbitrator issued a final order awarding the Company approximately $78 million in such costs and expenses (the Fee Award). As a result, the Company recorded a net $73.9 million legal award, which represents the Fee Award reduced by minor amounts related to other miscellaneous disputes with Johnson & Johnson, in the third quarter of 2000.
Amgen Foundation contribution In 2002 and 2000, the Company contributed $50 million and $25 million, respectively, to the Amgen Foundation. These contributions will allow the Amgen Foundation to continue its support of non-profit organizations that focus on issues in health and medicine, science education, and other activities that strengthen local communities.
5.Income taxes The provision for income taxes includes the following (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Current provision: Federal (including U.S. possessions) $ 457.0 $ 625.1 $ 475.3 State 15.9 78.3 47.5 Foreign 59.8 11.5 6.4 Total current provision 532.7 714.9 529.2 Deferred provision (benefit): Federal (including U.S. possessions) 146.1 (104.3 ) 9.6 State 28.6 (44.0 ) (3.0 ) Total deferred provision (benefit) 174.7 (148.3 ) 6.6 $ 707.4 $ 566.6 $ 535.8 F-19 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2002 2001 Deferred tax assets: Acquired net operating loss and credit carryforwards $ 246.0 $ 45.4 Fixed assets 215.3 29.3 Expenses capitalized for tax purposes 83.3 91.9 Expense accruals 82.7 105.2 Credit carryforwards 40.7 39.4 Other 36.2 28.8 Total deferred tax assets 704.2 340.0 Valuation allowance (22.6 ) (19.6 ) Net deferred tax assets 681.6 320.4 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquired intangibles (1,817.4 )  Foreign operations (106.7 ) (1.0 ) Purchase of technology rights (62.6 ) (85.9 ) Marketable securities and investments (56.5 ) (70.4 ) Other (39.8 ) (7.4 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (2,083.0 ) (164.7 ) $ (1,401.4 ) $ 155.7 At December 31, 2002, the Company had operating loss carryforwards of $532.5 million available to reduce future federal taxable income which begin expiring in 2008. The Company also had $59.6 million of credit carryforwards against which a partial valuation allowance was established. These operating loss and credit carryforwards relate to the acquisition of companies. In addition, at December 31, 2002, the Company had $40.0million of state research and experimentation tax credit carryforward, which has no expiration date.
The Company recorded gross deferred tax assets of $410.9 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $1.8billion as a result of the Immunex acquisition. The gross deferred tax assets were composed primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other temporary differences. The gross deferred tax liabilities were composed primarily of basis differences related to purchased identifiable intangible assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The reconciliation between the Companys effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate is as follows (amounts in millions): 2002 Amount Tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Statutory rate applied to income before income taxes $ (239.6 ) 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Acquired IPR&D 1,047.1 (153.0 )%   Foreign earnings including permanently reinvested amounts (106.3 ) 15.5 %   Benefit of Puerto Rico operations, net of Puerto Rico income taxes (17.2 ) 2.5 % (1.7 )% (2.0 )% State taxes 44.5 (6.5 )% 1.4 % 1.7 % Utilization of tax credits, primarily research and experimentation (33.5 ) 4.9 % (1.3 )% (1.4 )% Other, net 12.4 (1.7 )% 0.2 % (1.3 )% $ 707.4 (103.3 )% 33.6 % 32.0 % The Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of its foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested. At December 31, 2002, these earnings amounted to approximately $368 million. If these earnings were repatriated to the United States, the Company would be required to accrue and pay approximately $128 million of additional taxes based on the current tax rates in effect. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys foreign profits before income taxes were approximately $360 million. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, foreign profits before income taxes were not material.
The Companys income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service and various state tax authorities. While disputes may arise with these tax authorities, some of which may be significant, the Company believes that adequate tax liabilities have been established for all open audit years.
Income taxes paid during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, totaled $438.4 million, $516.2 million, and $141.3 million, respectively.
6.Stockholders equity Stockholder Rights Agreement On February 18, 1997, the Board of Directors of the Company redeemed the rights under the Companys former common stock rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each then outstanding share of common stock of the Company and authorized the distribution of one Right with respect to each subsequently issued share of common stock. The Rights were distributed to stockholders of record on March 21, 1997. On December 12, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company amended and restated the preferred stock rights plan governing the Rights (the Amended and Restated Rights Plan) to, among other things: (i) provide that, as a result of two-for-one splits of the Companys common stock effected in February and November 1999 (the Stock Splits), each Right shall represent the right to purchase one four-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) of the Company (which one four-thousandth gives effect to the Stock Splits); (ii) increase the exercise price of each Right to $350.00 from $56.25 (as adjusted for the Stock Splits); (iii) extend the term of the rights agreement to December 12, 2010 from March 21, 2007, and (iv) amend the definition of Outside Director.
F-21 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Rights Plan, each share of common stock outstanding has attached to it one whole Right. One Right represents the right to purchase one four-thousandth (1/4000) of a share of SeriesA Preferred Stock of the Company at $350.00. The Rights will expire on December 12, 2010.
Under certain circumstances, if an acquiring person or group acquires 10% or more of the Companys outstanding common stock, an exercisable Right will entitle its holder (other than the acquirer) to buy shares of common stock of the Company having a market value of two times the exercise price of one Right. However, in limited circumstances approved by the outside directors of the Board of Directors, a stockholder who enters into an acceptable standstill agreement may acquire up to 20% of the outstanding shares without triggering the Rights. If an acquirer acquires at least 10%, but less than 50%, of the Companys common stock, the Board of Directors may exchange each Right (other than those of the acquirer) for one share of common stock per Right. In addition, under certain circumstances, if the Company is involved in a merger or other business combination where it is not the surviving corporation, an exercisable Right will entitle its holder to buy shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a market value of two times the exercise price of one Right. The Company may redeem the Rights at $0.00025 per Right at any time prior to the public announcement that a 10% position has been acquired.
Stock repurchase program The Company has a stock repurchase program primarily to reduce the dilutive effect of its employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Stock repurchased under the program is intended to be retired. The amount the Company spends and the number of shares repurchased varies based on a variety of factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which the Company is restricted from repurchasing shares. In June 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $2.0 billion of common stock through June 30, 2004. At the time of the additional authorization, the Company had approximately $257.1 million remaining under the December 2000 stock repurchase authorization. In December 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock between January 1, 2001 and December31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, $1,842.1 million was available for stock repurchases through June 30, 2004.

7.Employee stock option, stock purchase, and defined contribution plans Employee stock option plans The Companys employee stock option plans provide for option grants designated as either nonqualified or incentive stock options. Option grants to employees generally vest over a three to five year period and expire seven years from the date of grant. Most employees are eligible to receive a grant of stock options annually with the number of shares generally determined by the employees salary grade and performance level. In addition, certain management and professional level employees typically receive a stock option grant upon commencement of employment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company issued 0.1 million, 0.2 million, and 0.1 million shares of restricted common stock, respectively.
Fair value disclosures of employee stock options The exercise price of employee stock option grants is set at the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time. Therefore, under the principles of APB No. 25, the Company does not recognize compensation expense associated with the grant of employee stock options. SFAS No. 123 requires the use of option valuation models to provide supplemental information regarding options granted after 1994.
The fair value of the options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively: 1) a risk-free interest rate of 3.6%, 4.7%, and 5.9%, 2) a dividend yield of 0%, 0%, and 0%, 3) a volatility factor of the expected market price of the Companys common stock of 50%, 50%, and 45%, and 4) an expected life of the options of 3.9 years, 3.7 years, and 3.4 years. These assumptions resulted in weighted-average fair values of $16.66, $26.74, and $25.87 per share for employee stock options granted in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options. The Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options such as extremely limited transferability and, in most cases, vesting restrictions. In addition, the assumptions used in option valuation models (see above) are highly subjective, particularly the expected stock price volatility of the underlying stock. Because changes in these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, existing valuation models do not provide a reliable, single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair values of the options are amortized over the options vesting periods. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policiesEmployee stock option and stock purchase plans for a detailed computation of pro forma net income and earnings per share.
Employee stock purchase plan The Company has an employee stock purchase plan whereby, in accordance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their salary to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of common stock on the first or last day of the offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, employees purchased 0.7 million, 0.6 million, and 1.3 million shares at prices of $41.09, $47.97, and $30.33 per share, respectively. In addition, during 2002, former Immunex employees purchased approximately 46,200 shares at a price of $39.58 under an Immunex stock purchase plan assumed by Amgen as a result of the acquisition. The Immunex stock purchase plan was terminated in October 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Company had 15.3million shares available for future issuance under this plan.
Defined contribution plans The Company has defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees in the United States and its possessions. Under these plans, the Company makes certain amounts of matching contributions for those employees who elect to contribute to the plans and makes additional contributions based upon the compensation of eligible employees regardless of whether or not the employees contribute to the plans. As a result of the Immunex acquisition, the Company assumed Immunexs defined contribution plan. Commencing on July16, 2002, the Company made certain amounts of matching contributions for those employees who elected to F-25 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) contribute to the former Immunex plan. In addition, the Company has other defined contribution plans covering certain employees of the Company and employees of its foreign affiliates. The Companys expense for its defined contribution plans totaled $55.6 million, $45.2 million, and $42.6 million for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
8.Debt Commercial paper program and line of credit The Company has a commercial paper program which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings up to an aggregate of $200 million. At December 31, 2002, commercial paper with a face amount of $100 million was outstanding.
These borrowings had maturities of less than one month and had effective interest rates averaging 1.4%. Commercial paper with a face amount of $100 million and with effective interest rates averaging 1.9% was outstanding at December 31, 2001.
The Company has an unsecured committed credit facility (the credit facility) with five participating banking institutions that includes a commitment expiring on May 28, 2003 for up to $150 million of borrowings under a revolving line of credit (the revolving line commitment). This credit facility supports the Companys commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2002, $150 million was available under the revolving line commitment for borrowing. Borrowings under the revolving line commitment bear interest at various rates which are a function of, at the Companys option, either the prime rate of a major bank, the federal funds rate, or a Eurodollar base rate. Under the terms of the credit facility, the Company is required to meet a minimum interest coverage ratio and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth. In addition, the credit facility contains limitations on investments, liens, and sale/leaseback transactions.
Medium and long-term notes The Company has established a $500 million debt shelf registration statement. In December 1997, pursuant to this registration statement, the Company issued $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 (the Notes) and established a $400 million medium-term note program. The Company may offer and issue medium-term notes from time to time with terms to be determined by market conditions.
The Company had $100 million of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001 that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 (the Century Notes). These securities may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Companys option at any time for a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal and remaining interest payments discounted at a determined rate plus, in each case, accrued interest.
The Company also had $23 million of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001 that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.2% and mature in 2003.
The terms of the debt securities require the Company to meet certain debt to tangible net asset ratios and place limitations on liens and sale/leaseback transactions and, except with respect to the Notes and the Century Notes, place limitations on subsidiary indebtedness.
Convertible notes On March 1, 2002, the Company issued $3.95 billion in aggregate face amount at maturity ($1,000 face amount per note) 30-year, zero-coupon senior convertible notes (the Convertible Notes) with a yield to maturity of 1.125%. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $2.82 billion (a $714.23 per note F-26 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) original issue price). The original issue discount of $1.13 billion (or $285.77 per note) is being accreted to interest expense over the life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs were approximately $56.5 million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the notes.
Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert each of their notes into 8.8601 shares of common stock of the Company (the conversion rate) at any time on or before the maturity date, approximately 35.0 million shares in the aggregate. The conversion price per share at issuance was $80.61. The conversion price per share as of any day will equal the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to that day, divided by the conversion rate, or $81.37 per share as of December 31, 2002. The holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes on March 1, 2005, March 1, 2007, March 1, 2012, and March1, 2017 at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to the purchase dates. The Company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock.
The Company may redeem all or a portion of the Convertible Notes for cash at any time on or after March1, 2007 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount as of the redemption date. In addition, the Company will pay contingent cash interest during any six-month period commencing on or after March 2, 2007 if the average market price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the original issuance price and accrued original issue discount for such note. The contingent cash interest in respect of any quarterly period will equal the greater of 1) the amount of regular cash dividends paid by the Company per share multiplied by the number of shares of common stock deliverable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes at the then applicable conversion rate or 2) 0.0625% of the average market price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six-month period provided, that if the Company does not pay cash dividends during a semiannual period it will pay contingent interest semiannually at a rate of 0.125% of the average market price of a note for a five trading day measurement period.
The aggregate stated maturities of all long-term obligations and commercial paper due subsequent to December 31, 2002, are as follows (in millions): Maturitydate Amount 2003 $ 123.0 2004  2005(1) 2,917.8 2006  2007 100.0 After 2007 100.0 $ 3,240.8 (1) Holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March 1, 2005 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (accreted value) through the purchase date.

The fair values for commercial paper, medium term notes, and long-term notes were estimated based on quoted market rates for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities.
The carrying amounts of derivative instruments approximated their fair values. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair values of derivative instruments were not material.
11.Kinetix acquisition On December 14, 2000, Amgen acquired all of the outstanding shares of Kinetix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Kinetix), a privately held company, in a tax-free exchange for 2.6 million shares of Amgen common stock. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the operating results of Kinetix are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements starting from December15, 2000. The acquisition was valued at $172.2 million, including $1.0 million of related acquisition costs and $6.5 million of Amgen restricted common stock issued in exchange for Kinetix restricted common stock held by employees retained from Kinetix. The $6.5 million is being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the restricted common stock.
F-29 Table of Contents AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The purchase price was allocated among identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Kinetix based upon their estimated fair values. A discounted, risk-adjusted cash flow analysis was performed to value the technology platform of Kinetix expected to generate future molecules that may be developed into human therapeutics, as well as in-process research projects. The analysis resulted in valuing the acquired base technology at $36.6 million, which was capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15 year period. Additionally, $30.1 million of value was assigned to acquired IPR&D, and was expensed on the acquisition date in accordance with GAAP. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired of $103.3 million was allocated to goodwill, which was amortized through December31, 2001 using a 15 year useful life. Goodwill amortization ceased beginning January 1, 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142.
12.Acquisition of certain rights from Roche In May 2002, the Company acquired certain rights related to the commercialization of NEUPOGEN  and GRANULOKINE  (Filgrastim) and pegfilgrastim in the European Union (EU), Switzerland, and Norway from Roche. Amgen paid $137.5 million for such rights. The purchase price of the rights was capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the rights acquired, estimated to be 15 years. Prior to this acquisition, NEUPOGEN  and GRANULOKINE  were commercialized in the EU under a co-promotion agreement between Amgen and Roche. Roche will continue as the licensee for Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim in certain countries outside the United States and the EU.
