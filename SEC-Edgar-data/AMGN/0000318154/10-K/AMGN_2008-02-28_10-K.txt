BUSINESS Overview Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, Amgen) was incorporated in 1980 and is a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. We operate in one business segment human therapeutics.
We market human therapeutic products in the areas of inflammation, nephrology, and supportive cancer care. Our principal products include Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), and Enbrel  (etanercept), which is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada. Aranesp  and EPOGEN  stimulate the production of red blood cells to treat anemia. Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  selectively stimulate the production of neutrophils, one type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections. ENBREL blocks the biologic activity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by competitively inhibiting TNF, a substance induced in response to inflammatory and immunological responses, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, our principal products represented 98%, 99%, and 99% of total product sales, respectively.
We maintain sales and marketing forces in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. We market our principal products to healthcare providers including clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals, and pharmacies. In addition, we have entered into licensing and/or co-promotion agreements to market our principal products in certain geographic areas. In the United States, we sell primarily to wholesale distributors. Outside the United States, we sell principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country. Sales of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans. Further, competition in all areas of our business is intense and is expected to increase.
We focus our research and development (R&D) efforts on novel therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness in the areas of inflammation, oncology and hematology, neuroscience and metabolic disorders. Our research takes a modality-independent approach to drug discovery, in which we choose the best possible approach to block a specific disease process before considering the type of drug (modality) that may be required to pursue that approach. We are studying molecules in the areas of proteins, monoclonal antibodies, peptibodies, and small molecules. We have research facilities in the United States as well as a small center in Germany, and have clinical development staff in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan. To enhance our internal R&D efforts, we have acquired companies, acquired and licensed certain product and technology rights and have established R&D collaborations. Our R&D efforts are significant and are expected to continue to grow significantly in support of our pipeline, especially in the number, size, duration, and complexity of our clinical trials.
Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill, and finish activities which produce Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, and other products (and product candidates) for both clinical and commercial purposes. We operate clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico. Third-party contract manufacturers produce additional supply of certain of our products. As part of our overall strategy to increase manufacturing capacity, we have announced plans to build a new process development, bulk manufacturing and fill and finish facility in Ireland, a new formulation, fill, and finish facility in Puerto Rico, and further expansion of our bulk manufacturing capacity in Puerto Rico.
2 Principal Products We market our principal products in the areas of inflammation, nephrology, and supportive cancer care. Our principal products include Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), and Enbrel  (etanercept).
Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa) Aranesp  is Amgens registered trademark for one of its novel erythropoiesis stimulating proteins, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. Red blood cells transport oxygen to all cells of the body. Without adequate amounts of erythropoietin, the red blood cell count is reduced. A deficient red blood cell count could result in anemia, a condition where insufficient oxygen is delivered to the bodys organs and tissues. Anemia can be associated with chronic renal failure, both in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. Anemia can also result from chemotherapy treatments for patients with nonmyeloid malignancies. Aranesp  relieves anemia symptoms and reduces the need for blood transfusions.
We were granted an exclusive license by Kirin-Amgen,Inc. (KA), a joint venture between Kirin Brewery Company, Limited (Kirin) and Amgen (see Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Kirin Brewery Company, Limited) to manufacture and market darbepoetin alfa in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries, and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East.
We primarily market Aranesp  in the United States and Europe. Darbepoetin alfa is also marketed under the brand name Nespo  in Italy. Aranesp  was initially launched in 2001 in the United States and Europe and is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure (both in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis) as well as for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies.
During 2005, we filed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions requesting label changes to include extended dosing frequency in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia and anemia associated with chronic renal failure.
Worldwide Aranesp  sales for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $3,273 million, $2,473 million, and $1,544 million, respectively.
EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa) EPOGEN  is Amgens registered trademark for its recombinant human erythropoietin product, a protein that stimulates red blood cell production. A reduced red blood cell count can result in anemia (see  Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa)). People with chronic renal failure suffer from anemia because they do not produce sufficient amounts of erythropoietin, which is normally produced in healthy kidneys.
We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States under a licensing agreement with KA. We have retained exclusive rights to market EPOGEN  in the United States for dialysis patients. We granted Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (which has assigned its rights under the Product License Agreement to Ortho Biotech Products, L.P., a subsidiary of Johnson& Johnson, hereafter referred to as Johnson& Johnson) a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis (see Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Johnson& Johnson). Johnson& Johnson markets recombinant human erythropoietin under the trademark PROCRIT  in the United States (see Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Product sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
3 We launched EPOGEN  in the United States in 1989 for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure for patients who are on dialysis. EPOGEN  is approved for the treatment of anemic adult and pediatric patients with chronic renal failure who are on dialysis. EPOGEN  is indicated to elevate or maintain the red blood cell level (as determined by hematocrit or hemoglobin measurements) and to decrease the need for blood transfusions in these patients.
EPOGEN  sales for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $2,455 million, $2,601 million, and $2,435 million, respectively.
Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim) Neulasta  is Amgens registered trademark for a pegylated protein that selectively stimulates production of certain white blood cells known as neutrophils and is based on the Filgrastim molecule (see  NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim)). Neutrophils defend against infection. Treatments for various diseases and diseases themselves can result in extremely low numbers of neutrophils, a condition called neutropenia. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy, one treatment option for individuals with certain types of cancers, targets cell types that grow rapidly, such as tumor cells. Normal cells that also divide rapidly, such as those in the bone marrow that become neutrophils, are also vulnerable to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in neutropenia with an increased risk of severe infection. Very often, neutropenia is the dose limiting side effect of chemotherapy and can thus be responsible for a reduction in the amount of chemotherapy that can be administered safely. Such reductions in chemotherapy dose can compromise the effectiveness of chemotherapy on the cancer it is being used to treat, with the result of a higher treatment failure rate. By addressing the dose limiting side effect of neutropenia, full doses of chemotherapy can be given, resulting in the potential for an improved treatment success rate in certain types of cancer such as early stage breast cancer and in intermediate grade non-Hodgkins Lymphomas. As mentioned above, the pegfilgrastim molecule is based on the Filgrastim molecule. A polyethylene glycol molecule or PEG is added to enlarge the Filgrastim molecule, thereby extending its half-life and causing it to be removed more slowly from the body. Because pegfilgrastim works by binding to its receptor on the neutrophils and its precursors, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until neutrophil recovery has occurred. This neutrophil-mediated clearance allows for administration as a single dose per chemotherapy cycle, compared with NEUPOGEN  , which requires more frequent dosing. Neulasta  is prescribed more frequently in the curative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered with the intent to cure cancer, rather than in the palliative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered to treat other complications of cancer by managing tumor growth.
We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market pegfilgrastim in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand under a licensing agreement with KA.
We primarily market Neulasta  in the United States and Europe. Pegfilgrastim is marketed under the brand name Neupopeg in Italy. Neulasta  was initially launched in the United States and Europe in 2002 and is indicated for reducing the incidence of infection associated with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies.
In September2005, the FDA approved an update to the Neulasta  prescribing information to include data from a landmark phase 3 study demonstrating that Neulasta  helps protect patients with breast cancer undergoing moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy from infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia. Administration of Neulasta  in all cycles of chemotherapy is now approved for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy associated with at least a 17% risk of febrile neutropenia.
Worldwide Neulasta  sales for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $2,288 million, $1,740 million and $1,255 million, respectively.
4 NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) NEUPOGEN  is Amgens registered trademark for its recombinant-methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a protein that selectively stimulates production of certain white blood cells known as neutrophils (see  Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)) for additional information on neutrophils). Similar to Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  is prescribed more frequently in the curative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered with the intent to cure cancer, rather than in the palliative setting, in which myelosuppressive chemotherapy is administered to treat other complications of cancer by managing tumor growth.
We were granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand under a licensing agreement with KA.
We market NEUPOGEN  primarily in the United States and Europe. Filgrastim is marketed under the brand name GRANULOKINE  in Italy. NEUPOGEN  was initially launched in the United States and Europe in 1991. NEUPOGEN  is indicated for the following: to reduce the incidence of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy; to reduce the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related consequences for patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation; to reduce the incidence and duration of neutropenia-related consequences in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, or idiopathic neutropenia (collectively, severe chronic neutropenia); for use in mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) for stem cell transplantation; and to reduce the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment in adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Worldwide NEUPOGEN  sales for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $1,216 million, $1,175 million, and $1,267 million, respectively.
Enbrel  (etanercept) ENBREL is Amgens registered trademark for its TNF receptor fusion protein that inhibits the binding of TNF to TNF receptors, which can result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity. TNF is one of the chemical messengers that help regulate the inflammatory process. When the body produces too much TNF, it overwhelms the immune systems ability to control inflammation of the joints or of psoriasis-affected skin areas. ENBREL is similar to a protein that the body produces naturally, and like this protein, it binds and deactivates certain TNF molecules before they can trigger inflammation.
We acquired the rights to ENBREL in July2002 as part of our acquisition of Immunex Corporation (Immunex).
We market ENBREL under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada (see Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Wyeth). The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Wyeth. ENBREL was initially launched in November1998 by Immunex. In June2005, the FDA approved an expanded indication for ENBREL as the first and only treatment to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis. In addition, the FDA approved an update to the ENBREL label to include new radiographic data demonstrating that ENBREL continued to inhibit the progression of joint destruction for two years among most psoriatic arthritis patients who received ongoing therapy. In addition to the approvals received in 2005, ENBREL is indicated for reducing the signs and symptoms, improving physical function, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and inducing a Major Clinical Response (a Major Clinical Response represents a high level of disease control) in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis; for the treatment of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy; for 5 reducing the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying medicines; for reducing the signs and symptoms of active arthritis and inhibiting the progression of structural damage in patients with psoriatic arthritis; and to treat the signs and symptoms in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. ENBREL is approved in a 50 mg/ml pre-filled syringe as the recommended dosing form for treatment in all approved adult indications. The pre-filled syringe eliminates the need to mix drug prior to injecting and allows most patients receiving ENBREL to take only one injection per week, instead of two 25 mg injections previously used weekly by patients.
ENBREL sales for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $2,573 million, $1,900 million, and $1,300 million, respectively.
Other Other marketed products are principally comprised of Sensipar  (cinacalcet HCl). Sensipar  is Amgens registered trademark for its first small molecule medicine used in treating chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis who produce too much parathyroid hormone, a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. Sensipar  was initially launched in 2004 and is indicated for CKD patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism as well as for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Cinacalcet HCl is marketed in Europe as Mimpara  .
Sensipar  sales for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 were $157 million and $37 million, respectively.
Marketing and Distribution We maintain sales and marketing forces in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. We market our principal products to healthcare providers including clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals, and pharmacies. We also market certain products directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer print and television advertising. In addition, for certain of our products, we promote programs to increase public awareness of the health risks associated with the diseases these products treat, as well as providing support to various patient education and support programs in the related therapeutic areas.
6 In the United States, we sell primarily to wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products. With the exception of ENBREL, we utilize these wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals, and pharmacies. For ENBREL wholesaler orders, we primarily drop-ship directly to pharmacies. Outside the United States, Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and NEUPOGEN  are principally distributed to hospitals and wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the financial condition of our larger distributors and limit our credit exposure by setting appropriate credit limits, requiring collateral and obtaining credit insurance, where appropriate. We had net product sales to three large wholesaler distributors each accounting for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. On a combined basis, these distributors accounted for 74% and 94% of total revenues and U.S. product sales, respectively, for 2005, as noted in the following table (in millions).
2005 2004 2003 AmerisourceBergen   Corporation Net product sales $ 4,760 $ 3,406 $ 2,686 % of total revenues 38 % 32 % 32 % % of U.S. product   sales 48 % 41 % 40 % Cardinal   Health,Inc.

Johnson& Johnson markets recombinant human erythropoietin under the trademark PROCRIT  in the United States (see Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Product sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth, Amgen and Wyeth market ENBREL in the United States and Canada for all approved indications other than for use in oncology. The rights to detail and promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada for use in oncology are reserved to Amgen (see Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Wyeth). Additionally, we have entered into licensing agreements to market certain of our products including Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and NEUPOGEN  in certain geographic areas outside of the United States.
Reimbursement In the United States, dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN  by the federal government through the End Stage Renal Disease Program (ESRD Program) of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement rate is established by federal law and is monitored and implemented by the Centers for Medicare& Medicaid Services (CMS). Most patients receiving Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and NEUPOGEN  for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer health care programs. Beginning in 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar  are eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare PartD. Therefore, sales of all of our principal products are 7 dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans. Generally, worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers on health care providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce health care expenditures.
The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (or the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA)) was enacted into law in December2003 and became effective January1, 2005. Changes resulting from the MMA, which lowered reimbursement for our products, could negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products. However in 2005, we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMSs oncology demonstration project (the 2005 Demonstration Project) on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp  . Furthermore, we believe this was also, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2005 Demonstration Project, which provided financial incentives to physicians for collecting and reporting oncology patient survey data, expired on December31, 2005. In November2005, CMS announced a new demonstration project (the 2006 Demonstration Project) that uses different criteria for how patients with cancer are evaluated and treated and that is targeted at approximately half of the funding originally targeted for the 2005 Demonstration Project. The final rulefor the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Ruleissued in November2005 reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average. However, recently passed legislation will eliminate this reduction for 2006. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2006.
The main components of the MMA that affect our currently marketed products are as follows:  Through 2004, the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) mechanism was the basis of Medicare PartB payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologics. Effective January1, 2005, in the physician clinic setting, Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  are being reimbursed under a Medicare PartB payment methodology that reimburses each product at 106% of its average sales price (ASP) (sometimes referred to as ASP+6%). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A products ASP is calculated on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the Current Period) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. For example, the ASP for Aranesp  that we submit for the second quarter of 2006 will be based on certain historical sales and sales incentive data for Aranesp  from January1, 2005 through December31, 2005. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect. The 2005 reimbursement rates for Aranesp  and Neulasta  (calculated at 106% of the ASPs) were lower than their respective 2004 reimbursement rates. Although the ASPs for Aranesp  and Neulasta  have trended downward during 2005, they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005.
Per the MMA, physicians in the physician clinic setting will have the choice between purchasing and billing for drugs under the ASP+6% system or obtaining drugs from vendors selected by CMS under the competitive acquisition program (CAP) starting in 2006. Physicians who select to obtain drugs from CAP will no longer purchase or obtain reimbursement directly for such drugs. CMS issued a final rulerelated to CAP in November2005. Based on this final rule, the election period for 2006 will occur between April3 and May15, 2006 for participation from July1 through December31, 2006; the first drug deliveries through the CAP will occur in July2006. Based on the final rulefor CAP, we do not anticipate widespread adoption of this program initially. Nevertheless, because we cannot fully predict how many physicians will select to obtain drugs from CAP, we 8 cannot predict the full impact of the CAP on our business. However, pursuant to the final rule, discounts to CAP vendors are excluded from the calculation of ASPs and therefore do not have the potential to impact the ASPs for our products that would be available through the CAP.
Medicares hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), which determines payment rates for specified covered outpatient drugs and biologics in the hospital outpatient setting, utilized AWP as the basis for reimbursement in 2005. CMS 2005 reimbursement rate, as in 2003 and 2004, continued the application of an equitable adjustment such that the 2005 Aranesp  reimbursement rate was based on the AWP of PROCRIT  . For 2005, the reimbursement rate for Aranesp  was 83% of the AWP for PROCRIT  , down from 88% of the AWP for PROCRIT  in 2004, with a dose conversion ratio of 330 U PROCRIT  to 1 mcg Aranesp  , the same ratio as 2004. Effective January1, 2006, the OPPS system changed from an AWP based reimbursement system to a system based on ASP. This change affects Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  when administered in the hospital outpatient setting. In November2005, CMS released its final OPPS rulefor 2006. This final rulebases reimbursement for non-pass through products such as Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  on an ASP+6% using the same payment amounts as used in the physician clinic setting and does not apply an equitable adjustment to tie the reimbursement rate for Aranesp  to PROCRIT  using a dose conversion ratio. In the final rule, CMS noted that it reserves the right to apply equitable adjustment to the Aranesp  reimbursement rate calculation methodology in years after 2006.
Pursuant to final rulesissued by CMS on November3, 2004, Medicare reimbursement for EPOGEN  used in the dialysis setting for calendar year 2005 changed from the previous rate in 2004 of $10 per 1,000 Units to $9.76 per 1,000 Units, in 2005, a rate based upon an average acquisition cost for 2003 determined by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and adjusted for price inflation based on the Producer Price Index for pharmaceutical products. Pursuant to the CMS final rules, the difference between the 2004 reimbursement rates for all drugs separately billed outside the dialysis composite rate (including EPOGEN  ) and the 2005 reimbursement rates for such drugs was added to the composite rate that dialysis providers receive for dialysis treatment. In November2005, CMS released the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule. In the final rule, CMS stated that EPOGEN  and separately billed ESRD drugs will be reimbursable at ASP+6% in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers. This final ruleestablishes the payment mechanism for separately reimbursed dialysis drugs in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers, including EPOGEN  and Aranesp  , at ASP+6% using the same payment amounts used in the physician clinic setting and calculated quarterly in the same manner as described above for our products under the Medicare PartB payment methodology. Based on this final rule, we expect that the reimbursement rate for EPOGEN  will decrease for 2006 compared to 2005. Because we cannot accurately predict the extent to which this reduced reimbursement will impact how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer EPOGEN  , we cannot estimate the full impact of the reduced reimbursement rate on our EPOGEN  product sales. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant in 2006.
Beginning January1, 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar  are eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare PartD, the MMA-mandated Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit. With the exception of a PartD demonstration project that CMS conducted in 2004-2005 that provided, among other things, reimbursement for ENBREL and Sensipar  for certain Medicare beneficiary participants, Medicare did not cover prescriptions for ENBREL and Sensipar  in 2005.
In addition, on November9, 2005, CMS released a final revision to the Hematocrit Measurement Audit Program Memorandum (HMA-PM), a Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to 9 audit EPOGEN  and Aranesp  (when used in dialysis) utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The new policy, Claims Monitoring Policy: Erythropoietin/darbepoetin alfa usage for beneficiaries with end stage renal disease (Claims Monitoring Policy), will be effective April1, 2006. The final Claims Monitoring Policy provides that if a patients hemoglobin is greater than 13 grams per deciliter, providers are instructed to reduce the patients EPOGEN  and Aranesp  dose by twenty-five percent. If the provider does not reduce the patients EPOGEN  and Aranesp  dose and there is no medical documentation to support the higher dosage, reimbursement will be reduced to the level it would have been had the provider reduced dosage by twenty-five percent. Based on our preliminary evaluation, we do not expect the new Claims Monitoring Policy to have a negative impact on EPOGEN  and Aranesp  sales and given the importance of EPOGEN  and Aranesp  for maintaining the quality of care for dialysis patients, we do not expect that the new policy will substantially impact the utilization of EPOGEN  and Aranesp  . However, we are currently in the process of further evaluating the new Claims Monitoring Policy. As a result, we cannot predict the potential full impact of this final guidance on our business.
Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates Our vision is to deliver therapies that can make a meaningful difference in patients lives and therefore, we focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness. We focus our R&D efforts in the areas of inflammation, oncology and hematology, neuroscience and metabolic disorders. We take a modality-independent approach to R&D that is, we identify targets, and then choose the modality best suited to address a specific target. As such, our discovery research programs may yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as proteins, monoclonal antibodies, peptibodies or small molecules.
In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&D efforts, acquisitions of companies, licensed technologies, and establishing R&D collaborations have enhanced our strategic position within the biotechnology industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products). We plan to expand our R&D capabilities substantially, requiring significant investments over the next several years. In 2006, we are expecting a significant increase in the number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials, in particular with respect to denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis, and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 30-40%. For example, testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials, substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. We expect to start eleven mega-site trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization, implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, China, India and some South American countries. We plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third-party contract clinical trial providers. (See Item 1A. Risk FactorsBefore we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.) We have major research facilities in the United States as well as a smaller research center in Germany, and clinical development staff in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan (see Item 2. Properties).
10 R&D expenses for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $2,314 million, $2,028 million, and $1,655 million, respectively. In 2004, we recorded $554 million for the write-off of acquired IPR&D resulting from the Tularik Inc. (Tularik) acquisition (see Note 7, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

**** Includes hematology.
Preclinical studies collect data to show that a molecule is reasonably safe for use in initial small-scale clinical trials.
Phase 1 clinical trials investigate safety and proper dose ranges of a product candidate in a small number of human subjects.
Phase 2 clinical trials investigate side effect profiles and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.
Phase 3 clinical trials investigate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.
The following represents additional information about certain of our product candidates that are in phase 2 or later human clinical trials.
Denosumab (Program formerly identified as AMG 162) Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a key mediator of the resorptive phase of bone remodeling. Denosumab is being studied across a range of conditions, including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, rheumatoid arthritis, bone metastases, and multiple myeloma.
Amgen announced interim data from a phase 2 clinical study reporting the clinical effects of denosumab on bone mineral density endpoints in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women. Based on this interim data, phase 3 clinical studies with denosumab were initiated in 2004.
Denosumab is also being studied in metastatic bone disease for the treatment of bone metastases to prevent skeletal related events (SREs). Phase 2 clinical studies of denosumab in metastatic bone disease were initiated in 2004 and completed enrollment in 2005.
Panitumumab Co-developed with Abgenix,Inc. (see Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix,Inc.), panitumumab (rHuMAb-EGFr) targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr). The EGFr pathway is important in normal and tumor cell growth. Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against EGFr and is being evaluated for the treatment of various types of cancer (solid tumor). In phase 2 clinical studies to date, panitumumab has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in advanced, refractory colorectal cancer (CRC). In a phase 3 pivotal study examining panitumumab as third-line monotherapy in CRC patients, patients who received panitumumab every two weeks showed a 46 percent decrease in tumor progression rate versus those who received best supportive care alone. Amgen initiated submission of the U.S. biologics license application under CMA pilot program I in December2005.
12 A non-registrational phase 3b study was initiated in 2005 to evaluate panitumumab plus Avastin in first-line CRC (PACCE). Registrational studies in first-line, and second-line CRC, as well as head and neck cancer (HNC) are planned for 2006.
Panitumumab is also being developed in combination with AMG 706 in the treatment of various solid tumors in a variety of conditions. Phase 1b combination studies in first-line CRC, first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and HNC were initiated in 2005.
AMG 706 AMG 706 is an oral, multi-kinase inhibitor with both anti-angiogenic and direct antitumor activity achieved by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and Kit. By inhibiting multiple receptors, AMG 706 potentially may provide more than one mechanism of action in various cancers. A phase 2 clinical study evaluating AMG 706 monotherapy in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has completed enrollment, and a phase 2 trial in advanced thyroid cancer is ongoing.
AMG 706 is also being developed in combination with multiple chemotherapy regimens, with and without panitumumab, in the treatment of solid tumors. Phase 1b combination studies in CRC, NSCLC, and other solid tumors are ongoing. These studies are also evaluating the tolerability and safety of twice-daily dosing of AMG 706.
AMG 531 AMG 531 is a first-in-class molecule, a protein called a peptibody. The active peptide component stimulates the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor resulting in increased platelet production. It is being investigated for the treatment of immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). ITP is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by an abnormal decrease in platelets, a condition known as thrombocytopenia. Platelets are specialized blood cells that help prevent and stop bleeding by participating in clotting. ITP is characterized by thrombocytopenia that results in bruising and bleeding that is sometimes severe. Phase 2 clinical studies have been completed. Phase 3 clinical studies were initiated in 2005.
Phase 2 studies in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are expected to begin in 2006.
AMG 108 AMG 108 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a cytokine known to play a role in the joint destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis. A phase 2 clinical study is under way to investigate the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with AMG 108.
Aranesp  Aranesp  is currently being evaluated in phase 3 studies for treatment of anemia in cancer patients not undergoing chemotherapy, a condition known as anemia of cancer.
Amgen has completed several phase 2 studies evaluating Aranesp  for treatment of anemia in patients with heart failure. A phase 3 program will be initiated in 2006 to evaluate the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure.
The Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp  Therapy (TREAT) is an approximately 4,000-patient, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial designed to determine the impact of anemia therapy with darbepoetin alfa on mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with CKD and type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes.
13 Kepivance (palifermin) Kepivance is currently being evaluated in localized radiation and chemotherapy settings to determine its safety and anti-mucositis activity in patients with HNC cancer (phase 3), NSCLC and colon cancer (phase 2).
Sensipar  Sensipar  is approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD on dialysis. Currently, a clinical trial is being planned to assess the effects of cinacalcet HCl on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD undergoing maintenance dialysis. Additionally, cinacalcet HCl is being evaluated in studies for use in secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic renal insufficiency (stage 3& 4 CKD) and for use in primary hyperparathyroidism.
Competition Competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and other companies that research, develop, manufacture, or market biologics and pharmaceuticals is intense and is expected to increase. We compete with these entities in all areas of our business including competing to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical, and operational personnel. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.) Our products competitive position among other biologic and pharmaceutical products may be based on, among other things, patent position, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, patient convenience/delivery devices and price. We remain committed to vigorously defending our intellectual property and growing our businesses as well as holding or increasing share. For example, the anemia area represents a significant and growing business opportunity. As such, we expect to face increasingly intense competition in this area, including new and existing technologies and competitive pressures associated with follow-on biologics, or biosimilar products as they are known in Europe and Australia (see further discussion below). We are committed to growing our anemia business, which includes impacting outcomes and supporting the development of new standards of care, exploring new technologies in anemia therapy, preparing to compete with biosimilar products in Europe, and defending our intellectual property.
Certain of our products are expected to face competition in certain geographic areas from biosimilar products. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market biosimilar products to compete with our products in the European Union (EU), presenting additional competition to our products. While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson& Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp  in the EU, which competes with Johnson& Johnsons EPREX  product, Roches Neorecormon  product, and others erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, based on an announcement by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc (Shire), we expect that the first competing Epoetin alfa product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007. Also, we expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp  , Neulasta  or NEUPOGEN  sales in the EU. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales materially. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar 14 products. In July2005, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMEA) issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what the final EMEA product specific guidelines will be.
Certain of our products face substantial competition from products marketed by large pharmaceutical companies, which may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, the introduction of new products or the development of new processes by competitors or new information about existing products may result in product replacements or price reductions, even for products protected by patents.
Some of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas where we are also performing research and developing product candidates. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent upon the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance contributing to the products eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical testing, receive regulatory approval, and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market is expected to be important to our competitive position.
In addition, we compete with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies when entering into collaborative arrangements with companies primarily in the biotechnology industry, research organizations and other entities for the research, development and commercialization of technologies, product candidates and marketed products. Other public and privately owned companies, research organizations, academic institutions and governmental agencies conduct a significant amount of R&D in the biotechnology industry. We may face competition in our collaborative arrangements or licensing and acquisition activities from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from these entities. Accordingly, we may have difficulty entering into collaborative arrangements and licensing or acquiring technologies, product candidates and marketed products on acceptable terms.
The following provides additional information on competition related to our principal products and selected product candidates in the therapeutic area(s)in which we market or expect to market them.
Nephrology Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with CKD could negatively impact product sales for Aranesp  and EPOGEN  . In the United States, Aranesp  and EPOGEN  compete with each other, primarily in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics.
Additionally, Aranesp  competes internationally with other companies marketed products to treat anemia associated with CKD. The following table reflects other companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Aranesp  internationally in the nephrology setting.

15 Roche is developing a pegylated erythropoietin product for the treatment of anemia in the United States that is the same as the product presently marketed and sold in the EU (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al.). Transkaryotic Therapies (TKT) is also developing a gene-activated erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings  Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis litigation). In addition, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd./FibroGen are co-developing an erythropoietic small molecule and Affymax,Inc. (Affymax) is developing an erythropoietin mimetic for the treatment of anemia. The first competing Epoetin alpha product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007.
Supportive cancer care Any products or technologies that are directly or indirectly successful in addressing anemia associated with chemotherapy could negatively impact product sales for Aranesp  . In the United States, Aranesp  directly competes with other currently marketed products which treat anemia associated with chemotherapy. Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  could face competition in some circumstances from companies marketing or developing treatments for neutropenia associated with chemotherapy, for bone marrow and PBPC transplant patients, and AML.
Neulasta  also competes with NEUPOGEN  in the United States and Europe. United States NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta  . However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States has occurred. In Europe, we plan to continue to actively convert NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  , emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN  . However, we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  in Europe.
The following table reflects companies and their currently marketed products that primarily compete with Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and NEUPOGEN  in the United States and internationally in the supportive cancer care setting.

In addition, a number of companies have cytokine inhibitors in development including GlaxoSmithKline plc (GlaxoSmithKline), Pfizer, Repligen Corporation, and Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
Product candidates We are currently developing product candidates, including denosumab, panitumumab, and others, which, if approved, we expect will enter into highly competitive markets. These product candidates will face substantial competition from products currently marketed as well as those under development by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The bone loss setting, in which denosumab would compete, is currently comprised of three therapeutic classes: bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and anabolic agents. The oncology setting, in which panitumumab would compete, is currently comprised of several therapeutic classes, including, but not limited to, cytotoxic agents, and VEGF and EGFr inhibitors. Competitive intensity will increase in the bone loss and oncology settings with the expected approval of new agents.
The following table reflects other companies and their currently marketed products that will primarily compete with denosumab and panitumumab, if approved: Amgen Product Candidate Competitor Marketed Product Potential Competitor Denosumab Fosamax  Merck&   Co.,Inc.
Denosumab Boniva  Roche   /GlaxoSmithKline Panitumumab Erbitux  Imclone Systems   Incorporated/Bristol Myers Squibb /Merck KGaA 17 Manufacturing and Raw Materials Manufacturing Our manufacturing operations consist of bulk manufacturing, and formulation, fill, and finish activities which produce Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  , ENBREL, and other products and product candidates for both clinical and commercial purposes. We operate clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities in several locations throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico (see Item 2. Properties).
Bulk Commercial Manufacturing Our bulk commercial manufacturing facilities are located in Longmont, Colorado, which produce Epoetin alfa and Aranesp  ; West Greenwich, Rhode Island, where we produce a substantial portion of our annual ENBREL supply; Thousand Oaks, California where we produce Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  ; and Juncos, Puerto Rico where, starting in September2005, we began manufacturing Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . In September2005, a second manufacturing facility in Rhode Island received FDA approval for the production of ENBREL.
Commercial quantities of ENBREL produced at Rhode Island are insufficient to fill the current level of demand for this product. We and Wyeth also have a contract manufacturing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (BI Pharma) for the production of additional supply of ENBREL. We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply, inventory, and allocation of supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide supply of ENBREL produced by Amgens Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharmas manufacturing facility in Germany, and Wyeths manufacturing facility in Ireland.
Our supply of ENBREL is significantly dependent on product manufactured by BI Pharma, and, accordingly, we have made significant purchase commitments to BI Pharma (see Note 8, Commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the supply agreement, BI Pharma has reserved a specified level of production capacity for ENBREL, and our supply under these purchase commitments for ENBREL is manufactured from that reserved production capacity. We are required to submit a rolling three-year forecast for manufacturing the bulk drug for ENBREL, and a rolling forecast for a shorter period for the number of finished vials of ENBREL. We have submitted firm orders for the maximum production capacity that BI Pharma currently has reserved for ENBREL. We will be responsible for substantial payments to BI Pharma if we fail to use a specified percentage of the production capacity that BI Pharma has reserved for ENBREL each calendar year or if the BI Pharma supply agreement is terminated prematurely under specified conditions.
In addition to producing our own commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, we also supply Epoetin alfa in the United States to Johnson& Johnson under a supply agreement (see Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Johnson& Johnson).
Formulation, Fill, and Finish Our operations in Puerto Rico, perform all of the formulation, fill, and finish activities for our commercial supply of Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and some of our supply of ENBREL. In addition to the formulation, fill, and finish for ENBREL performed in Puerto Rico, BI Pharma also performs these activities for the ENBREL they manufacture and supply to us under the above-noted contract manufacturing agreement. Additionally, a certain portion of the formulation, fill, and finish activities for ENBREL is performed by a third-party contract manufacturer other than BI Pharma.
To keep up with the growing demand for our products, we are operating the Puerto Rico formulation, fill, and finish facility at nearly full production capacity. In addition to the above-noted manufacturing 18 activities, our operations in Puerto Rico perform key manufacturing support functions including quality control, process development, procurement and production scheduling. Our global supply of our principal products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these Puerto Rico facilities (see Item 1A. Risk Factors We formulate, fill, and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products).
Clinical Manufacturing Bulk manufacturing of our products and product candidates for use in clinical trials is performed at our facilities in California, Colorado, Rhode Island, and Washington, by certain collaboration partners, and by third-party manufacturers. We perform formulation, fill, and finish activities for products and product candidates used in clinical applications at our facilities in California and Puerto Rico. We also utilize contract manufacturers for these activities.
Manufacturing Initiatives We actively manage our inventory supply produced by our manufacturing facilities and the supply produced by our third-party contract manufacturers. Our manufacturing capacity and third-party contract manufacturing agreements have increased and are expected to continue to increase to supply the growth in our commercial products and to support our expanding R&D activities (see Item 1A. Risk Factors We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted).
To mitigate the risks associated with our rapid growth and the concentration of manufacturing activity in Puerto Rico, we have several ongoing and new planned initiatives in place. With respect to these risks and meeting our objective to supply every patient every time with our medicines, we are in the process of increasing the number of third-party contract manufacturers and building additional manufacturing capacity. The most significant of our efforts to increase capacity and to reduce concentration is our recently announced project to construct a process development, bulk manufacturing, and formulation, fill, and finish facility in Ireland. Construction of the facility in Ireland is expected to begin in 2006.
Other capacity expansion projects that are already in process or are expected to begin in 2006 include the construction of an additional formulation, fill, and finish facility in Puerto Rico and upgrades to the existing formulation, fill, and finish operations, and the further expansion of our bulk manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico to begin to produce Epoetin alfa and Aranesp  and to increase production of Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  .
Raw Materials Certain raw materials, medical devices, and components necessary for our commercial manufacturing of our products are proprietary products of other companies, and in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA such that they must be obtained from that specific, sole source. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such sole-sourced raw materials by active inventory management, relationship management, and alternate source development, when feasible (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products). We monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs and the market conditions for these raw materials. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum, and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating screening procedures with respect to certain biological sources and alternatives to them. Raw materials, medical de 19 vices, and components may be subject to contamination and/or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products.
Joint Ventures and Business Relationships From time to time, we may enter into joint ventures and other business relationships to provide additional development, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we have acquired certain product and technology rights and have established R&D collaborations to enhance our R&D capabilities and internally developed product pipeline. Our R&D collaborations generally can consist of non-refundable, upfront license fees, R&D and commercial performance milestones, cost sharing, royalties and/or profit sharing. Additionally, these collaborations may include manufacturing and co-promotion arrangements. Our collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success.
Kirin Brewery Company, Limited We formed KA, a 50-50 joint venture with Kirin in 1984. KA develops and commercializes certain of our and Kirins technologies, which have been transferred to this joint venture. KA has given exclusive licenses to us to manufacture and market: 1) darbepoetin alfa in the United States, all European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, all Central and South American countries, and certain countries in Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, 2) recombinant human erythropoietin in the United States, and 3) pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We currently market certain of these products under the brand names EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim).
KA has also given exclusive licenses to Kirin to manufacture and market: 1) darbepoetin alfa in Japan, the Peoples Republic of China (China), Taiwan, Korea, and certain other countries in Southeast Asia, 2) recombinant human erythropoietin in Japan, and 3) G-CSF and pegfilgrastim in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Kirin markets recombinant human erythropoietin and G-CSF in China under a separate agreement with KA. Kirin markets its recombinant human erythropoietin product in Japan under the trademark ESPO  . Kirin markets its G-CSF product in its respective territories under the trademark GRAN  .
KA has licensed to Johnson& Johnson rights to recombinant human erythropoietin in certain geographic areas of the world (see  Johnson& Johnson). Under its agreement with KA, Johnson& Johnson pays a royalty to KA based on sales. KA has also licensed to Roche rights to pegfilgrastim and G-CSF in certain geographic areas of the world.
During 2005 certain of our and Kirins technologies related to AMG 531 were transferred to KA. In return, KA has given us and Kirin exclusive licenses to manufacture and market AMG 531 in certain territories. KA is currently conducting phase 3 studies related to AMG 531.
In connection with our various license agreements with KA, we pay KA royalties based on product sales and also receive payment for conducting certain R&D activities on behalf of KA (See Note 2, Related party transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Johnson& Johnson We granted Johnson& Johnson a license to commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic in the United States in all markets other than dialysis. In the United States, all recombinant human erythropoietin sold by Johnson& Johnson is manufactured by us and sold by Johnson& Johnson under the trademark PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa). PROCRIT  brand Epoetin alfa is identical to EPOGEN  brand Epoetin alfa, which is manufactured and sold by us in the U.S. dialysis market. Pursuant to the license agreement with Johnson& Johnson, we earn a 10% royalty on sales of PROCRIT  by Johnson& Johnson in the United States.
20 Outside the United States, with the exception of China and Japan, Johnson& Johnson was granted rights to manufacture and commercialize recombinant human erythropoietin as a human therapeutic for all uses under a licensing agreement with KA. With respect to its sales outside of the United States, Johnson& Johnson manufactures and commercializes its own brand of Epoetin alfa which is then sold throughout the world by Johnson& Johnson under various trademarks such as EPREX  and ERYPO  . We are not involved in the manufacture of Epoetin alfa sold by Johnson& Johnson outside of the United States.
(See Item 3. Legal Proceedings Johnson& Johnson Matters Arbitration/Demand for Separate BLA.) Wyeth Amgen and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL under a co-promotion agreement in the United States and Canada for all approved indications other than for use in oncology. The rights to detail and promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada for oncology indications are reserved to Amgen. The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Wyeth. Under the co-promotion agreement, a management committee comprised of equal representation from Wyeth and Amgen is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including: strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from each party, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. Further, pursuant to the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth and Amgen each pay a defined percentage of all selling and marketing expenses approved by the management committee. In addition, we pay Wyeth a percentage of the annual gross profits of ENBREL, which reflect the sharing of manufacturing costs in the United States and Canada attributable to all approved indications for ENBREL on a scale that increases as gross profits increase; however, we maintain a majority share of ENBREL profits. Under the co-promotion agreement, Wyeth is required to reimburse Amgen for: 1) certain clinical and regulatory expenses we incur in connection with the filing and approval of any new indications for ENBREL in the United States and Canada, excluding oncology and rheumatoid arthritis indications; 2) certain specified patent expenses related to ENBREL; and 3) certain costs, expenses, and liabilities associated with the manufacture, use, or sale of ENBREL in the United States and Canada.
We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply, inventory, and allocation of supplies of ENBREL. Under this agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide supply of ENBREL produced by Amgens Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharmas manufacturing facility in Germany, and Wyeths manufacturing facility in Ireland.
Abgenix,Inc.
In October2003, Amgen and Abgenix,Inc. (Abgenix) amended an existing agreement to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody created by Abgenix (see Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates). Abgenix is a company specializing in the discovery, development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies. Under the amended agreement, we have decision-making authority for the joint development and commercialization of panitumumab, but development and commercialization costs, as well as any potential profits from future sales of panitumumab, are shared equally. We have the right to conduct all future clinical trials. In addition, Abgenix will manufacture clinical and early commercial supplies of panitumumab with our support and assistance. If clinical trials for panitumumab are successful and regulatory approval is received, we would have the primary role in implementing marketing and product launch activities for panitumumab, while Abgenix may participate in co-promotion.
21 In December2005, we signed a definitive merger agreement under which we will pay shareholders of Abgenix $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.2 billion and will assume Abgenixs outstanding debt. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger on January19, 2006 and we expect to close the merger, subject to Abgenix shareholder approval, by April2006. If and when the merger is closed, the terms of the above-noted business relationship will terminate.
Government Regulation Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities.
In order to clinically test, manufacture, and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. In the United States, the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated there under, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products on a product-by-product basis. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves our expenditure of substantial resources and, after approval, such approval remains costly for us to maintain. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an investigational new drug application with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program. In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to determine the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates. In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of our product candidates. In phase3, we conduct clinical trials to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid proof of safety and efficacy. The time and expense required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. For example, our late-stage product candidate denosumab requires large trials that require substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. Historically, our products have required smaller, shorter trials. We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. Even after we have obtained initial FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness and are required to gain clearance for the use of a product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the products use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us.
In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories, and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If after receiving clearance from the FDA, we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories, and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories, or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.
In the European countries, Canada, and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. Additionally, depending on the type of drug for which 22 approval is sought, there are currently two potential tracks for marketing approval in the European countries: mutual recognition and the centralized procedure. These review mechanisms may ultimately lead to approval in all EU countries, but each method grants all participating countries some decision-making authority in product approval.
We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. The federal government has published regulations that identify safe harbors or exemptions for certain arrangements that do not violate the anti-kickback statutes. We seek to comply with the safe harbors where possible. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on us, including our stock price. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities.
Since 1991, we have participated in the Medicaid rebate program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and under amendments of that law that became effective in 1993. Participation in this program has included extending comparable discounts under the Public Health Service (PHS) pharmaceutical pricing program. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we pay a rebate for each unit of our product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as a minimum 15.1% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) of that product, or if it is greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any customer. The rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP increases faster than inflation. The PHS pricing program extends discounts comparable to the Medicaid rebate to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of poor Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our reports of our current AMP and best price for each of our products to the CMS. The terms of our participation in the program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates (and interest, if any), if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information.
We also make our products available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. Since 1993, as a result of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the VHC Act), federal law has required that product prices for purchases by the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) be discounted by a minimum of 24% off the AMP to non-federal customers (the non-federal average manufacturer price, non-FAMP). Our computation and report of non-FAMP is used in establishing the price, and the accuracy of the reported non-FAMP may be audited by the government under applicable federal procurement laws. Among the remedies available to the government for infractions of these laws is 23 recoupment of any overages paid by FSS users during the audited years. In addition, if we were found to have knowingly reported a false non-FAMP, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per item that is incorrect.
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local laws, rules, and/or regulations. Our R&D activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state, or local laws, rules, and/or regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. Our research and manufacturing activities also are conducted in voluntary compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.
Additionally, the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws, rules, and/or regulations.
(See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.) 24 Patents and Trademarks We have filed applications for a number of patents, have been granted patents, or have obtained rights relating to our products and various potential products. Our material patents are set forth in the table below.

There can be no assurance that our patents or licensed patents will afford legal protection against competitors or provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage. In addition, our patents or licensed patents could be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or infringed or circumvented by others, or others could obtain patents that we would need to license or circumvent. Competitors or potential competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to proteins, small molecules, compounds, or processes competitive with ours. Additionally, for certain of our product candidates, competitors, or potential competitors may claim that their existing or pending patents prevent us from commercializing such product candidates in certain territories. Further, when our patents expire, other companies could develop new competitive products to our products. Our near-term European patent expirations could result in new competitive products to our products in Europe. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on or biosimilar products to compete with these products in the EU; presenting additional competition to our products. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.) While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to 25 Johnson& Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp  in the EU, which competes with Johnson& Johnsons EPREX  product, Roches Neorecormon  product, and others erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, based on an announcement by Shire, we expect that the first competing Epoetin alfa product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007. Also, we expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp  , Neulasta  or NEUPOGEN  sales in the EU. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. In July2005, the EMEA, issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what final EMEA product specific guidelines will be.
In general, we have obtained licenses from various parties which we deem to be necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use or sale of our products. These licenses generally require us to pay royalties to the parties on product sales. In addition, other companies have filed patent applications or have been granted patents in areas of interest to us. There can be no assurance any licenses required under such patents will be available for license on acceptable terms or at all. We are engaged in various legal proceedings relating to certain of our patents (see Item3. Legal Proceedings).
Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require our staff members, material consultants, scientific advisors, and parties to collaboration and licensing agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, the consulting relationship, or the collaboration or licensing arrangement with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or obtain access to our information.
(See Item 1A. Risk Factors If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.) (See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.) Human Resources As of December31, 2005, we had approximately 16,500 staff members, which includes approximately 100 part-time staff members. Of the total staff members as of December31, 2005, approximately 6,500 were engaged in R&D, approximately 3,000 were engaged in selling and marketing, approximately 5,100 were engaged in commercial manufacturing activities, and approximately 1,900 were engaged in other activities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue attracting and retaining qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs. None of our staff members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our staff relations to be good. We expect to hire additional staff members throughout 2006, primarily in R&D to enable us to advance the pipeline.

Geographic Area Financial Information For financial information concerning the geographic areas in which we operate, see Note 9, Segment information Geographic information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investor Information Financial and other information about us is available on our website ( http://www.amgen.com ) (This website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained in our website is not intended to be a part of this filing). We make available on our website, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a)or 15(d)of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC.
Item 1A. RISK FACTORS This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our managements assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely.
28 If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.
The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. To date, there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies patents. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates, and technologies. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For example, F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) is developing a pegylated erythropoietin molecule that, according to Roches public statements, they expect to bring to the U.S. market despite their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents. On November8, 2005, we filed a lawsuit against Roche for patent infringement of six of our U.S. patents. This lawsuit is described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Amgen Inc. v. F.Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., et al. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly, and can preclude or delay commercialization of products. We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in patent litigation. For example, we are currently involved in an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Transkaryotic Therapies,Inc. (TKT) and Aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents. If we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be: subject to competition and/or significant liabilities; required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology; or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin, natural and recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, etanercept, and our other products and potential products. We market our erythropoietin, recombinant G-CSF, darbepoetin alfa, pegfilgrastim, and etanercept products as EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), and Enbrel  (etanercept), respectively. With respect to our material patents, we have had a number of G-CSF patent expiries in the United States and one erythropoietin patent expiry in the European Union (EU). For additional information on our material patents see Patents and Trademarks in Item 1. Business.
We also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in Europe relating to: erythropoietin; G-CSF; pegfilgrastim (pegylated G-CSF); etanercept; two relating to darbepoetin alfa; and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market follow-on or biosimilar products to compete with these products in the EU; presenting additional competition to our products. (See  Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.) While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson& Johnson (through Kirin Amgen,Inc. (KA)), we do market Aranesp  in the EU, which competes with Johnson& Johnsons EPREX  product, Roches Neorecormon  product, and others erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, based on an announcement by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc (Shire), we expect that the first competing Epoetin alfa product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in the first half of 2007. Also, we expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G- 29 CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp  , Neulasta  or NEUPOGEN  sales in the EU. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. In July2005, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMEA), issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what final EMEA product specific guidelines will be.
Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.
Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials which demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans for the indications sought. The results of these clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain regulatory approval from government authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical trials are experiments conducted using our product candidates in human patients having the diseases or medical conditions we are trying to address. Conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims we are seeking. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate, and therefore, we may spend as much as several years completing certain trials. Further, the time within which we can complete our clinical trials depends in large part on the rate of patient enrollment. Patient enrollment is a function of several factors, including the size of the patient population, enrollment criteria, the proximity of the patients to the trial sites, and competition with other clinical trials for eligible patients. As such, there may be limited availability of patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. Delays in planned patient enrollment can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals and associated delays in product candidates reaching the market. Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the course of our clinical trials that may delay or prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates. Of course, even if we successfully manage our clinical trials, we may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval on this basis.
In 2006, we are expecting a significant increase in the number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials, in particular with respect to denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis, and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 30-40%. For example, testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials, substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. We expect to start eleven mega-site trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization, implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, China, India and some South American countries. We plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third-party contract clinical trial providers.
30 If we fail to adequately manage the increasing number, size and complexity of our clinical trials, our clinical trials and corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates altogether. If we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or are unable to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected materially.
Our product development efforts may not result in commercial products.
We intend to continue an aggressive research and development program. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results  the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness  the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize  other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all  the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics  we and certain of our licensors or partners may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process, including, but not limited to, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (MGDF), and Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF). For example, in 1997, we announced the failure of BDNF for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrigs Disease, because the product candidate, when administered by injection, did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase 3 trial, even though BDNF had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials. In addition, in 1998, we discontinued development of MGDF, a novel platelet growth factor, at the phase 3 trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies. Also, in June2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of GDNF for the treatment of advanced Parkinsons disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of the double-blind treatment phase of the study even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator initiated open label study over a three year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinsons disease patients. Subsequently, in the fall of 2004 we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease after several patients in the phase 2 study developed neutralizing antibodies and new preclinical data showed that GDNF caused irreversible damage to the area of the brain critical to movement control and coordination. On February11, 2005, we confirmed our previous decision to halt clinical trials and, as a part of that decision and based on thorough scientific review, we also concluded that we will not provide GDNF to the 48 patients who participated in clinical trials that were terminated in thefall of 2004. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product. Wecannot guarantee we will be able to produce or manufacture commercially successful products. (See  Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our 31 product sales.,  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations. and  Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.) Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.
In the United States, dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN  by the federal government through the End Stage Renal Disease Program (ESRD Program) of Medicare. The ESRD Program reimburses approved providers for 80% of allowed dialysis costs; the remainder is paid by other sources, including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance, and to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. The ESRD Program reimbursement rate is established by federal law and is monitored and implemented by the Centers for Medicare& Medicaid Services (CMS). Most patients receiving Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and NEUPOGEN  for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer health care programs. Beginning in 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar  are eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare PartD. Therefore, sales of all of our principal products are dependent, in part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans. Generally, worldwide use of our products may be affected by cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers on health care providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce health care expenditures.
The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (or the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA)) was enacted into law in December2003 and became effective January1, 2005. Changes resulting from the MMA, which lowered reimbursement for our products, could negatively affect product sales of some of our marketed products. However in 2005, we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMSs oncology demonstration project (the 2005 Demonstration Project) on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp  . Furthermore, we believe this was also, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2005 Demonstration Project, which provided financial incentives to physicians for collecting and reporting oncology patient survey data, expired on December31, 2005. In November2005, CMS announced a new demonstration project (the 2006 Demonstration Project) that uses different criteria for how patients with cancer are evaluated and treated and that is targeted at approximately half of the funding originally targeted for the 2005 Demonstration Project. The final rulefor the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Ruleissued in November2005 reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average. However, recently passed legislation will eliminate this reduction for 2006. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2006.
The main components of the MMA that affect our currently marketed products are as follows:  Through 2004, the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) mechanism was the basis of Medicare PartB payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologics. Effective January1, 2005, in the physician clinic setting, Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  are being reimbursed under a Medicare PartB payment methodology that reimburses each product at 106% of its average sales price (ASP) (sometimes referred to as ASP+6%). ASP is calculated by the manufacturer based on a statutorily defined formula and submitted to CMS. A products ASP is calculated on a quarterly basis and therefore may change each quarter. The ASP in effect for a given quarter (the Current 32 Period) is based upon certain historical sales and sales incentive data covering a statutorily defined period of time preceding the Current Period. For example, the ASP for Aranesp  that we submit for the second quarter of 2006 will be based on certain historical sales and sales incentive data for Aranesp  from January1, 2005 through December31, 2005. CMS publishes the ASPs for products in advance of the quarter in which they go into effect. The 2005 reimbursement rates for Aranesp  and Neulasta  (calculated at 106% of the ASPs) were lower than their respective 2004 reimbursement rates. Although the ASPs for Aranesp  and Neulasta  have trended downward during 2005, they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005.
Per the MMA, physicians in the physician clinic setting will have the choice between purchasing and billing for drugs under the ASP+6% system or obtaining drugs from vendors selected by CMS under the competitive acquisition program (CAP) starting in 2006. Physicians who select to obtain drugs from CAP will no longer purchase or obtain reimbursement directly for such drugs. CMS issued a final rulerelated to CAP in November2005. Based on this final rule, the election period for 2006 will occur between April3 and May15, 2006 for participation from July1 through December31, 2006; the first drug deliveries through the CAP will occur in July2006. Based on the final rulefor CAP, we do not anticipate widespread adoption of this program initially. Nevertheless, because we cannot fully predict how many physicians will select to obtain drugs from CAP, we cannot predict the full impact of the CAP on our business. However, pursuant to the final rule, discounts to CAP vendors are excluded from the calculation of ASPs and therefore do not have the potential to impact the ASPs for our products that would be available through the CAP.
Medicares hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS), which determines payment rates for specified covered outpatient drugs and biologics in the hospital outpatient setting, utilized AWP as the basis for reimbursement in 2005. CMS 2005 reimbursement rate, as in 2003 and 2004, continued the application of an equitable adjustment such that the 2005 Aranesp  reimbursement rate was based on the AWP of PROCRIT  . For 2005, the reimbursement rate for Aranesp  was 83% of the AWP for PROCRIT  , down from 88% of the AWP for PROCRIT  in 2004, with a dose conversion ratio of 330 U PROCRIT  to 1 mcg Aranesp  , the same ratio as 2004. Effective January1, 2006, the OPPS system changed from an AWP based reimbursement system to a system based on ASP. This change affects Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  when administered in the hospital outpatient setting. In November2005, CMS released its final OPPS rulefor 2006. This final rulebases reimbursement for non-pass through products such as Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  on an ASP+6% using the same payment amounts as used in the physician clinic setting and does not apply an equitable adjustment to tie the reimbursement rate for Aranesp  to PROCRIT  using a dose conversion ratio. In the final rule, CMS noted that it reserves the right to apply equitable adjustment to the Aranesp  reimbursement rate calculation methodology in years after 2006.
Pursuant to final rulesissued by CMS on November3, 2004, Medicare reimbursement for EPOGEN  used in the dialysis setting for calendar year 2005 changed from the previous rate in 2004 of $10 per 1,000 Units to $9.76 per 1,000 Units, in 2005, a rate based upon an average acquisition cost for 2003 determined by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and adjusted for price inflation based on the Producer Price Index for pharmaceutical products. Pursuant to the CMS final rules, the difference between the 2004 reimbursement rates for all drugs separately billed outside the dialysis composite rate (including EPOGEN  ) and the 2005 reimbursement rates for such drugs was added to the composite rate that dialysis providers receive for dialysis treatment. In November2005, CMS released the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule. In the final rule, CMS stated that EPOGEN  and separately billed ESRD drugs will be reimbursable at ASP+6% in both freestanding and hospital-based dialysis centers. This final ruleestablishes the payment mechanism for separately reimbursed dialysis drugs in both freestanding and hospital- 33 based dialysis centers, including EPOGEN  and Aranesp  , at ASP+6% using the same payment amounts used in the physician clinic setting and calculated quarterly in the same manner as described above for our products under the Medicare PartB payment methodology. Based on this final rule, we expect that the reimbursement rate for EPOGEN  will decrease for 2006 compared to 2005. Because we cannot accurately predict the extent to which this reduced reimbursement will impact how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer EPOGEN  , we cannot estimate the full impact of the reduced reimbursement rate on our EPOGEN  product sales. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant in 2006.
In addition, on November9, 2005, CMS released a final revision to the Hematocrit Measurement Audit Program Memorandum (HMA-PM), a Medicare payment review mechanism used by CMS to audit EPOGEN  and Aranesp  (when used in dialysis) utilization and appropriate hematocrit outcomes of dialysis patients. The new policy, Claims Monitoring Policy: Erythropoietin/darbepoetin alfa usage for beneficiaries with end stage renal disease (Claims Monitoring Policy), will be effective April1, 2006. The final Claims Monitoring Policy provides that if a patients hemoglobin is greater than 13 grams per deciliter, providers are instructed to reduce the patients EPOGEN  and Aranesp  dose by twenty-five percent. If the provider does not reduce the patients EPOGEN  and Aranesp  dose and there is no medical documentation to support the higher dosage, reimbursement will be reduced to the level it would have been had the provider reduced dosage by twenty-five percent. Based on our preliminary evaluation, we do not expect the new Claims Monitoring Policy to have a negative impact on EPOGEN  and Aranesp  sales and given the importance of EPOGEN  and Aranesp  for maintaining the quality of care for dialysis patients, we do not expect that the new policy will substantially impact the utilization of EPOGEN  and Aranesp  . However, we are currently in the process of further evaluating the new Claims Monitoring Policy. As a result, we cannot predict the potential full impact of this final guidance on our business.
If, and when, reimbursement rates or availability for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our current or future products, health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them, which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products. This could result in lower product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. For example, the use of EPOGEN  in the United States in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the U.S. federal government. In early 1997, CMS, formerly known as Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA), instituted a reimbursement change for EPOGEN  , which materially and adversely affected our EPOGEN  sales until the policies were revised. Also, we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in the United States, Europe, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact product sales. Further, when a new therapeutic product is approved, the governmental and/or private coverage and reimbursement for that product is uncertain. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates, including those at a late stage of development, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time. Sales of all our products are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. Reduction in reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations.
34 Certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components are single-sourced from third parties; third-party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products.
Certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Also, certain medical devices and components necessary for formulation, fill, and finish of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. Certain of these raw materials, medical devices, and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third-party suppliers and, in some cases, such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the FDA so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the FDA approved that other supplier. We would be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices, or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third-party single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or action, due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, and/or due to unexpected demand, labor shortages or disputes. We would also be unable to obtain these materials, devices and components for an indeterminate period of time if such supply was subsequently found to not be in compliance with our quality standards or resulted in quality failures or product contamination and/or recall when used to manufacture, formulate, fill, or finish our products. These events could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. For example, we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill, and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility without impact on our ability to supply these products. However, we may experience the shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products.
Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin, or HSA. We are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources as such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. Also, some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. A material shortage, contamination, recall, and/or restriction of the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially.
Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.
We and certain of our licensors and partners conduct research, preclinical testing, and clinical trials for our product candidates. In addition, we manufacture and contract manufacture and certain of our licensors and partners manufacture our product candidates. We also manufacture and contract manufacture, price, sell, distribute, and market or co-market our products for their approved indications. These activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, such as the FDA and CMS, as well as in foreign countries, including European countries, Canada, Australia and Japan. Currently, we are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries regulatory authorities before we can manufacture (or have our third-party manufacturers produce), market and sell our products in those countries. In our experience, obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years, and after it is obtained, remains costly to maintain. (See  Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected.) 35 The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to terminate clinical trials, require additional testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval, require changes in labeling of our products, and mandate product withdrawals. Substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the United States and most are approved in Europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses. However, later discovery of unknown problems with our products could result in restrictions on the sale or use of such products, including potential withdrawal of the product from the market. If new medical data suggests an unacceptable safety risk or previously unidentified side-effects, we may voluntarily withdraw, or regulatory authorities may mandate the withdrawal of, such product from the market for some period or permanently. Further, regulatory agencies could change existing, or promulgate new, regulations at any time which may affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our existing or future products or require significant additional costs to obtain or maintain such approvals. We currently manufacture and market all our approved principal products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. (See  Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. and  We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.) Even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products, these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, ENBREL is manufactured both by us at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities and by third-party contract manufacturers, including Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (BI Pharma). Formulation, fill, and finish of bulk product produced at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities is performed by us and third-party service providers and formulation, fill, and finish of bulk product manufactured at our other facilities that is currently solely performed by us may also be performed by us and third-party service providers in the future. The third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers are also subject to FDA regulatory authority. (See  Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) In addition, later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers could result in restrictions on the sale, manufacture, or use of such products, including potential withdrawal of the products from the market. For example, we have conducted a voluntary wholesaler recall of a limited number of lots of ENBREL as a result of a small number of reports of missing, detached or loose rubber caps on the needle-less syringe filled with diluent liquid by a third-party contract manufacturer and packaged with the vials of ENBREL. Although there have been no observable adverse event trends associated with the reports of missing detached or loose rubber caps, we may experience the same or other problems in the future resulting in broader product recalls or adverse event trends. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend, or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. In addition, if regulatory authorities determine that we or our licensor or partner conducting research and development activities on our behalf have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.
We formulate, fill, and finish substantially all our products at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at this facility, we may not be able to supply these products.
We currently perform all of the formulation, fill, and finish for EPOGEN  , Aranesp  , Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  and some formulation, fill, and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. Our global supply of these products is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of this facility. Additionally, to keep up with the growing demand for 36 our products, we are operating this facility at nearly full production capacity. Power failures, the breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, or failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA, contamination or shortages of components used in the formulation, fill, and finish of our products, among others, could adversely affect our formulation, fill, and finish operations. For example, this facility in Puerto Rico has experienced manufacturing component shortages and has had evidence of adverse trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that has reduced the production output. Although these experiences in Puerto Rico have not impacted our ability to supply product in the past, the same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate for lost sales and could result in such losses adversely affecting our product sales and operating results materially.
Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.
We currently manufacture and market all our principal products, and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products. Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. (See  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.) Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products is impacted by many manufacturing variables, such as availability of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier, facility capacity, the timing and actual number of production runs, production success rates, bulk drug yields, and the timing and outcome of product quality testing. If we have problems in one or more of these or other manufacturing variables, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, in the second quarter of 2002, the prior co-marketers with respect to ENBREL experienced a brief period where no ENBREL was available to fill patient prescriptions, primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from BI Pharma, our primary third-party manufacturer of ENBREL. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients, physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, and sales of our products will be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations.
We are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our bulk supply and the formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL.
We currently produce a substantial portion of annual ENBREL supply at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities. However, we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our ENBREL bulk supply as well as for some of the formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL that we manufacture. BI Pharma is our third-party manufacturer of ENBREL bulk drug; accordingly, our U.S. and Canadian supply of ENBREL is currently significantly dependent on BI Pharmas production schedule for ENBREL. We would be unable to produce ENBREL in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in BI Pharmas scheduled production if BI Pharma or other third-party manufacturers used for the formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to labor shortages or disputes, regulatory requirements or action, or contamination of product lots or product recalls. This in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for ENBREL, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Among the factors that could affect our actual supply of ENBREL at any time in 37 clude, without limitation, is BI Pharmas and the Rhode Island facilities bulk drug production scheduling. For example, BI Pharma does not produce ENBREL continuously; rather, it produces the bulk drug substance through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year. Our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities are currently dedicated to ENBREL production. The amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors, including the timing and actual number of BI Pharmas production runs, the actual number of runs at our Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, and, for either the Rhode Island or BI Pharma facilities, the level of production yields and success rates, the timing and outcome of product quality testing, and the amount of formulation, fill, and finish capacity.
We are dependent on third parties for some formulation, fill, and finish of ENBREL bulk drug substance manufactured at our Rhode Island facilities. If third-party formulation, fill, and finish manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or are otherwise unable to provide services to us, then supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially.
Under a collaboration and global supply agreement, we and Wyeth share the total worldwide supply of ENBREL produced by Amgens Rhode Island manufacturing facilities, BI Pharmas manufacturing facility in Germany and Wyeths manufacturing facility in Ireland. Our ENBREL supply forecasts rely on certain assumptions of how much ENBREL each of these manufacturing facilities is expected to produce. If any of these manufacturing facilities are unable to produce in accordance with our or Wyeths expectations, the worldwide supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected materially. In such cases, we may be required to allocate supply for Wyeths benefit. To the extent that there is a shortfall in worldwide production expectations, our supply of ENBREL could be adversely affected.
We have grown rapidly, and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted.
We have had an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot completely control. For example:  we need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control  we need to attract and retain highly qualified management, scientific, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, including hiring of approximately 1,000 new staff into our research and development organizations in 2006  we will need to assimilate new staff members and we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger, faster growing and geographically diverse organization  we will need to significantly expand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials  we will need to significantly expand our sales and marketing resources to launch a number of late-stage product candidates close in time  we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity for both commercial and clinical supply  we will need to start up and operate a number of new manufacturing facilities and enter into and manage new third-party contract manufacturing arrangements, which may result in temporary inefficiencies and higher cost of goods  we are implementing an enterprise resource planning system to support our increasingly complex business and business processes and such implementation carries substantial operations risk, including loss of data or information, unanticipated increases in costs, disruption of operations or business interruption 38 Of course, there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks. If we fail to manage our growth in these ways or others, such failure could result in a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.
Our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. For example, ENBREL competes in certain circumstances with products marketed by Centocor,Inc., Johnson& Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, Biogen IDEC Inc., Genentech,Inc., Pfizer Inc., Novartis Corp., and Sanofi-Aventis, as well as the generic drug methotrexate, and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed. Additionally, Aranesp  competes with products marketed by Johnson& Johnson in the United States and the EU and with products marketed by Roche in the EU. Also, Aranesp  may face competition in the EU from another Epoetin alfa product produced by Shire in the first half of 2007. Aranesp  and EPOGEN  may also face competition from Roches pegylated erythropoietin molecule that, according to Roches public statements, they expect to bring to the U.S. market despite their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents. (See  If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected.) Further, if our currently marketed products are approved for new uses, or if we sell new products, we may face new, additional competition that we do not face today. Our principal European patent relating to erythropoietin expired on December12, 2004 and our principal European patent relating to G-CSF expires on August22, 2006. We believe that after the expiration of each of these patents, other companies could receive approval for and market biosimilar products to compete with our products in the EU, presenting additional competition to our products. While we do not market erythropoietin in Europe as this right belongs to Johnson& Johnson (through KA), we do market Aranesp  in the EU, which competes with Johnson& Johnsons EPREX  product, Roches Neorecormon  product and others erythropoietin products. We cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU. However, we believe that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the EU beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp  , Neulasta  or NEUPOGEN  sales in the EU. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with our products. Our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales materially. The EU is currently in the process of developing regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. In July2005, the EMEA issued clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products including erythropoietins and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, which guidance recommends that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct fairly extensive pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical safety studies and a pharmacovigilance program. In October2005, the EMEA confirmed that biosimilar products will be approved under a different legal pathway than the one applicable to generics of small molecule drugs. Based on the process and timing outlined by the EMEA, we believe relevant product specific guidelines are likely to be finalized by the first quarter of 2006. However, we cannot predict what the final EMEA product specific guidelines will be.
Certain of our competitors, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products, and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label.
39 Large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop, and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. Business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors.
Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of freestanding dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins.
A significant portion of our product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health,Inc., and McKesson Corporation. Sales to these three customers aggregated approximately 94% of total U.S. product sales in 2005. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of these products, EPOGEN  , is primarily sold to independent freestanding dialysis clinics, which have recently experienced significant consolidation. Three of these freestanding dialysis clinics, DaVita Inc., Fresenius Medical Care North America,Inc., and Renal Care Group,Inc., account for approximately 70% of all EPOGEN  sales in the freestanding dialysis clinic setting. This concentration and consolidation has increased these entities purchasing leverage and may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins. The results of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our product sales and results of operations.
Our marketing of ENBREL will be dependent in part upon Wyeth.
Under a co-promotion agreement, we and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada. A management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and Wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of ENBREL including strategic planning, the approval of an annual marketing plan, product pricing, and the establishment of a brand team. The brand team, with equal representation from us and Wyeth, prepares and implements the annual marketing plan, which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party, and is responsible for all sales activities. If Wyeth fails to market ENBREL effectively or if we and Wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our sales of ENBREL may be adversely affected materially.
Our business may be impacted by government investigations or litigation.
We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters, government investigations, our business operations, government requests for information, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and are updated as required in subsequently filed Form10-Qs. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affects how we operate our business. Consequently, it is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (in the case of monetary damages, in the period in which such damages are incurred).
The federal government, state governments and private payers are investigating, and many have filed actions against, numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Amgen and Immunex Corporation, now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated AWP, which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and other payers to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. A number of these actions have been brought against us and/or Immunex. Additionally, a number of states have pending in 40 vestigations regarding our Medicaid drug pricing practices and the U.S. Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services have requested that Immunex produce documents relating to pricing issues. Further, certain state government entity plaintiffs in some of these AWP cases are also alleging that companies, including ours, are not reporting their best price to the states under the Medicaid program. These cases and investigations are described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings Average Wholesale Price Litigation, and are updated as required in subsequent Form10-Qs. Other states and agencies could initiate investigations of our pricing practices. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions and/or investigations could result in substantial economic damages and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such liabilities are incurred.
We may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims.
Product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert managements attention, and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain company products.
We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.
If we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products, and changes to or re-approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required, any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.
After any of our products are approved for commercial use, we or regulatory bodies could decide, and have in the past decided, that changes to our product labeling are required. Label changes may be necessary for a number of reasons, including: the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns by regulatory agencies; the discovery of significant problems with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products or subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label. Any significant concerns raised about the safety or efficacy of our products could also result in the need to reformulate those products, to conduct additional clinical trials, to make changes to our manufacturing processes, or to seek re-approval of our manufacturing facilities. Significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of a product could ultimately lead to the revocation of its marketing approval. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised. The revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations.) Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.
Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. However, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of related therapies. Organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products. For example, we understand that the Agency for Healthcare Re 41 search and Quality (AHRQ) is currently preparing a report on erythropoietic stimulating proteins used in cancer treatment. To the extent that the report makes recommendations on the use of Aranesp  , use of this product could be affected. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.
Our stock price is volatile, which could adversely affect your investment.
Our stock price, like that of other biotechnology companies, is volatile. For example, in the fifty-two weeks prior to December31, 2005, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $86.17 per share to a low of $57.20 per share. Our stock price may be affected by a number of factors, such as:  changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices  adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products  actual or anticipated clinical trial results  actual or anticipated product supply constraints  product development or other business announcements by us or our competitors  regulatory matters or actions  announcements in the scientific and research community  intellectual property and legal matters  broader economic, industry and market trends unrelated to our performance  failure to complete the Abgenix,Inc. (Abgenix) acquisition In addition, if our revenues, earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment communitys expectations, there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price.
Our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations.
The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing, and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain regulatory approval and comply with manufacturing regulations. and  Difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing may limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. and  We may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market.) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe to be current best practices, we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations and/or laws a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, or other sanctions or litigation.
42 Our revenues may fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations.
Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses for the foreseeable future, we assume that revenues will continue to grow; however, some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term. Because of this, even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a periods results to be below our expectations or projections. A revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors, some of which we cannot control. For example, we may face:  changes in the governments or private payers reimbursement policies for our products  inability to maintain regulatory approval of marketed products or manufacturing facilities  changes in our product pricing strategies  lower than expected demand for our products  inability to provide adequate supply of our products  changes in wholesaler buying patterns  increased competition from new or existing products  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Of course, there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period. Similarly if investors or the investment community are uncertain about our financial performance for a given period, our stock price could also be adversely impacted.
We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with Abgenix,Inc.
On December14, 2005, we announced that we had signed a definitive merger agreement under which we would acquire Abgenix for approximately $2.2 billion in cash plus the assumption of debt. The acquisition will provide us with full ownership of panitumumab and eliminate a tiered royalty on denosumab, two of our most important advanced pipeline products, as well as provide us with Abgenixs manufacturing plant. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities from integrating the businesses. In particular, this will require the successful regulatory approval and commercial launch of panitumumab along with production of panitumumab at Abgenixs manufacturing plant. The integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate Abgenixs operations, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities that we expect to result from the merger, or we may not achieve the expected benefits within the anticipated time frame. Further, the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the two companies. We cannot assure you that the integration of Abgenix with us will result in the realization of the full post-merger benefits anticipated by us. Our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.
Continual manufacturing process improvement efforts may result in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired.
In connection with our ongoing process improvement activities associated with products we manufacture, we continually invest in our various manufacturing practices and related processes with the objective of increasing production yields and success rates to gain increased cost efficiencies and capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these efforts and our other estimates and assumptions regarding future product sales, the carrying value of certain manufacturing facilities or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value at the time that such effects are identified. The potential recognition of impairment in the carrying value, if any, could have a material and adverse affect on our results of operations.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
Item 2.
PROPERTIES The following discussion summarizes our significant properties as of December31, 2005. For additional information regarding planned additions to our facilities, see Item 1. Business Manufacturing and Raw Materials.
Our principal executive offices, a majority of our administrative offices, and a significant portion of our R&D facilities are located in forty-five buildings in Thousand Oaks, California. Thirty-eight of the buildings located in Thousand Oaks are owned and seven are leased.
Adjacent to these buildings are facilities that are under construction and additional land for future expansion. The Thousand Oaks, California, properties include manufacturing facilities licensed by various regulatory bodies to produce commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim). Clinical manufacturing of certain of our product candidates is also performed in Thousand Oaks.
We own six buildings in Longmont, Colorado, including a manufacturing complex that is licensed to produce commercial quantities of Epoetin alfa and Aranesp  bulk drug substance. We have undeveloped land adjacent to the Longmont site to accommodate future expansion. We also own two buildings and lease seven buildings in Boulder, Colorado, housing process development research and manufacturing facilities. We also perform clinical manufacturing of Aranesp  in Colorado.
We own ten buildings and lease space in five buildings in the Seattle, Washington area, which house research, clinical manufacturing, and administrative facilities. In January2004, we opened the Seattle research center. We also own additional land for future expansion in the Seattle, Washington area.
We own five buildings in West Greenwich, Rhode Island, including two manufacturing facilities which produce commercial and clinical quantities of Enbrel  (etanercept), and lease a warehouse facility in Cranston, Rhode Island.
As part of the Tularik acquisition, we assumed leases on eight buildings in South San Francisco, California, which house R&D and administrative facilities. In connection with the acquisition, we initiated an integration plan to consolidate certain Tularik leased facilities, and currently only occupy two of the eight buildings. Additionally, we assumed leases on land for future development in the South San Francisco, California area.
Elsewhere in North America, we own a distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky, and a research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We lease facilities for administrative offices in Washington, D.C.; San Diego, Sacramento, and Camarillo, California; and Canada, and lease four facilities for regional sales and marketing offices in the United States.
Outside North America, we own twelve buildings in Juncos, Puerto Rico, including both bulk and formulation, fill, and finish manufacturing facilities and warehouse facilities. Our facilities in Juncos, Puerto Rico, are responsible for formulation, fill, and finish activities related to our production of Epoetin alfa, Aranesp  , Neulasta  , NEUPOGEN  and ENBREL. In September2005, we received FDA approval of a new bulk drug production plant in Puerto Rico which is used for the production of Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  . We are also in process of constructing an additional bulk manufacturing plant in Juncos which will be used for the production of Epoetin alfa and Aranesp  . In addition, we own additional property on the Puerto Rico Site for future expansion. We also own a European packaging and distribution center in Breda, The Netherlands. We lease facilities in nineteen European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, for administration, sales and marketing, and/or development.
We believe that our existing facilities, third party contract manufacturing agreements, and our anticipated additions are sufficient to meet our expected needs.
44 Item 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Certain of our legal proceedings are discussed below. While it is impossible to predict accurately or to determine the eventual outcome of these matters, we do not believe any such proceedings currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of the proceedings could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.
Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis Litigation On April15, 1997, Amgen filed suit in the Massachusetts District Court against TKT and Hoechst Marion Roussel,Inc. (HMR now Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc., together with TKT, the Defendants) alleging infringement of three U.S.patents owned by Amgen that claim an erythropoietin product and processes for making erythropoietin. Amgen sought an injunction preventing the Defendants from making, importing, using, or selling erythropoietin in the United States. On October7, 1999, Amgen filed an amended complaint, which added two additional patents to the litigation. Defendants amended answer asserted that all five of the patents-in-suit were not infringed, were invalid, or were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
Amgens motion for summary judgment of literal infringement was granted by the Massachusetts District Court on April26, 2000 with respect to claim 1 of U.S.Patent No.5,955,422 (the 422 Patent). On May15, 2000, trial began in the Massachusetts District Court. On June9, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Defendants motion for non-infringement of U.S.Patent No.5,618,698 (the 698 Patent), removing the 698 Patent from this action. On July21, 2000, the Massachusetts District Court granted Amgens motion for judgment on the Defendants defenses of invalidity based upon anticipation and obviousness.
On January19, 2001, the Massachusetts District Court ruled that claims 2-4 of U.S.Patent No.5,621,080 (the 080 Patent), claims1, 3,4, and 6 of U.S.Patent No.5,756,349 (the 349 Patent) and claim 1 of the 422 Patent were valid, enforceable, and infringed by TKTs erythropoietin product and the cells used to make such product. The Massachusetts District Court also held that claim 7 of the 349 patent and claims1, 2, and 9 of U.S.Patent No.5,547,933 (the 933 Patent) were not infringed, and that if infringed the claims of the 933 patent would be invalid.
On January26, 2001, the Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal and on February14, 2001, Amgen filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal, to the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On March22, 2001, Amgen filed an Amended Notice of Cross-Appeal to include claim 9 of the 698 patent. After the parties briefed the issues on appeal, oral arguments were heard on May7, 2002 by the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
On January6, 2003, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Courts decision that the Defendants infringe the 349 and 422 patents and held that claims 1 and 2 of the 933 patent were invalid. The court further upheld the enforceability and validity of all of the asserted claims except for validity over two references which was vacated and remanded to the District Court. The court vacated and remanded to the District Court of Massachusetts for further consideration of (i)the finding of infringement of the 080 patent, (ii)the holding of non-infringement of the 698 patent, and (iii)the effect of two references on the validity of the asserted claims of the patents. On January20, 2003, the Defendants filed a Combined Motion for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Federal Circuit regarding the courts affirmance of the validity of the asserted claims under 35U.S.C. 112. On March3, 2003, the Federal Circuit denied the Defendants Motions for Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc. The Massachusetts District Court held a trial on the remanded issues on October7-8 and 15-17 and November3-6, 2003. On October30, 2003, the Massachusetts District Court ruled that claims 2-4 of the 080 patent are infringed.
45 On October15, 2004, the Massachusetts District Court decided the remaining issues remanded from the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Amgens favor. In the October15 decision, the court ruled that claims 4-9 of the 698 patent are valid and infringed, claims 2-4 of the 080 claims are valid, claim 1 of the 422 is valid and claim 7 of the 349 patent is valid and infringed. On December10, 2004, TKT filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. After the parties briefed the issues, on December6, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard oral argument on the appeal filed by TKT.
Israel Bio-Engineering Project Litigation On September3, 2002, Israel Bio-Engineering Project (IBEP), filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Amgens wholly-owned subsidiary, Immunex Corporation (Immunex), Wyeth and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the U.S.District Court for the Central District of California, relating to a U.S.Patent No.5,981,701 (the 701 Patent). Although not the title owner of record, IBEP alleges that it owns the 701 Patent. IBEP asserts that the manufacture and sale of Enbrel  (etanercept)infringes claim 1 of this patent. IBEP seeks an accounting of damages and of any royalties or license fees paid to a third-party and seeks to have the damages trebled on account of alleged willful infringement. IBEP also seeks to force the defendants to take a compulsory non-exclusive license. On September4, 2003, Yeda Research and Development Co. Ltd. (Yeda), the title owner of record of the 701 patent, joined as an interventor-defendant. On February18, 2004, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Yeda on the issue of ownership.
On March31, 2004, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants including Amgen and Immunex. IBEP filed a Notice of Appeal. Oral argument was heard by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on January11, 2005.
On March15, 2005, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Courts findings that IBEP did not gain title to the U.S. Patent No.5,981,701 under its contract interpretation theory. However, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the issue whether IBEP gained title under its employment theory.
On December22, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted Intervenor Yedas motion for summary judgment that the plaintiff, IBEP, lacks standing to sue Amgen, Immunex and Wyeth for patent infringement. On January26, 2006, IBEP filed a Notice of Appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Average Wholesale Price Litigation Amgen and Immunex are named as defendants, either separately or together, in numerous civil actions broadly alleging that they, together with many other pharmaceutical manufacturers, reported prices for certain products in a manner that allegedly inflated reimbursement under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs, and commercial insurance plans, including co-payments paid to providers who prescribe and administer the products. The complaints generally assert varying claims under the federal RICO statutes, their state law corollaries, as well as state law claims for deceptive trade practices, common law fraud, and various related state law claims. The complaints seek an undetermined amount of damages, as well as other relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief.
The AWP litigation was commenced against Amgen and Immunex on December19, 2001 with the filing of Citizens for Consumer Justice etal.v. Abbott Laboratories,Inc., etal. Additional cases have been filed since that time. Most of these actions, as discussed below, have been consolidated, or are in the process of being consolidated, in a federal Multi-District Litigation proceeding (the MDL Proceeding), captioned In Re: Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation MDL No.1456 and pending in the U.S.District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the Massachusetts District Court).
46 These cases that are, or are in the process of being consolidated into the MDL Proceeding, are being brought by consumer classes and certain state and local governmental entities. The cases consist of the following:  Citizens for Consumer Justice, etal.,v. Abbott Laboratories,Inc., et al.; Teamsters Health& Welfare Fund of Philadelphia, etal.,v.

In the MDL Proceeding, the Massachusetts District Court has set various deadlines relating to motions to dismiss the complaints, discovery, class certification, summary judgment and other pre-trial issues. For the class action cases, the Court has divided the defendant companies into a PhaseI group and a PhaseII group. The class certification hearing for the PhaseI group was held on February10, 2004. On January30, 2006, the Massachusetts District Court certified three classes (one nationwide class and two Massachusetts-only classes) with respect to the Phase I group. Both Amgen and Immunex are in the Phase II group. On March2, 2006, plaintiffs filed a fourth amended master consolidated complaint, which did not include their motion for class certification as to the Phase II companies.
Certain AWP cases are not a part of the MDL Proceeding. These cases are:  Robert J. Swanstonv. TAP Pharmaceutical Products,Inc., etal.
This Arizona state class action was filed against Amgen and Immunex on December20, 2002 in the Maricopa County, Arizona Superior Court. The Court has set a hearing on plaintiffs motion to certify a statewide class for May13, 2005; however, the Court stayed the entire case on March10, 2005. A status conference was held on December12, 2005 in which the Court extended the stay until May 2006.

Immunex Governmental Investigations According to press reports, many pharmaceutical companies are under investigation by the U.S.Department of Justice, the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services, and/or state agencies related to the pricing of their products. Immunex has received notices from the U.S.Department of Justice requesting it to produce documents in connection with a Civil False Claims Act investigation of the pricing of Immunexs current and former products for sale and eventual reimbursement by Medicare or state Medicaid programs. Immunex also received similar requests to procure documents from the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services and state agencies. Several of Immunexs current and former products are or were regularly sold at substantial discounts from list price. The Company does not know what action, if any, the federal government or any state agency may take as a result of their investigations.
State Attorney General Investigations Amgen and/or Immunex have been advised by the Attorneys General for 14 states of pending investigations regarding drug pricing practices pertaining to the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) and Best Price calculations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Act, as those terms are defined in 42U.S.C. 1396r-8. These states have requested that Amgen and Immunex preserve records relating to AMP and best price calculations. Immunex has also been advised that the Attorney General for the State of Idaho is investigating claims relating to AWP as to numerous companies, including Immunex. The Company does not know what actions, if any, may be taken as a result of these investigations.
Johnson& Johnson Matters Arbitration/Demand for Separate BLA On November11, 2003, Ortho Biotech Products, L.P., Ortho Biotech Inc., and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical (wholly owned subsidiaries of Johnson& Johnson, collectively, Ortho) filed a demand for arbitration against the Company before the American Arbitration Association in Chicago, Illinois.

(Ortho Biotech) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Amgen alleging violations of Sections1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections1 and 2. The complaint seeks a preliminary injunction enjoining Amgen from offering discounts to oncology clinics on its G-CSF products (NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) and Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)) and Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), if customers purchase certain amounts of both 49 types of products. Ortho Biotech also seeks a permanent injunction against such discounts, as well as damages it has allegedly sustained by virtue of Amgens contracting program. The court has ordered completion of discovery on Ortho Biotechs preliminary injunction motion by April10, 2006, and an additional period for briefing, before deciding whether an evidentiary hearing on that motion will be necessary.
Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al.
On November8, 2005, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court in Boston, Massachusetts against F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Roche Diagnostics GmbH, and Hoffmann-La Roche,Inc. seeking a declaration by the Court that defendants importation, use, sale or offer to sell a pegylated version of recombinant human erythropoietin infringes Amgens patents. Amgen alleges infringement of six of its U.S. Patents that claim erythropoietin products (EPO), pharmaceutical compositions, and processes for making erythropoietin, specifically U.S. Patent Nos. 5,756,349; 5,621,080; 5,618,698; 5,955,422; 5,547,933; and 5,441,868. Amgen is seeking a permanent injunction preventing the defendants from making, importing, using, offering for sale or selling recombinant human EPO, including pegylated EPO, in the United States. On March9, 2006, Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol AMGN. As of February3, 2006, there were approximately 14,000 holders of record of our common stock. No cash dividends have been paid on the common stock to date, and we currently intend to utilize any earnings for development of our business and to repurchase our common stock.
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the range of high and low quarterly closing sales prices of the common stock as quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market: High Low Year ended December31,   2005 4th Quarter $ 84.42 $ 73.37 3rd Quarter 86.17 60.86 2nd Quarter 63.18 57.20 1st Quarter 64.87 57.98 Year ended December31,   2004 4th Quarter $ 64.76 $ 52.70 3rd Quarter 59.98 53.23 2nd Quarter 60.43 52.82 1st Quarter 66.23 57.83 Item 5(c).
CHANGES IN SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES During the three months ended December31, 2005, we had two outstanding stock repurchase programs. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity for the three months ended December31, 2005 is as follows: TotalNumber ofShares Maximum$Value TotalNumber Average PurchasedasPart thatMayYetBe ofShares PricePaid ofPublicly PurchasedUnderthe Purchased perShare AnnouncedPrograms Programs(1) October1  October31 21,131 $ 76.11  $ 2,774,930,757 November1    November30 9,586,325 81.97 9,585,700 1,989,159,938 December1    December31 5,179,900 87.02 5,172,414 6,539,004,766 Total 14,787,356 (2) $ 83.73 14,758,114 (2) (1) In December2004, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in December2005, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock.
(2) The difference between total number of shares purchased and the total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs is due to repurchases of common stock from certain employees in connection with their exercise of stock options issued prior to June23, 1998 as well as shares of 51 common stock withheld by us for the payment of taxes upon vesting of certain employees restricted stock.

(1) We began recording Enbrel  sales subsequent to our acquisition of Immunex Corporation in July2002.
(2) Included in operating expenses are acquisition charges of $12 million, $53 million, $70 million, and $87 million, in 2005, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Acquisition charges consist of the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short-term retention plans, including non-cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition, non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value, and external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquisition.
(3) As part of the accounting for the Tularik Inc. and Immunex Corporation acquisitions, we recorded a charge to write-off acquired IPR&D of $554 million in 2004 and $2,992 million in 2002, respectively. The IPR&D charge represents an estimate of the fair value of the in-process research and development for projects and technologies that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
52 (4) In August2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. In July2002, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Immunex Corporation for a purchase price of approximately $17.8 billion.
(5) In March2002, we issued convertible notes with a face amount at maturity of $3.95 billion. Holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates, the earliest of which was March1, 2005, at the accreted principal amount through the purchase dates. On March2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.2 billion, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Accordingly, the convertible notes repurchased were classified as current liabilities at December31, 2004. Holders of the remaining outstanding convertible notes may require us to purchase, generally for cash, all or a portion of the notes on various dates at a price equal to the accreted principal amount through the purchase date. The next available put date was March1, 2006, however, the holders of substantially all of the then outstanding convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. The next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on March1, 2007. Accordingly, as of December31, 2005, the convertible notes have been classified as non-current liabilities.
(6) In November2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due in 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due in 2014.

Overview The following managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.
We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of inflammation, nephrology and supportive cancer care. For the year ended December31, 2005, total revenues were $12,430 million and net income was $3,674 million, or $2.93 per share on a diluted basis. As of December31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5,255 million.
For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, product sales represented 97% and 95% of total revenues, respectively. Over the last several years, our product sales growth has been primarily driven by sales of Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), Enbrel  (etanercept), and Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim), which have benefited from share gains and/or market growth. We expect these products to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term. However, we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment. (See Competition in Item 1. Business for further information on the impact of competition on our business.) Going forward, we will continue to focus on share gains, but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used. Our principal products have 54 attained significant sales levels, and for certain of our products, in a relatively short period of time. As a result, although we have experienced significant year over year sales growth as a result of share gains and/or market growth, in the near term, we expect our product sales growth to be lower than that achieved in the past several years.
Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer health care programs. (Through 2005, primary reimbursement for ENBREL was obtained from private payers but, beginning in 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar  will be eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Program PartD.) Therefore, our principal product sales and sales growth are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies. While we believe that our 2005 product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (or the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA)) that went into effect in 2005, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that went into effect on January1, 2006 could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future. However, we believe that such changes are not likely to be significant to our business in 2006. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see Reimbursement in Item 1. Business.
International product sales for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 represented 18% and 17% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales. International product sales have grown significantly over the last several years driven by Aranesp  and Neulasta  reflecting continued penetration. However, we anticipate facing greater competition in Europe from the availability of biosimilar products. We expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the European Union (EU) beginning in late 2006 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval which would compete with Aranesp  . We also expect that the first biosimilar G-CSF product may be approved as early as mid-2007 and that it would compete with Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim). We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future Aranesp  , Neulasta  or NEUPOGEN  sales in the EU. (See Competition in Item 1. Business for further information regarding biosimilar products.) In order to maintain commercial success in Europe, we plan to continue to support the development of new standards of care and continue to actively convert NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  , emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN  .
Our international product sales are impacted by foreign currency changes (see Results of Operations discussion below). International product sales growth during 2005 and 2004 benefited by $46 million and $164 million, respectively, from foreign currency exchange rate changes. During 2005, international product sales for the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes, but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter. However, both the positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated, in part, by the natural, opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated.
For 2005 and 2004, operating income increased $1,500 million and $257 million over their respective prior year periods, primarily as a result of our product sales growth. Operating income as a percentage of product sales was 40% for 2005 and 34% for 2004. Operating income for 2004 was impacted by the IPR&D charge of $554 million relating to the acquisition of Tularik during 2004 (see Note 7, Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2005, we increased our operating expenses to advance our product pipeline and support our product sales growth. During 2005, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of product sales decreased from 26% to 23% as we leveraged our prior year SG&A spending. In 2006, we expect our R&D expenses to grow 30-40%, principally as a result 55 of significant increases in our clinical development activities discussed below. To support this increased investment in our pipeline, SG&A expenses in 2006 are expected to grow at a rate comparable to the 2005 growth rate. As a result of the significant anticipated growth in R&D expenses, we expect our 2006 operating expenses to grow at a higher rate than our anticipated 2006 product sales growth.
We focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness. (See Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates in Item 1. Business for further information on our R&D vision and product pipeline.) In December2005, we signed a definitive merger agreement under which we will pay shareholders of Abgenix,Inc. (Abgenix) $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.2 billion and will assume Abgenixs outstanding debt. Abgenix is a company specializing in the discovery, development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies and is our co-development partner for panitumumab. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger on January19, 2006 and we expect to close the merger, subject to Abgenix shareholder approval, by April2006. (See Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix,Inc. in Item 1. Business for further information on the co-development agreement with Abgenix.) We have expanded and will need to continue to significantly expand our clinical development resources, including human capital, to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials. In 2006, we are expecting a significant increase in the number, size, duration and complexity of our clinical trials, in particular with respect to denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis, and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 30-40%. For example, testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials, substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute. We expect to start eleven mega-site trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization, implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, China, India and some South American countries. We plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third-party contract clinical trial providers.
There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D, increasingly intense competition for our currently marketed products and product candidates, broad reimbursement changes, complex and expanding regulatory requirements, and intellectual property protection. (See Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) In addition to these economic and industry-wide factors, we, as a company, face certain additional challenges and have a number of opportunities as well. We have established leadership positions with all of our principal products, attaining significant sales levels, and for certain of our products, in a relatively short period of time. As a result, we expect our product sales growth rates in the near term will be lower than those achieved in the past several years. We expect increasing competition internationally as the first biosimilar products may be available in Europe shortly after the anticipated approval in late 2006 and in the anemia area worldwide, as the related business opportunities are significant and growing. We believe that future sales growth for certain of our principal products should benefit from increased penetration and market growth through new areas of treatment and/or greater awareness. Further, over the last several years, our pipeline has substantially increased and with that comes the challenge of delivering on the pipeline, including executing on large and complex clinical trials. Our strategy to overcome these challenges and to be successful in taking advantage of our opportunities is straightforward. We plan to:  Focus solely on human therapeutics 56  Invest heavily in R&D and be productive  Pursue organic growth supplemented by external investments and partnerships  Secure and defend our intellectual property  Hire and retain the best people In the near term, our 2006 objectives are straightforward as well. We intend to balance short-term financial performance with significant R&D investment to drive long-term growth. We plan to grow our markets and hold or increase share. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property and plan to take steps to grow our anemia business. We will continue to proactively manage and expand our production capacity ensuring that our commercial and clinical manufacturing is reliable and not subject to a single-point failure. As always, compliance with regulations and laws is of the utmost importance to us and we intend to sustain and enhance our very good compliance record. Lastly, remaining entrepreneurial, aggressive, and patient-focused as we grow larger will enable us to fulfill these objectives and our mission to serve patients.
Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total product sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Total U.S.
$ 9,892 19 % $ 8,279 22 % $ 6,764 Total   International 2,130 25 % 1,698 54 % 1,104 Total product   sales.
$ 12,022 20 % $ 9,977 27 % $ 7,868 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, foreign exchange effects, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply, and acquisitions. (See Principal Products in Item 1. Business for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Sales growth in 2005 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp  , ENBREL, and Neulasta  , which have benefited from share gains and/or market growth. International product sales growth benefited by $46 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. During 2005, the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes, but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter.
Sales growth in 2004 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp  , ENBREL, and Neulasta  . U.S. sales for Aranesp  and Neulasta  were impacted by higher incentives earned by customers under performance-based contracts. International product sales growth benefited by $164 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes.
We expect Aranesp  , ENBREL, and Neulasta  to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term. However, we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment. Going forward, we will continue to focus on share gains, but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used.
57 In 2005, we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMSs oncology demonstration project (the 2005 Demonstration Project) on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp  . Furthermore, we believe this was also, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2005 Demonstration Project, which provided financial incentives to physicians for collecting and reporting oncology patient survey data, expired on December31, 2005. In November2005, CMS announced a new demonstration project (the 2006 Demonstration Project) that uses different criteria for how patients with cancer are evaluated and treated and that is targeted at approximately half of the funding originally targeted for the 2005 Demonstration Project. The final rulefor the 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Ruleissued in November2005 reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average. However recently passed legislation will eliminate this reduction for 2006. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business. However, we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2006. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see Reimbursement in Item 1. Business.
Aranesp  For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total Aranesp  sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Aranesp  U.S.
$ 2,104 37 % $ 1,533 56 % $ 980 Aranesp  International 1,169 24 % 940 67 % 564 Total Aranesp  $ 3,273 32 % $ 2,473 60 % $ 1,544 The increase in U.S. Aranesp  sales for the year ended December31, 2005 was primarily driven by market growth and share gains. Sales growth for 2005 was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although the ASPs for U.S. Aranesp  trended downward during 2005, we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2005, Aranesp  usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics increased, reflecting a conversion from EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa). This conversion is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. International Aranesp  sales growth for 2005 was principally driven by demand, benefiting only slightly, $20 million, from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The increase in U.S. Aranesp  sales for the year ended December31, 2004 was driven by demand, which benefited from share gains in both oncology and nephrology and market growth. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Aranesp  sales for the year ended December31, 2004 was principally driven by demand, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Aranesp  sales growth for 2004 also benefited by $92 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes.
For 2006, we believe Aranesp  sales growth will be driven primarily by market growth and greater penetration from extended dosing. However, we believe future worldwide Aranesp  sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines 58 relating to the use of our products; government programs such as the 2006 Demonstration Project; penetration of new and existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, sales of Aranesp  have been and may continue to be benefited by its use in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN  . This conversion is expected to stabilize by mid 2006.
EPOGEN  2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 (Amounts in millions) EPOGEN  U.S.
$ 2,455 (6 )% $ 2,601 7 % $ 2,435 EPOGEN  sales for the year ended December31, 2005 decreased primarily due to lower demand, unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels, and an unfavorable revised estimate of dialysis demand, primarily spillover, for prior quarters. Demand for 2005 was affected by conversion to Aranesp  in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics, which has represented approximately 10% of the EPOGEN  business, and reflects higher sales incentives. This conversion to Aranesp  is expected to stabilize by mid 2006. Demand for EPOGEN  in the freestanding dialysis clinics remains consistent with patient population growth at approximately 3% to 4%. Spillover is a result of our contractual relationship with Johnson& Johnson (see Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EPOGEN  revenue recognition and Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Product sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
For the year ended December31, 2004, the growth in reported EPOGEN  sales was primarily driven by demand, which reflects dialysis patient population growth and a continued focus in the renal community on patient outcomes, and to a lesser extent, increases in wholesaler inventory levels.
We believe EPOGEN  should experience sales growth in 2006 primarily as a result of patient population growth and the stabilization of conversion to Aranesp  in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics by mid 2006. Patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with EPOGEN  are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. Therefore, we believe EPOGEN  sales growth will further depend on changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.). We believe EPOGEN  sales growth will also be dependent, in part, on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, cost containment pressures from the federal government on health care providers and the effects of pricing.
59 Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim) sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Neulasta  U.S.
$ 1,900 29 % $ 1,476 26 % $ 1,175 NEUPOGEN  U.S.
805 3 % 778 (12 )% 881 U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  Total 2,705 20 % 2,254 10 % 2,056 Neulasta  International 388 47 % 264 230 % 80 NEUPOGEN  International 411 4 % 397 3 % 386 International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  Total 799 21 % 661 42 % 466 Total Worldwide Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  $ 3,504 20 % $ 2,915 16 % $ 2,522 The increase in U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the year ended December31, 2005 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta  , which benefited from recent guidelines recommending earlier use. U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales, Neulasta  in particular, also benefited from a label extension based on new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use in moderate risk chemotherapy regimens. In addition, U.S. sales growth was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although the ASPs for U.S. Neulasta  have trended downward during 2005, we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the year ended December31, 2005, was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta  . International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for 2005 also benefited by $18 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes.
The increase in U.S. Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the year ended December31, 2004 was primarily driven by demand for Neulasta  , which benefited from new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use. Sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. The increase in international Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales for the year ended December31, 2004 was primarily due to demand for Neulasta  , which reflects continued market penetration since the January2003 launch of Neulasta  in Europe, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales growth for 2004 benefited by $65 million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
We believe that 2006 sales growth for Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  will be primarily driven by greater first cycle use due to increased awareness of febrile neutropenia. However, future worldwide Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans) (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products.); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; government programs such as the 2006 Demonstration Project; penetration of existing markets; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including follow-on biologic products in Europe; the development of new treatments for cancer; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  , however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta  /NEUPOGEN  . NEUPOGEN  competes with Neulasta  in the United States and Europe. U.S. NEUPOGEN  sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to 60 Neulasta  . However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States has occurred. In Europe, we plan to continue actively converting NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  , emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to NEUPOGEN  . However, we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of NEUPOGEN  patients to Neulasta  in Europe.
ENBREL For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 ENBREL  U.S.
$ 2,470 35 % $ 1,827 46 % $ 1,254 ENBREL  International 103 41 % 73 59 % 46 Total ENBREL $ 2,573 35 % $ 1,900 46 % $ 1,300 ENBREL sales growth for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 was driven by demand, reflecting strong growth in both rheumatology and dermatology. ENBREL sales growth has benefited from its competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings. In dermatology, ENBREL has grown significantly since its approval for moderate to severe psoriasis in Aprilof 2004 and is the number one prescribed systemic therapy in this area.
We believe 2006 sales growth will be driven by increased penetration in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings and as a result of ENBREL being eligible for coverage from the U.S. government under Medicare Program PartD beginning in 2006. However, future ENBREL sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: the effects of competing products or therapies; penetration of existing and new markets, including potential new indications; the availability and extent of reimbursement by government and third-party payers; and governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products).
Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes selected operating expenses for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (amounts in millions): 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Product sales $ 12,022 20 % $ 9,977 27 % $ 7,868 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes   amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,082 20 % $ 1,731 29 % $ 1,341 %   of product sales 17 % 17 % 17 % Research and development $ 2,314 14 % $ 2,028 23 % $ 1,655 %   of product sales 19 % 20 % 21 % Write-off of acquired   in-process research and development  $ 554  Selling, general and   administrative $ 2,790 9 % $ 2,556 31 % $ 1,957 % of   product sales 23 % 26 % 25 % 61 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see Consolidated Statements of Operations), increased 20% for the year ended December31, 2005, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Costs of sales for 2005 was also impacted by the $47 million write-off of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2006 is expected to be comparable to 2005.
Cost of sales for the year ended December31, 2004, increased 29% primarily driven by higher sales volumes, and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs due to changes in the product mix.
Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. R&D expenses increased 14% for the year ended December31, 2005, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs, which included the full year integration of the Tularik operations and the buildup of our R&D organization to support the growth in our pipeline. The 2005 growth also reflects higher costs relating to key clinical trials and clinical manufacturing, including the continued ramp up of large-scale phase 3 trials for denosumab (formally known as AMG 162), Amgens investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2005, staff-related costs and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $171 million and $118 million, respectively. In 2006, we expect our total R&D expenses to increase 30-40% primarily due to higher staff-related costs and a significant increase in clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs. Staff-related costs are expected to increase due to a significant increase in personnel throughout 2006. Clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs are expected to increase due to several large ongoing late-stage clinical trials initiated in 2005 as well as additional planned trials for 2006. These include trials in denosumab, panitumumab, AMG 706, Aranesp  , Sensipar  , and ENBREL (see Item 1. Business Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates.) Our expected increase in R&D costs for 2006 does not include any incremental R&D costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Abgenix (see Item 1. Business Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix,Inc.) In 2004, R&D expenses increased 23% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs including the addition of R&D personnel from Tularik, and to a lesser extent, higher costs relating to clinical manufacturing and key clinical trials costs, including the commencement of large-scale phase 3 trials for AMG 162, Amgens investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2004, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately $233 million and $122 million, respectively.
Acquired in-process research and development IPR&D represents an estimate of the fair value of the various R&D projects and technologies in the acquired companys pipeline that, as of the acquisition date, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In 2004, we incurred a charge of $554 million, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Tularik acquisition (see Note 7, Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements). Assuming successful completion of the proposed acquisition of Abgenix expected to close by April2006, we would expect to incur a charge for IPR&D. However, the amount of this charge has not yet been determined.
62 Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal, and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A increased 9% for the year ended December31, 2005, primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL, which has increased due to ENBREL sales growth.
In 2005, outside marketing expenses and staff-related costs increased approximately $241 million and $42 million, respectively. During 2005, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased from 26% to 23% as we leveraged our prior year SG&A spending. In 2006, we expect higher Wyeth profit share expense due to expected ENBREL sales growth. However, total SG&A expense growth for 2006 is expected to be comparable to 2005 growth to allow greater investment in the pipeline.
In 2004, SG&A increased 31% for the year ended December31, 2004, primarily due to higher staff-related costs and higher outside marketing expenses, which reflects higher spending to support our products in competitive markets and sales growth. In 2004, staff-related costs and outside marketing expenses increased approximately $255 million and $236 million, respectively.
Other items, net In 2005, other items, net consisted of a $49 million charge, net of amounts previously accrued, for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding.
In 2003, other items, net consisted of a benefit for the recovery of costs and expenses associated with a legal award related to an arbitration proceeding with Johnson& Johnson of $74 million, partially offset by a charitable contribution to the Amgen Foundation of $50 million.
(See Note 12, Other items, net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 24.5%, 30.4%, and 28.8% for 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively.
Our effective tax rate for 2005 has decreased primarily due to favorable resolution of prior year foreign tax credit claims and research and development tax credits with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the absence of the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisition of Tularik in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
The 2004 effective tax rate was higher than the 2003 effective tax rate due to the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs of $554 million in connection with the acquisition of Tularik. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on our controlled foreign corporations undistributed earnings that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States.
On October22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate. The tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately $43 million.
(See Note 3, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) 63 Stock option expense In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.123R, Share-Based Payment. Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided for a phase-in implementation process for SFAS No.123R, which required us to adopt the new accounting standard no later than January1, 2006. SFAS No.123R requires us to account for our stock options using a fair-value-based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements. Prior to January1, 2006, we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under APB No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations, which generally results in no employee stock option expense. We adopted SFAS No.123R on January1, 2006 and do not plan to restate our financial statements for prior periods. We plan to continue to use the Black-Scholes option valuation model in estimating the fair value of the stock option awards issued under SFAS No.123R. The adoption of SFAS No.123R will have a material impact on our results of operations. The actual annual stock option expense in 2006 is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted, our common stock price and related expected volatility, and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant. We expect the impact of stock option compensation expense to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.14 per share in 2006 compared to $0.19 for 2005 (see Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Employee stock options in the Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated impact of stock option expense for 2006 is less than the corresponding pro forma expense amount for 2005 principally due to a reduction in the estimated number of stock options to be granted in 2006 in favor of a combination of other equity awards. Other equity awards are comprised of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance units. Stock-based compensation expense relating to these other equity awards for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 was $106 million and $45 million, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2003, stock-based compensation expense relating to other equity awards was not significant.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (amounts in millions): December31, 2005 December31, 2004 Cash, cash   equivalents, and marketable securities $ 5,255 $ 5,808 Total assets 29,297 29,221 Current debt  1,173 Non-current debt 3,957 3,937 Stockholders equity 20,451 19,705 We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities (see Item 1. Business Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix,Inc. for further discussion regarding the proposed Abgenix acquisition). However, in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity, we may raise additional capital from time to time by accessing both public and private markets. (See Financing Arrangements for a discussion regarding February2006 financing activities.) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December31, 2005, approximately $3.1 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the 64 United States. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate under the American Jobs Act. The repatriation of these funds resulted in an increase in our tax provision of $43 million.
The primary objectives for our marketable securities portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed income investments, are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.
Financing arrangements As of December31, 2005 we had convertible notes (30-year, zero-coupon convertible notes) with an accreted value of $1.8 billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of $2.36 billion and yield to maturity of 1.125% (convertible notes). The holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase, generally for cash, all or a portion of their convertible notes on various dates (the Put Option), at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount through the purchase date. The earliest date was on March1, 2006, however, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on that date. The next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on March1, 2007. Accordingly, the convertible notes were classified as non-current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2005. Holders of the convertible notes may convert each of their convertible notes according to the terms as outlined in Note 4, Financing arrangements in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Moodys and Standard& Poors rate our outstanding convertible notes A2 and A+, respectively.
As of December31, 2005 we had $2.0 billion of long-term notes outstanding. These long-term notes consisted of: 1) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.0% and mature in 2009 (the 2009 Notes,), and 2) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 (the 2014 Notes.) Moodys and Standard& Poors rate our outstanding long-term senior notes A2 and A+, respectively.
As of December31, 2005, we had $200 million of additional long-term debt securities outstanding. These long-term debt securities consisted of: 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 (the 2007 Notes) under a $500 million debt shelf registration (the $500 Million Shelf), and 2) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 (the Century Notes). Our outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moodys and A+ by Standard& Poors. Under the $500 Million Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance.
In February2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Convertible Notes) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the 2013 Convertible Notes) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after June30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, 2) if we make specified distributions to holders 65 of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur, or 3) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive: 1) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the excess conversion value). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A total of $3.0 billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program.
Concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The convertible note hedges, which cost an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion, will be recorded as a reduction of equity.
Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May2011 and warrants for 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May2013 (the settlement dates). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million.
We have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November2010. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December31, 2005.
We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration (the $1 Billion Shelf) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock, and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf.
Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December31, 2005, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants.
Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided   by operating activities $ 4,911 $ 3,697 $ 3,567 Net cash used in   investing activities (59 ) (1,399 ) (3,210 ) Net cash used in   financing activities (4,538 ) (1,609 ) (1,372 ) 66 Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December31, 2005 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows).
The increase in cash provided by operations for 2004 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales. This increase was partially offset primarily by the timing of cash payments related to our tax liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows).
Investing Capital expenditures totaled $867 million in 2005 compared with $1.3 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2003. Capital expenditures in 2005 primarily related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of Neulasta  and NEUPOGEN  approved by the FDA in September2005, Thousand Oaks site expansion, Colorado manufacturing expansion, and site development to support the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, also approved by the FDA in September2005.
Capital expenditures in 2004 primarily related to the Thousand Oaks site expansion, the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion. Capital expenditures in 2003 related to the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, and the Seattle research center which was completed in January2004.
We currently estimate 2006 spending on capital projects and equipment to be in excess of $1 billion as we continue to increase our manufacturing and R&D operations globally. The most significant of these expenditures are expected to be incurred with the start of engineering and construction of a new process development, bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill, and finish facility in Ireland, the further expansion of the Puerto Rico bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, and finish facilities, the expansion of R&D operations at existing sites in the United States and the United Kingdom and the construction of a new development center in Uxbridge, United Kingdom. For additional information on our planned capital projects, see Item 1. Business Manufacturing and Raw Materials.
In addition, we expect to spend approximately $2.2 billion by the end of April2006, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition of Abgenix. We will also assume Abgenixs debt in connection with this proposed transaction.
67 Financing In December2004, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in December2005, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December31, 2005, $6.5 billion was available for stock repurchases under these programs. The manner of purchases, amount we spend, and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. Repurchases under our stock repurchase programs reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is as follows (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 26.8 $ 1,675 10.1 $ 650 8.2 $ 451 Second quarter 12.1 750 17.4 1,000 7.3 449 Third quarter 9.5 769 24.0 1,398 4.8 323 Fourth quarter 14.8 1,236 17.6 1,024 9.4 578 Total 63.2 $ 4,430 69.1 $ 4,072 29.7 $ 1,801 (See Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Item 5(c). Changes in Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.) On March2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.2 billion in cash, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes.
We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $1.1 billion, $453 million, and $529 million of cash during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options.
In November2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds totaled $1,989 million and were intended for purchases of stock under the stock repurchase program then in affect and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital.
In February2006, we raised $5.0 billion of cash proceeds by issuing convertible notes at par in a private placement. Of the $5.0 billion convertible notes, $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125 percent and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375 percent and are due in 2013. A total of $3.0 billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. Concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. Also in February2006, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May2013. For further information on these transactions, see Financing arrangements above.
68 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations.
Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Accordingly, the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties and purchase price consideration for proposed mergers and acquisitions (see Item 1. Business Joint Ventures and Business Relationships Abgenix,Inc.), all of which are contingent upon certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development milestones, regulatory approvals, product sales, and shareholder approval for proposed transactions. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.
The following chart represents our contractual obligations as of December31, 2005, aggregated by type (in millions): Paymentsduebyperiod Contractualobligations Total Lessthan 1year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Morethan 5years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 5,326 $ 103 $ 2,081 (2) $ 1,150 $ 1,992 Operating lease obligations 658 74 129 94 361 Purchase obligations(3) 2,879 1,249 1,014 331 285 Total contractual   obligations $ 8,863 $ 1,426 $ 3,224 $ 1,575 $ 2,638 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2005 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the convertible notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2007 Notes, the 2009 Notes, the 2014 Notes, and the Century Notes at fixed rates of 6.5%, 4.00%, 4.85%, and 8.1%, respectively, through maturity in 2007, 2009, 2014, and 2097, respectively.
(2) Holders of the convertible notes could have required us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as March1, 2006 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount (accreted value) through the purchase dates. However, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. Consequently, the amounts above reflect the convertible notes accreted value on March1, 2007, the next put date. (See Note 4, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (1)our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (2)R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (3)capital expenditures for engineering and construction which primarily relate to the Colorado manufacturing projects, Thousand Oaks research and development expansion and site development, Rhode Island site development, and certain ongoing Puerto Rico manufacturing projects; and (4)open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the 69 ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.
Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products other than EPOGEN  (see EPOGEN  revenue recognition below) are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. This typically occurs at the time products are shipped to the customer, generally a wholesale distributor.
In the United States, we utilize these wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data, and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns.
Accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts, and other incentives (collectively sales incentives) are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.
Reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following (amounts in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Rebates $ 1,344 $ 1,033 $ 520 Wholesaler   chargebacks 1,559 1,069 553 Discounts and   other incentives 891 490 286 Total sales incentives $ 3,794 $ 2,592 $ 1,359 Percent of gross product   sales 24 % 20 % 15 % Rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies in the United States are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually-specified sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s)to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $1,344 million in 2005, $1,033 million in 2004, and $520 million in 2003. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. For example, a 5% change in the revenue reduction 70 attributable to rebates recognized in 2005 would have had an approximate $65 million effect on our reported product sales in 2005.
Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1,559 million in 2005, $1,069 million in 2004, and $553 million in 2003. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability.
Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (amounts in millions): Balanceat Beginningof Period Amounts ChargedAgainst ProductSales* Payments Balanceat Endof Period Year ended: December31, 2005 $ 589 $ 3,794 $ 3,519 $ 864 December31,   2004 $ 358 $ 2,592 $ 2,361 $ 589 * Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented approximately 1% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both 2005 and 2004.
Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales returns have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales.
EPOGEN  revenue recognition We have the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics, and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. We granted to Johnson& Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. Pursuant to this license, Amgen and Johnson& Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other partys exclusive market, sometimes referred to as spillover. Accordingly, we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of Johnson& Johnson and do recognize the product sales made by Johnson& Johnson into our exclusive market. Sales in our exclusive market are derived from our sales to our customers, as adjusted for spillover. We are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each partys spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. We initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based 71 on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN  sales. However, such differences to date have not been material.
Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital, and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate.
The American Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October22, 2004. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate on a qualifying repatriation of earnings by providing for an 85% dividend-received deduction. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced rate. The tax expense incurred on this repatriation was approximately $43 million. We intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act.
Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, tax claims, and governmental investigations. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.
Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the IRS and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters.
While it is not possible to predict accurately or determine the eventual outcome of these matters, we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution in any quarterly reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third-party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:  determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects,  projecting regulatory approvals, 72  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects,  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.
We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.
Item 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our investment portfolio and debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed our available-for-sale debt securities, comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities, are similar enough to aggregate for presentation purposes. Interest income earned on our fixed income investment portfolio is impacted by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates upon reinvestment of funds received on maturity or sale of securities at the then current market rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our 2007 Notes, 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes, Century Notes and convertible notes because they bear interest at fixed rates. However, in 2003 and 2004, we entered into interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, to protect against possible increases in value of our non-convertible notes, which swapped fixed interest payments for variable interest payments over the lives of the respective notes. For the interest rate swaps, the tables present the notional amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity date. Variable rates relating to the interest rate swaps are the average estimated forward rates for the term of each contract. The notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract. The interest rate swaps related to the available-for-sale debt securities shown in the 2004 table were liquidated in 2005 when the underlying available-for-sale fixed income securities either matured or were sold.

On March2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their March1, 2005 Put Option, we repurchased $1.2 billion, or approximately 40%, of the outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for cash. Concurrently, we amended the terms of the convertible notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders, at their option, to cause us to repurchase the remaining convertible notes on March1, 2006 at the then-accreted value. However, the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date. Consequently, for the December31, 2004 table the amounts above reflect the convertible notes accreted value repurchased on March2, 2005 and the remaining notes accreted value on March1, 2006 (the then next available put date) and for the December31, 2005 table the remaining convertible notes accreted value on March1, 2007, the next available put date. In the event the holders of the convertible notes convert their convertible notes, we generally are required to pay the accreted value in cash. (See Note 4, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. At December31, 2005 and 2004, we had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of our equity investment portfolio. We did not have material equity price risk on the unhedged portion of our equity investment portfolio at December31, 2005 and 2004.
Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately the Euro, as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations. Both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates have been mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that the investments in foreign exchange rates have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our results of operations. As such, the impact to our results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated.

Item 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgens Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgens management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgens management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance Amgens management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgens Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgens disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2005.
Further, management determined that, as of December31, 2005, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
75 Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on those criteria.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing below, which expresses unqualified opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005.
76 Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amgen Inc.
We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Amgen Inc. (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Stockholders The following is a summary of the equity compensation plans, which have shares available for issuance for future grants as of December31, 2005 and were adopted or assumed by the Board without the approval of our stockholders: Amended and Restated 1999 Equity Incentive Plan The Amended and Restated 1999 Equity Incentive Plan (formerly known as the Immunex Corporation 1999 Stock Option Plan) (the 1999 Plan) was assumed pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement between the Company and Immunex Corporation which was approved by the Companys stockholders in May2002. The plan was previously approved by Immunex Corporations shareholders. The 1999 Plan consists of two articles ArticleI which governs awards granted prior to July15, 2002 (the Restatement Date) and ArticleII which governs awards granted on or after the Restatement Date. As the terms of Stock Awards (as defined below) made pursuant to the 1999 Plan going forward are governed exclusively by ArticleII of the plan, the following is a description of the material provisions of ArticleII of the 1999 Plan. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 1999 Plan itself, which was filed as an exhibit to the Companys FormS-8 dated July16, 2002.
Stock Subject to the 1999 Plan.
Subject to adjustments upon certain changes in the common stock, the shares available for issuance under the 1999 Plan upon exercise of the outstanding grants made pursuant to the 1999 Plan are Amgens common stock. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 1999 Plan is 19,273,852. Awards of (i)incentive stock options, (ii)nonqualified stock options, (iii)stock bonuses, and (iv)rights to purchase restricted stock (Stock Award) may be granted under the 1999 Plan.
Administration.
The 1999 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has delegated administration of the 1999 Plan to the committees of the Board.
Eligibility.
Incentive stock options may be granted under the 1999 Plan to all employees (including officers) of Amgen or its affiliates. All employees (including officers) and directors of Amgen or its affiliates and consultants to Amgen or its affiliates, or trusts for the benefit of such an employee, director or consultant or his or her spouse or members of their immediate family (permitted trusts) designated by any such employee, director or consultant, are eligible to receive Stock Awards other than incentive stock options under the 1999 Plan.
For incentive stock options granted under the 1999 Plan, the aggregate fair market value, determined at the time of grant, of the shares of common stock with respect to which such options are exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year (under all such plans of Amgen or any affiliate of Amgen) may not exceed $100,000. No person may receive Stock Awards for more than 649,455 shares of common stock in any calendar year.
Terms of Discretionary Options.
The following is a description of the permissible terms of options granted under the 1999 Plan, other than options awarded to non-employee directors which are described 80 below under the heading Terms of Non-Discretionary Options Awarded to Non-Employee Directors (the options described in this section are referred to as Discretionary Options). Individual Discretionary Option grants may be more restrictive as to any or all of the permissible terms described below.
The exercise price of Discretionary Options must be equal to at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the option grant. The exercise price of Discretionary Options must be paid either: (i)in cash at the time the option is exercised; or (ii)at the discretion of the Board, (a)by delivery of common stock of Amgen that has been held for the period required to avoid a charge to Amgens earnings, (b)pursuant to a deferred payment or other arrangement, or (c)in any other form of legal consideration acceptable to the Board.
Generally, optionees may designate certain specified trusts as beneficiaries with respect to Discretionary Options. In the absence of such a designation, after the death of the optionee, Discretionary Options shall be exercisable by the person(s)to whom the optionees rights pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Generally, during the lifetime of an optionee who is a natural person, only the optionee may exercise the Discretionary Option.
The maximum term of Discretionary Options is 10 years. Absent death, disability or voluntary retirement in certain circumstances, Discretionary Options generally terminate three months after termination of the optionees employment or relationship as a consultant or director of Amgen or any affiliate of Amgen. Individual options by their terms may provide for exercise within a longer period of time following termination of employment or the relationship as a director or consultant.
Discretionary Options either become exercisable in cumulative increments or are exercisable in full immediately. The Board has the power to accelerate the beginning of the period during which an option may be exercised (the vesting date). Options granted from the Restatement Date under the 1999 Plan typically vest at the rate of 25% per year during the optionees employment or service as a consultant. Stock options typically provide for the acceleration of the vesting of options if the optionee voluntarily retires at or after age 60 after having been an employee of Amgen or its affiliate for at least fifteen consecutive years and such retirement is not the result of permanent and total disability (Voluntary Retirement). Generally, if any optionee shall terminate his or her employment or relationship as a director or consultant with Amgen or an affiliate due to death or disability, then, in such event, the vesting date for those Discretionary Options granted to such employee, director or consultant or to the permitted trust of such employee, director or consultant which have not vested as of the date of such employees, directors or consultants termination for reasons of death or disability shall automatically be accelerated in full for those with five or more years or to December31 of the year following the year in which the termination occurs for those with less than five years of employment or relationship with Amgen of such employee, director or consultant. Upon Voluntary Retirement, Discretionary Options shall not terminate until the earlier of the termination date set forth in the applicable grant agreement or eighteen months following the date of Voluntary Retirement. The Board also has the power to accelerate the time during which a Discretionary Option may be exercised. To the extent provided by the terms of a Discretionary Option, an optionee may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligations relating to the exercise of such option by (1)a cash payment upon exercise, (2)by authorizing Amgen to withhold a portion of the stock otherwise issuable to the optionee, (3)by delivering already-owned stock of Amgen or (4)by a combination of these means.
Terms of Non-Discretionary Options Awarded to Non-Employee Directors.
The Board may from time to time adopt award programs under the 1999 Plan providing for the grant of formula or non-discretionary Stock Awards to directors of Amgen who are not employees of Amgen or any affiliate. The terms and conditions of any such program shall be established by the Board in its sole discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan.
81 Terms of Stock Bonuses and Purchases of Restricted Stock.
Stock bonuses and purchases of restricted stock shall be in such form and contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The following is a description of some of the permissible terms of stock bonuses and purchases of restricted stock under the 1999 Plan. Individual stock bonuses or purchases of restricted stock may be more restrictive as to any or all of the permissible terms described below or on different terms and conditions.
The purchase price under each stock purchase agreement shall be determined by the Board and may provide for a nominal purchase price or a purchase price that is less than fair market value of the underlying common stock on the award date. The Board may determine that eligible participants may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to Amgen or for its benefit.
The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement must be paid in accordance with the same terms as Discretionary Options. See Terms of Discretionary Options.
Shares of common stock sold or awarded under the 1999 Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Board. To the extent provided by the terms of a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement, a participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligations relating to the lapsing of a repurchase option or vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award in the same manner as that of Discretionary Options. See Terms of Discretionary Options.
Generally, rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall not be assignable by any participant under the 1999 Plan.
Adjustment Provisions.
If there is any change in the stock subject to the 1999 Plan or subject to any Stock Award granted under the 1999 Plan (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the 1999 Plan and outstanding Stock Awards thereunder will be appropriately adjusted as to the class and the maximum number of shares subject to such plan, the maximum number of shares which may be granted to a participant in a calendar year, the class, number of shares and price per share of stock subject to such outstanding Stock Awards.
Change in Control.
For purposes of the 1999 Plan, a Change in Control occurs at the following times: (i)upon the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of either the then outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or (ii)at the time individuals making up the Incumbent Board (as defined in the 1999 Plan) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; or (iii)immediately prior to the consummation by the Company of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not, immediately thereafter, own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the reorganized, merged or consolidated companys voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, or a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (iv)the occurrence of any other event which the incumbent Board determines is a Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the vesting and exercisability of any outstanding Stock Awards under the 1999 Plan will accelerate. Upon and following such acceleration, at the election of the holder of the Stock Award, the Stock Award may be (a)exercised with respect to stock options or, if the surviving or acquiring corporation agrees to assume the Stock Awards or substitute similar awards, (b)assumed or (c)replaced with substitute Stock Awards. Options not exercised, substituted or assumed prior to or upon the Change in Control shall be terminated.
82 Duration, Amendment and Termination.
The Board may suspend or terminate the 1999 Plan without stockholder approval or ratification at any time or from time to time. No incentive stock options may be granted under the 1999 Plan after February22, 2009. No amendment, suspension or termination may impair the rights or obligations under any Stock Award except with the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted.

Amended and Restated 1997 Equity Incentive Plan (formerly known as the Tularik Inc. 1997 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended) (the Acquired 1997 Plan) was assumed by Amgen in connection with the merger of Tularik Inc. with and into Amgen SF, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen on August13, 2004. The Acquired 1997 Plan was previously approved by Tularik Inc.s shareholders. The Acquired 1997 Plan consists of two articles ArticleI which governs awards granted prior to August13, 2004 (the Restatement Date) and ArticleII which governs awards granted on or after the Restatement Date. As the terms of options grants made pursuant to the Acquired 1997 Plan going forward are governed exclusively by ArticleII of the plan, the following is a description of the material provisions of ArticleII of the Acquired 1997 Plan. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Acquired 1997 Plan itself, which was filed as an exhibit to the Companys FormS-8 dated August16, 2004.

Absent death, disability or Voluntary Retirement, in certain circumstances, unvested RSUs shall automatically expire and terminate on the date of termination of employment. The Board also has the power to accelerate the vesting period for RSUs or suspend vesting during leaves of absences.
Upon a grantees Voluntary Retirement, the RSUs scheduled to vest between and including the date of such retirement and December31 of the second year following the year in which the retirement occurs shall accelerate to vest immediately. If the grantee terminates his or her employment or relationship as a consultant with Amgen or an affiliate due to death or disability and has been employed for less than five full years, the RSUs scheduled to vest between and including the date of such death or disability and December31 in the first year following such termination, shall accelerate to vest immediately.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2005 1. Summary of significant accounting policies Business Amgen Inc., including its subsidiaries, (Amgen) is a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amgen as well as its wholly owned subsidiaries. We do not have any significant interests in any variable interest entities. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Cash equivalents We consider cash equivalents to be only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and which mature within three months from date of purchase.
Available-for-sale securities We consider our investment portfolio and marketable equity investments available-for-sale as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, realized gains totaled $25 million, $23 million, and $28 million, respectively, and realized losses totaled $20 million, $27 million, and $16 million, respectively. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair values of available-for-sale investments by type of security, contractual maturity, and classification in the balance sheets are as follows (in millions): Gross Gross Estimated Amortized unrealized unrealized fair December31,2005 cost gains losses value Type of security: Corporate debt securities $ 1,556 $ 1 $ (15 ) $ 1,542 U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S.   government agencies 2,699  (16 ) 2,683 Other interest bearing securities 824   824 Total debt securities 5,079 1 (31 ) 5,049 Equity securities 105 8 (1 ) 112 $ 5,184 $ 9 $ (32 ) $ 5,161 F- 6 AMGEN INC.

Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer.
F- 7 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost, which include amounts related to materials, labor, and overhead, is determined in a manner which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories consisted of the following (in millions): December31, 2005 2004 Raw materials $ 145 $ 117 Work in process 758 565 Finished goods 355 206 $ 1,258 $ 888 Depreciation Depreciation of buildings, equipment, furniture, and fixtures is provided over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms. Useful lives by asset category are as follows: Asset Category Years Buildings and improvements 10-40 Manufacturing equipment 5-12 Laboratory equipment 5-12 Furniture, fixtures,   and other equipment 3-15 Property, plant, and equipment Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at historical cost and consisted of the following (in millions): December31, 2005 2004 Land $ 294 $ 285 Buildings and improvements 2,485 2,096 Manufacturing equipment 923 641 Laboratory equipment 618 624 Furniture, fixtures, and other equipment 2,043 1,844 Construction in progress 958 1,302 7,321 6,792 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (2,283 ) (2,080 ) $ 5,038 $ 4,712 We review our property, plant and equipment assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
F- 8 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intangible assets and goodwill Intangible assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years on a straight-line basis (weighted average amortization period of 14.4 years at December31, 2005). As of December31, 2005, intangible assets consisted of the following (dollars in millions): Weightedaverage December31, Intangibleassetssubjecttoamortization amortizationperiod 2005 2004 Acquired product technology rights: Developed product technology 14.3 years $ 3,077 $ 3,077 Core technology 15 years 1,348 1,348 Trade name 15 years 190 190 Other intangible assets 12 years 335 252 4,950 4,867 Less accumulated amortization (1,208 ) (834 ) $ 3,742 $ 4,033 Acquired product technology rights relate to the identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the Immunex Corporation (Immunex) acquisition in July2002. Amortization of acquired product technology rights is included in Amortization of acquired intangible assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization of other intangible assets is principally included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
We had $10,495 million and $10,525 million of goodwill at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which primarily relates to the acquisition of Immunex. The decrease in goodwill from the prior year is due primarily to tax benefits realized upon exercise of Immunex related stock options during the year ended December31, 2005. We perform an impairment test annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.
Product sales Product sales primarily consist of sales of Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), EPOGEN  (Epoetin alfa), Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim)/NEUPOGEN  (Filgrastim), and Enbrel  (etanercept).
We have the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. We sell Epoetin alfa under the brand name EPOGEN  . We have granted to Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (which has assigned its rights under the product license agreement to Ortho Biotech Products, L.P.), a subsidiary of Johnson& Johnson (Johnson& Johnson), a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. The license agreement, which is perpetual, can be terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties, or default. Pursuant to this license, Amgen and Johnson& Johnson are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other partys exclusive market, sometimes referred to as spillover. Accordingly, we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of Johnson& Johnson and do recognize the product sales made by Johnson& Johnson into our exclusive market. Sales in our exclusive market are derived from our sales to our customers, as adjusted for F- 9 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) spillover. We are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each partys spillover based on estimates of and subsequent adjustments thereto of third-party data on shipments to end users and their usage.
Sales of our other products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts, and other incentives (collectively sales incentives) and returns.
Other revenues Other revenues consist of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded in accordance with contract terms when third-party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Royalty estimates are made in advance of amounts collected using historical and forecasted trends. Pursuant to the license agreement with Johnson& Johnson, noted above, we earn a 10% royalty on sales of Epoetin alfa by Johnson& Johnson in the United States. Corporate partner revenues are primarily comprised of amounts earned from Kirin-Amgen,Inc. (KA) for certain research and development (R&D) activities and are generally earned as the R&D activities are performed and the amounts become due (see Note 2, Related party transactions). In addition, corporate partner revenues include license fees and milestone payments associated with collaborations with third parties. Revenue from non-refundable, upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones, as defined in the respective agreements. Our collaboration agreements with third parties are performed on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success.
Research and development costs R&D costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing R&D activities: salaries and benefits, overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. R&D expenses also include such costs related to activities performed on behalf of corporate partners.
Acquired in-process research and development The fair value of acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred. In 2004, as part of the acquisition of Tularik Inc. (Tularik), we wrote off $554 million of IPR&D (see Note 7, Acquisitions). Acquired IPR&D is considered part of total R&D expense.
Selling, general and administrative costs Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal, and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; and other general and administrative costs.
F- 10 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We have a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth. Under the terms of this agreement, Amgen and Wyeth market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada and develop certain future indications of ENBREL for use in these geographic territories. The rights to detail and promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada for oncology indications are reserved for us. Wyeth is paid a share of the resulting profits on sales of ENBREL, after deducting the applicable costs of sales, including manufacturing costs and royalties paid to third parties, and expenses associated with R&D and sales and marketing. Such amounts paid to Wyeth are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The rights to market ENBREL outside of the United States and Canada are reserved to Wyeth. We also have a global supply agreement with Wyeth related to the manufacture, supply, inventory, and allocation of supplies of ENBREL.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, advertising costs were $109 million, $73 million, and $56 million, respectively.
Interest costs Interest costs are expensed as incurred, except to the extent such interest is related to construction in progress, in which case interest is capitalized. Interest expense, net for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $99 million, $38 million, and $31 million, respectively. Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, were $30 million, $20 million, and $24 million, respectively. Interest paid, net of interest rate swap settlement activity, during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, totaled $84 million, $13 million, and $19 million, respectively.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Potential common shares outstanding include stock options under our employee stock option plans and potential issuances of stock under our other equity incentive plans and under the assumed conversion of our Modified Convertible Notes utilizing the treasury stock method (collectively Dilutive Securities). Potential common shares outstanding also include common shares to be issued under the assumed conversion of our Convertible Notes under the if-converted method. For further information regarding our convertible notes, see Note 4, Financing arrangements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table sets forth the computation for basic and diluted EPS (in millions, except per share information): YearsendedDecember31, 2005 2004 2003 Income   (Numerator): Net income for basic EPS $ 3,674 $ 2,363 $ 2,259 Adjustment for interest   expense on Convertible Notes, net of tax 6 21 21 Income for diluted EPS,   after assumed conversion of Convertible   Notes $ 3,680 $ 2,384 $ 2,280 Shares (Denominator): Weighted-average shares   for basic EPS 1,236 1,271 1,288 Effect of Dilutive   Securities 12 14 23 Effect of Convertible   Notes, after assumed conversion of Convertible Notes 10 35 35 Adjusted   weighted-average shares for diluted EPS 1,258 1,320 1,346 Basic earnings per share $ 2.97 $ 1.86 $ 1.75 Diluted earnings   per share $ 2.93 $ 1.81 $ 1.69 As of December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we had employee stock options to purchase 3 million, 51 million, and 38 million shares, respectively, with exercise prices greater than the average market prices of common stock for each of the respective years.
Employee stock options In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.123R, Share-Based Payment. Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided for a phase-in implementation process for SFAS No.123R, which required us to adopt the new accounting standard no later than January1, 2006. SFAS No.123R requires us to account for our stock options using a fair-value-based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements. Prior to January1, 2006, we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under APB No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations, which generally results in no employee stock option expense. We adopted SFAS No.123R on January1, 2006 and do not plan to restate our financial statements for prior periods. We plan to continue to use the Black-Scholes option valuation model in estimating the fair value of the stock option awards issued under SFAS No.123R. The adoption of SFAS No.123R will have a material impact on our results of operations. The actual annual stock option expense in 2006 is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted, our common stock price and related expected volatility, and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant. We expect the impact of stock option compensation expense to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.14 per share in 2006 compared to $0.19 for 2005. The estimated impact of stock option expense for 2006 is less than the corresponding pro forma expense amount for 2005 principally due to a reduction in the estimated number of stock options to be granted in 2006 in favor of a combination of other equity awards. Other equity awards are comprised of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance units. Stock-based compensation expense relating to these other equity awards for the years ended December31, 2005 and F- 12 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2004 was $106 million and $45 million, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2003, stock-based compensation expense relating to other equity awards was not significant.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123R on January1, 2006 and for all periods reported herein, we accounted for our employee stock options under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations and disclosed the effect on net income and EPS if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We grant our employee stock options at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time resulting in no employee stock option expense reflected in net income. Accordingly, the application of APB No.25 for us generally resulted in no stock option expense.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and EPS if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 (see Note 6, Employee stock options)(in millions, except per share information): YearsendedDecember31, 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 3,674 $ 2,363 $ 2,259 Stock based   compensation, net of tax (233 ) (292 ) (198 ) Pro forma net income $ 3,441 $ 2,071 $ 2,061 Earnings per share: Basic $ 2.97 $ 1.86 $ 1.75 Impact of stock option expense (0.19 ) (0.23 ) (0.15 ) Basic pro forma $ 2.78 $ 1.63 $ 1.60 Diluted $ 2.93 $ 1.81 $ 1.69 Impact of stock option expense (0.19 ) (0.23 ) (0.14 ) Diluted pro   forma $ 2.74 $ 1.58 $ 1.55 Derivative instruments We use financial instruments, including foreign currency forward, foreign currency option, equity forward, and interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates, equity market price fluctuations, and interest rates. The use of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the risk or cost to us. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives.
We recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., unrealized gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For derivatives designated as hedges, we also formally assess, both at inception and periodically thereafter, whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Our derivatives that are not designated and do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings.
F- 13 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Periodically, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to protect against possible changes in values of certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily resulting from sales in Europe. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the gains and losses on these forward and option contracts are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest and other income, net in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. No portions of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and there are no material ineffective portions of these hedging instruments. At December31, 2005 and 2004, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges were not material. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These forward contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly, gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in interest and other income, net in the current period. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts were not material.
To protect against possible reductions in value of certain of our available-for-sale marketable equity securities and certain available-for-sale fixed income investments, we have entered into equity forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. The gains and losses on the equity forward contracts as well as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged equity securities are recognized in interest and other income, net in the current period. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, gains and losses on the portions of these equity forwards excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and the ineffective portions of these hedging instruments were not material. The interest rate swap agreements were liquidated in 2004 and in 2005 when the underlying available-for-sale fixed income securities either matured or were sold. The terms of the interest rate swap agreements corresponded to the related hedged investments for the periods that both the interest rate swap agreements and the related hedged investments were outstanding. As a result, there was no hedge ineffectiveness. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, gains and losses on these interest rate swap agreements were fully offset by the losses and gains on the hedged investments.
We also have interest rate swap agreements, which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges, to protect against possible increases in value of certain debt instruments. The terms of the interest rate swap agreements correspond to the related hedged debt instruments. As a result, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, gains and losses on these interest rate swap agreements were not material and were fully offset by the losses and gains on the hedged debt instruments.
Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
2. Related party transactions We own a 50% interest in KA, a corporation formed in 1984 with Kirin Brewery Company, Limited (Kirin) for the development and commercialization of certain products based on advanced biotechnology. We account for our interest in KA under the equity method and include our share of KAs profits or losses in Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, our share of KAs profits or losses were $58 million, F- 14 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) $25 million, and ($2) million, respectively. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of our equity method investment in KA was $180 million and $132 million, respectively, and is included in non-current other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. KAs revenues consist of royalty income related to its licensed technology rights. All of our rights to manufacture and market certain products including erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), darbepoetin alfa, and pegfilgrastim are pursuant to exclusive licenses from KA. We currently market certain of these products under the brand names EPOGEN  (erythropoietin), NEUPOGEN  (G-CSF), Aranesp  (darbepoetin alfa), and Neulasta  (pegfilgrastim). KA receives royalty income from us, as well as Kirin, Johnson& Johnson, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and others under separate product license agreements for certain geographic areas outside of the United States. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, KA earned royalties from us of $288 million, $266 million, and $216 million, respectively, which are included in Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
KAs expenses primarily consist of costs related to R&D activities conducted on its behalf by Amgen and Kirin. KA pays Amgen and Kirin for such services at negotiated rates. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we earned revenues from KA of $113 million, $187 million, and $68 million, respectively, for certain R&D activities performed on KAs behalf, which are included in Other revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
3. Income taxes The provision for income taxes includes the following (in millions): YearsendedDecember31, 2005 2004 2003 Current   provision: Federal $ 1,079 $ 809 $ 1,155 State 82 88 93 Foreign 128 78 108 Total current provision 1,289 975 1,356 Deferred (benefit) provision: Federal (90 ) 52 (402 ) State (7 ) 14 (40 ) Foreign 2 (9 )  Total deferred (benefit) provision (95 ) 57 (442 ) $ 1,194 $ 1,032 $ 914 F- 15 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Deferred income taxes reflect the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): December31, 2005 2004 Deferred tax assets: Intercompany inventory related items $ 454 $ 449 Expense accruals 205 208 Acquired net operating loss and credit carryforwards 189 233 Other 151 163 Total deferred tax assets 999 1,053 Valuation allowance (102 ) (57 ) Net deferred tax assets 897 996 Deferred tax   liabilities: Acquired intangibles (1,356 ) (1,486 ) Financing debt instrument (30 ) (147 ) Fixed assets (85 )  Other (44 ) (38 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (1,515 ) (1,671 ) $ (618 ) $ (675 ) At December31, 2005, we had net current deferred tax assets of $543 million, primarily composed of temporary differences related to inventory, accrued liabilities, and financing debt instruments, as well as acquired net operating losses and credits. At December31, 2004, our net current deferred tax assets were $618 million.
At December31, 2005, we had operating loss carryforwards of $138 million available to reduce future federal taxable income, which begin expiring in 2008. In addition, we had operating loss carryforwards of $310 million available to reduce future taxable income in various state taxing jurisdictions. We have provided a valuation allowance against $310 million of the state operating loss carryforwards. The state operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2007.
The reconciliation between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate is as follows: Taxrateforthe yearsendedDecember31, 2005 2004 2003 Statutory rate   applied to income before income taxes 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Foreign earnings   including earnings invested indefinitely (10.3 )% (12.8 )% (7.5 )% State taxes 1.5 % 3.0 % 1.7 % Acquired   IPR&D 0.0 % 5.7 % 0.0 % Utilization of   tax credits, primarily research and experimentation (0.7 )% (0.5 )% (0.6 )% Other, net (1.0 )% 0.0 % 0.2 % 24.5 % 30.4 % 28.8 % F- 16 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. At December31, 2005, these earnings amounted to approximately $3,635 million. If these earnings were repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay approximately $1,330 million of additional taxes based on the current tax rates in effect. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, our total foreign profits before income taxes were approximately $1,830 million, $1,443 million, and $956 million, respectively. These earnings include income from manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico under tax incentive grants that expire in 2020.
On October22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provided a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate by providing an 85% dividend-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate. The tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately $43 million.
Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters.
Income taxes paid during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, totaled $840 million, $1,138 million, and $397 million, respectively.
4. Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements as of December31, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): December31, 2005 2004 Convertible notes $ 1,759 $ 2,912 4.85% notes due   2014 (2014 notes) 1,000 1,000 4.00% notes due   2009 (2009 notes) 998 998 6.5% debt   securities due 2007 (2007 notes) 100 100 8.1% notes due   2097 (Century notes) 100 100 Total borrowings 3,957 5,110 Less current   portion  1,173 Total non-current   debt $ 3,957 $ 3,937 Convertible notes As of December31, 2004, we had Convertible Notes (30-year, zero-coupon convertible notes) with an accreted value of $2.9 billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of $3.95 billion ($1,000 face amount per note) and yield to maturity of 1.125%. The original issue discount of $1.13 billion (prior to F- 17 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) repurchase of a portion of the Convertible Notes discussed below) or $285.77 per note is being accreted to the balance of the Convertible Notes and recognized as interest expense over the life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method.
The holders of the Convertible Notes had the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on March1, 2005. On March2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the Convertible Notes exercising this March1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.59 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes for their then-accreted value of $1,175 million in cash, or approximately 40% of our then outstanding Convertible Notes. Upon the repurchase of such Convertible Notes, a pro rata portion, $20 million, of the related debt issuance costs were immediately charged to interest expense in the quarter ending March31, 2005. We made an aggregate cash payment of $22 million to the holders of the Convertible Notes who did not exercise the put option and continued to hold outstanding Convertible Notes subsequent to March1, 2005. This payment was approximately equal to 1.25% of each Convertible Notes then-accreted value and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Concurrently, we amended the terms of the Convertible Notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders, at their option, to cause us to repurchase the Convertible Notes on March1, 2006 at the then-accreted value. Accordingly, the portion of the Convertible Notes outstanding at December31, 2004 not repurchased on March2, 2005 was classified as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
On May6, 2005, we exchanged new zero-coupon senior convertible notes (the Modified Convertible Notes) and a cash payment of approximately $6 million for approximately 95% of the remaining Convertible Notes then outstanding. In August2005, we exchanged substantially all of the remaining Convertible Notes. The changes to the Convertible Notes outstanding as a result of the Mayand August2005 exchanges combined with those made in March2005 are being accounted for as a debt modification. Accordingly, all cash paid to the holders of the Modified Convertible Notes and Convertible Notes (collectively, the convertible notes) is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible notes using the effective interest method, and the costs incurred to modify the terms of the convertible notes were expensed as incurred. As of December31, 2005, convertible notes with an accreted value of $1.8 billion and having an aggregate face amount of $2.36 billion remained outstanding. Because the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on March1, 2006, the next available put date, the convertible notes were classified as non-current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2005.
The significant terms of the convertible notes are as follows:  Holders of Convertible Notes and Modified Convertible Notes may convert each of their notes based on a conversion rate of 8.8601 shares of common stock of Amgen as defined below. The conversion price per share of the convertible notes as of any day will equal the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to that day, divided by the conversion rate or $84.15 as of December31, 2005. The conversion price per share at issuance of the Convertible Notes was $80.61. While the Convertible Notes are convertible into common stock at any time, the Modified Convertible Notes can only be converted if: 1) the closing price of common stock exceeds the conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous calendar quarter, 2) we call the Modified Convertible Notes for redemption, or 3) we make certain significant distributions to common stockholders or enter into specified types of corporate transactions.
F- 18 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)  If converted, the Convertible Notes will be settled for a specified number of shares of common stock-based on the stated conversion rate. The conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes will be settled for a conversion value equal to the product of the conversion rate (8.8601 shares of Amgen common stock per note as of December31, 2005) multiplied by the average closing price of our common stock during a specified period following the conversion date. The conversion value is paid in: 1) cash equal to the lesser of the accreted value of the Modified Convertible Notes at the conversion date or the conversion value, and 2) shares of common stock, if any, to the extent the conversion value exceeds the accreted value.
The conversion rate of the Convertible Notes will be adjusted to the extent we pay cash dividends equal to, or in excess of, a specified amount in any 12-month period. The conversion rate of the Modified Convertible Notes will be adjusted for any cash dividend paid by an amount equal to the dividend divided by the average closing price of common stock during a specified period immediately prior to the ex-dividend date.
The holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on March1, 2007, March1, 2012, and March1, 2017 at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount to the purchase dates. In such event, under the terms of the Convertible Notes, we have the right to pay the purchase price in cash and/or shares of common stock, which would be issued at the then current market price. If holders of the Modified Convertible Notes exercise their option, we must pay the accreted value solely in cash.
If certain conditions are met, we are required to pay contingent interest on the Convertible Notes for a specified period of time equal to the greater of: 1) our cash dividends per share paid multiplied by the conversion rate or 2) a specified percentage of the market price of the Convertible Notes, as defined. Contingent interest on the Modified Convertible Notes must be paid if these same conditions are met but in an amount equal to a specified percentage of the market price of the Modified Convertible Notes, as defined, without regard to the amount of cash dividends paid, if any.
We may redeem all or a portion of the convertible notes for cash at any time on or after March1, 2007 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount as of the redemption date.
Medium and long-term notes In November2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% notes due 2009 (the 2009 Notes) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% notes due 2014 (the 2014 Notes). The net proceeds of these two issuances totaled $1,989 million.
We had $100 million of debt securities outstanding at December31, 2005 and 2004 with a fixed rate of 6.5% that mature in 2007 (the 2007 Notes), which were issued under our $500 million debt shelf registration statement (the $500 Million Shelf) which was established in 1997. See below for additional information on the $500 Million Shelf.
F- 19 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) We had $100 million of debt securities outstanding at December31, 2005 and 2004 with a fixed interest rate of 8.1% that mature in 2097 (the Century Notes). These securities may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time for a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal and remaining interest payments discounted at a determined rate plus, in each case, accrued interest.
Shelf registrations and other facilities In July2004, we established a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November2010. Additionally, we increased the size of our commercial paper authorization by $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December31, 2005.
In October2003, we established a $1.0 billion shelf registration (the $1 Billion Shelf) to provide for financial flexibility. The $1 Billion Shelf allows us to issue debt securities, common stock, and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. Under the $1 Billion Shelf, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf.
In 1997, pursuant to the $500 Million Shelf, we established a $400 million medium-term note program. All of the $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December31, 2005, no securities were outstanding under the $400 million medium-term note program. We do have $100 million of long-term debt securities outstanding under the $500 million shelf, as discussed above.
Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December31, 2005, we are in compliance with all applicable covenants.
Contractual maturities of long-term debt obligations The aggregate contractual maturities of all long-term debt obligations due subsequent to December31, 2005, are as follows (in millions): Maturitydate Amount 2006 $  2007(1) 1,882 2008  2009 1,000 2010  After 2010 1,100 $ 3,982 (1) Included in this amount is the remaining convertible notes accreted value on March1, 2007, the next put date (see convertible notes above).

Stockholders equity Stockholder Rights Agreement We have an amended and restated preferred stock rights plan effective through December12, 2010 pursuant to which each share of common stock outstanding and each subsequently issued share have attached to them one whole preferred share purchase right (a Right). The Right represents the right to purchase one four-thousandth (1/4000) of a share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock of Amgen at $350.00. These Rights expire on December12, 2010.
Under certain circumstances, if an acquiring person or group acquires 10% or more of our outstanding common stock, an exercisable Right will entitle its holder (other than the acquirer) to buy shares of common stock of Amgen having a market value of two times the exercise price of one Right. However, in limited circumstances approved by the outside directors of the Board of Directors, a stockholder who enters into an acceptable standstill agreement may acquire up to 20% of the outstanding shares without triggering the Rights. If an acquirer acquires at least 10%, but less than 50%, of our common stock, the Board of Directors may exchange each Right (other than those of the acquirer) for one share of common stock per Right. In addition, under certain circumstances, if we are involved in a merger or other business combination where we are not the surviving corporation, an exercisable Right will entitle its holder to buy shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a market value of two times the exercise price of one Right. We may redeem the Rights at $0.00025 per Right at any time prior to the public announcement that a 10% position has been acquired.
Stock repurchase program In December2004, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in December2005, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December31, 2005, $6.5 billion was available for stock repurchases under these two authorizations.

Employee stock options Employee stock option plans Our employee stock option plans provide for option grants designated as either nonqualified or incentive stock options. Option grants to employees generally vest over a three to five year period and expire seven years from the date of grant. Eligible employees receive a grant of stock options annually with the number of shares generally determined by the employees salary grade and performance level. In addition, certain management and professional level employees typically receive a stock option grant upon commencement of employment.

Therefore, under the principles of APB No.25, we do not recognize compensation expense associated with the grant of employee stock options. SFAS No.123 requires the use of option valuation models to provide supplemental information regarding employee stock options. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Employee stock options for further discussion on accounting for employee stock options.
F- 23 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The weighted average fair value of common stock and stock options on the date of grant, and the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Weighted average   fair value of common stock $ 63.47 $ 59.32 $ 64.44 Weighted average   fair value of stock options granted $18.46 $22.90 $26.04 Risk-free   interest rate 4.0 % 2.6 % 2.4 % Expected life (in   years) 5.0 4.3 4.0 Expected volatility 23.4 % 44.0 % 50.0 % Expected dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options. Our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options such as extremely limited transferability and, in most cases, vesting restrictions. In addition, the assumptions used in option valuation models (see above) are highly subjective, particularly the expected stock price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of our employee stock options. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair values of the options are amortized over the options vesting periods. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies - Employee stock options for a detailed computation of pro forma net income and earnings per share.
During the quarter ended March31, 2005, we revised our method of estimating expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model to reflect the consideration of implied volatility in our publicly traded equity instruments.
7. Acquisitions Tularik Inc.
On August13, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tularik in a transaction accounted for as a business combination. Tularik was a company engaged in drug discovery related to cell signaling and the control of gene expression. We issued 24 million shares in the acquisition. Additionally, we issued 4 million stock options in exchange for Tularik stock options assumed in the acquisition. The purchase price of $1.5 billion, which included the carrying value of our existing ownership interest in Tularik of approximately 21% or $82 million, was allocated to goodwill of $755 million, IPR&D of $554 million (see Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Acquired in-process research and development), and other net assets acquired of $188 million. The amount allocated to IPR&D was immediately expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the three months ended September30, 2004. The estimated fair value of these R&D projects was determined through the assistance of an independent valuation firm and was based on discounted cash flows. The results of Tulariks operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing August14, 2004. Pro forma results of operations for the year ended December31, 2004 assuming the acquisition of Tularik had taken place at the beginning of 2004 would not differ significantly from actual reported results. The merger was structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section368(a)of the Internal Revenue Code. There were no significant adjustments to the purchase price allocation in 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Abgenix,Inc.
In December2005, we signed a definitive merger agreement under which we will pay shareholders of Abgenix $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.2 billion and will assume Abgenixs outstanding debt. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger on January19, 2006 and we expect to close the merger agreement, subject to Abgenix shareholder approval, by April2006.
8. Commitments and contingencies Commitments We lease certain administrative and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire through December2021.

Sublease income for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was not material.
We have supply agreements with various third-party contract manufacturers for the production, vialing, and packaging of ENBREL. Under the terms of these various contracts, we are required to purchase certain minimum quantities of ENBREL each year through 2010. The following table summarizes the minimum contractual inventory commitments from all third-party contract manufacturers at December31, 2005 (in millions): Inventory YearendedDecember31, commitments 2006 $ 269 2007 139 2008 130 2009 132 2010 127 Thereafter 263 Total contractual purchases $ 1,060 The amounts above primarily relate to our long-term supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG (BI Pharma) for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL. Amounts owed to F- 25 AMGEN INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) BI Pharma are based on firm commitments for the purchase of ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved.
Amounts purchased under contractual inventory commitments from third-party contract manufacturers for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $386 million, $268 million, and $282 million, respectively.
Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters, including those that are tax-related. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution in any quarterly reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Major customers In the United States, we sell primarily to wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products. With the exception of ENBREL, we utilize these wholesale distributors as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals, and pharmacies. For ENBREL wholesaler orders, we primarily drop-ship directly to pharmacies. Outside the United States, Aranesp  , Neulasta  , and NEUPOGEN  are principally distributed to hospitals and wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the financial condition of our larger distributors and limit our credit exposure by setting appropriate credit limits, requiring collateral and obtaining credit insurance, where appropriate. We had net product sales to three large wholesaler distributors each accounting for more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. On a combined basis, these distributors accounted for 74% and 94% of total revenues and U.S. product sales, respectively, for 2005, as noted in the following table (in millions).

License Agreement arbitration In September1985, we granted Johnson& Johnsons affiliate, Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, a license relating to certain patented technology and know-how of Amgen to sell Epoetin alfa throughout the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. A number of disputes arose between Amgen and Johnson& Johnson as to their respective rights and obligations under the various agreements between them, including the agreement granting the license (the License Agreement). These disputes between Amgen and Johnson& Johnson have been resolved through binding arbitration. One of these disputes related to the alleged violation of the License Agreement by Johnson& Johnson. In October2002, the Arbitrator issued a final order awarding us $150 million for Johnson& Johnsons breach of the License Agreement. The legal award of $151 million, which included interest, was recorded in the F- 29 AMGEN INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 14.
Subsequent events In February2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Convertible Notes) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the 2013 Convertible Notes) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after June30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, 2) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur, or 3) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive: 1) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the excess conversion value). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A total of $3.0 billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program.
Concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The convertible note hedges, which cost an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion, will be recorded as a reduction of equity.
Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May2011 and warrants for 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May2013 (the settlement dates). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million.
