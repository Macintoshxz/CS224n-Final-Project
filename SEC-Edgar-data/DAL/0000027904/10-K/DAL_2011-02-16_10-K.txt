Other Information On September 14, 2005       (the Petition Date), we and substantially all of our subsidiaries filed       voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States       Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court       for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On December 19,       2006, we filed a Plan of Reorganization (the Plan), which, after amendment, is       being submitted to a vote of creditors and is subject to confirmation by the       Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, current holders of our equity securities       would       not receive any distributions, and the equity securities would be cancelled       upon       the effective date of the Plan. Accordingly, we urge that caution be exercised       with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and       any       of our liabilities or other securities.

PART I ITEM1.
BUSINESS General       Description We       are a major air       carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo       throughout the United States and around the world. We offer customers service       to       more destinations than any other global airline, with Delta and Delta Connection       carrier service to308 destinations in 52 countries. With more than60       new international routes added since 2005, we are       increasing our international service significantly. We are a leader across       the       Atlantic with flights to 31 trans-Atlantic destinations. We also       offer more       than600 weekly       flights to 58 destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean. We are a founding       member of the SkyTeam international alliance, a global airline alliance that       provides customers with extensive worldwide destinations, flights and services.       Including our SkyTeam and worldwide codeshare partners, we offer flights       to462 worldwide destinations in99 countries.
For       the years ended       December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, passenger revenues accounted for 91 %,       90%       and 91% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, and cargo revenues       and other sources accounted for 9 %,       10%       and 9% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively. In 2006, our       operations in North America, the Atlantic, Latin America and the Pacific       accounted for 75 %, 18 %, 6 %       and 1 %,       respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues. In 2005, our operations       in       North America, the Atlantic, Latin America and the Pacific accounted for 80%,       14%, 5% and 1%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues. In 2004,       our operations in North America, the Atlantic, Latin America and the Pacific       accounted for 81%, 14%, 4% and 1%, respectively, of our consolidated operating       revenues.
We       are       incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive       offices are located at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in       Atlanta, Georgia (the Atlanta Airport). Our telephone number is       (404)715-2600, and our Internet address is www.delta.com .       Information contained on this website is not part of, and is not incorporated       by       reference in, this Form 10-K.
1 See Risk Factors       Relating to Delta and Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry in Item       1A and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results       of Operations in Item7 for additional discussion of trends and factors       affecting us and our industry.
Airline Operations Our       route network is       centered around the hub system we operate at airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati,       NewYork(John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)) and       SaltLake City. Each of these hub operations includes Delta flights that       gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding       the hub to domestic and international cities and to other Delta hubs. Our hub       system also provides passengers with access to our principal international       gateways in Atlanta and JFK.
As       briefly discussed below, other key characteristics of our route network include       our alliances with foreign airlines; the Delta Connection program; the Delta       Shuttle; and our domestic marketing alliances, including with Continental       Airlines, Inc. (Continental) and Northwest Airlines, Inc.       (Northwest).
International       Alliances We       have formed bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve       our access to international markets. These arrangements can include codesharing,       reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to       passenger lounges, joint promotions, common use of airport gates and ticket       counters, ticket office co-location and other marketing agreements. These       alliances often present opportunities in other areas, such as airport ground       handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing.
Our       international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of       international destinations. Under international codesharing arrangements, we       and       a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a       single flight operation, thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer       joint service with one aircraft, rather than operating separate services with       two aircraft. These arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign       carriers aircraft that are marketed under our DL designator code and permit       the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the       foreign carriers two-letter designator code. We have international codeshare       arrangements in effect with Aeromexico, Air France, Air Jamaica (currently       expected to terminate on April 30, 2007), Alitalia, Avianca, China Airlines,       China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, El Al Israel Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch       Airlines, Korean Air and Royal Air Maroc (and some affiliated carriers operating       in conjunction with these airlines).
In       addition to our agreements with individual foreign airlines, we are a member       of       the SkyTeam international airline alliance. The other full members of SkyTeam       are Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Air France, Alitalia, Continental, CSA Czech Airlines,       KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Korean Air and Northwest. One goal of SkyTeam is       to       link the route networks of the member airlines, providing opportunities for       increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through       mutual codesharing arrangements, reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs       and coordinated cargo operations.
In       2002,       we, Air France, Alitalia ,       CSA       Czech Airlines and Korean Air received limited antitrust immunity from the       U.S.       Department of Transportation (the DOT) that enables us and our immunized       partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales,       marketing and discount programs for customers.
Delta Connection Program The       Delta       Connection program is our regional carrier service, which feeds traffic to       our       route system through contracts with regional air carriers that operate flights       serving passengers primarily in small- and medium-sized cities. The program       enables us to increase the number of flights we have in certain locations,       to       better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller       markets. The Delta Connection program operates the largest number of regional       jets in the United States.
2 Through       the Delta Connection program, we have contractual arrangements with seven       regional carriers to operate regional jet and, in certain cases, turbo-prop       aircraft using our DL designator code. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Comair,       operates all of its flights under our code. Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc.,       which we sold to SkyWest, Inc. (SkyWest) in September 2005, continues to       operate all of its flights under our code. In addition, we have agreements       with       the following regional carriers that operate some of their flights using our       code: SkyWest Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of SkyWest; Chautauqua Airlines,       Inc., a subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings, Inc. (Republic Holdings);       Shuttle America Corporation, a subsidiary of Republic Holdings; Freedom       Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc.; and American Eagle       Airlines, Inc.
We       generally pay the regional carriers, including Comair, amounts defined in their       respective contract carrier agreements, which are based on a determination       of       the carriers respective cost of operating those flights and other factors       intended to approximate market rates for those services.These agreements       are long-term agreements, usually with initial terms of at least ten years,       that       grant us the option to extend the initial term and provide us the right to       terminate the agreement for convenience at certain future dates. Our arrangement       with Eagle, which is limited to certain flights operated to and from the Los       Angeles International Airport, as well as a portion of the flights operated       by       SkyWest Airlines, are structured as revenue proration agreements. These       proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues       for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries.       For       additional information regarding our contract carrier agreements, see       Note8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Delta Shuttle We       operate a high frequency service targeted to northeast business travelers known       as the Delta Shuttle. The Delta Shuttle provides nonstop, hourly service on       business days between New York - LaGuardia Airport (LaGuardia) and both Boston       - Logan International Airport and Washington,D.C. - Ronald Reagan National       Airport (Reagan).
Domestic Alliances We       have       entered into marketing alliances with (1) Continental and Northwest (including       regional carriers affiliated with each) and (2) Alaska Airlines and Horizon       Air       Industries, both of which include mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent       flyer and airport lounge access arrangements. These marketing relationships       are       designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route       networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting       passengers using the carriers route networks.
Fuel Our       results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and       availability of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our aircraft fuel       consumption and costs for 2004 through 2006.
Gallons Average Percentage                   of Consumed Cost (1) Price                   Per Total                   Operating Year (Millions) (Millions) Gallon (1) Expenses 2006 2,111 $4,319 $2.04 25% 2005 2,492 4,271 1.71 23% 2004 2,527 2,924 1.16 16% (1) Net                 of fuel hedge (losses) gains under our fuel hedging program of ($108)                 million and $105 million for 2006 and 2004, respectively. We had                 no fuel                 hedge contracts in 2005.
Our       aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against       price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase       most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on       various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market,       from       off-shore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price.
3 We       periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which       are comprised of heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts, to manage       our exposure to changes in fuel prices. Information regarding our fuel hedging       program is set forth under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial       Condition and Results of Operations Market Risks Associated with       Financial Instruments Aircraft Fuel Price Risk in Item7 and in       Note4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We       are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is       impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel.       Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars       involving oil-producing countries, changes in government policy concerning       aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft       fuel       production capacity, environmental concerns, and other unpredictable events       may       result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future.
Competition We       face       significant competition with respect to routes, services and fares. Our domestic       routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers, some       of       which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to       destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant competition at       our       hub airports in Atlanta and JFK from other carriers. In addition, our operations       at our hub airports also compete with operations at the hubs of other airlines       that are located in close proximity to our hubs. We also face increasing       competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from rapidly expanding regional       jet operators. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in significant part,       on our ability to maintain a cost structure that is competitive with other       carriers.
In       addition, we compete with foreign carriers, both on interior U.S. routes, due       to       marketing and codesharing arrangements, and in international markets.       International marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers,       including the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines       and others) and the oneworld Alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways       and others) have significantly increased competition in international markets.       Through marketing and codesharing arrangements with U.S.carriers, foreign       carriers have obtained access to interior U.S.passenger traffic.       Similarly, U.S.carriers have increased their ability to sell international       transportation, such as transatlantic services to and beyond European cities,       through alliances with international carriers.
Frequent Flyer       Program We       have a       frequent flyer program, the SkyMiles  program,       which offers incentives to customers to increase travel on Delta. This program       allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on Delta,       Delta Connection carriers and participating airlines. Mileage credit may also       be       earned by using certain services offered by program participants, such as credit       card companies, hotels, car rental agencies, telecommunication services and       internet services. In addition, individuals and companies may purchase mileage       credits. We reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance       notice, and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time without       notice.
Mileage       credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and       participating airlines, for membership in our Crown Room Club and for other       program participant awards. Travel awards are subject to certain transfer       restrictions and capacity-controlled seating. In some cases, blackout dates       may       apply. Program accounts with no activity for 12 consecutive months after       enrollment are deleted. Miles will not expire so long as, at least once every       two years, the participant (1)takes a qualifying flight on Delta or a       Delta Connection carrier, (2)earns miles through one of our program       participants, (3) buys miles from Delta or (4)redeems miles for any       program award.
Regulatory Matters The       DOT       and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise regulatory authority       over air transportation in the United States. The DOT has authority to issue       certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to       provide domestic air transportation. An air carrier that the DOT finds fit       to       operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation       (including the carriage of passengers and cargo). Except for constraints imposed       by regulations regarding Essential Air Services, which are applicable to       certain small communities, airlines may terminate service to a city without       restriction.
4 The       DOT       has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters, such       as       unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition, advertising, denied       boarding compensation, baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation.       The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between       major carriers. The FAA has primary responsibility for matters relating to       air       carrier flight operations, including airline operating certificates, control       of       navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft certification and maintenance       and other matters affecting air safety.
Authority       to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements       is       regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved.       International route awards are also subject to the approval of the President       of       the United States for conformance with national defense and foreign policy       objectives.
The       Transportation Security Administration and the United StatesCustoms and       Border Protection, each a division of the Department of Homeland Security,       are       responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger       and       baggage screening at U.S.airports and international passenger prescreening       prior to entry into or departure from the United States.
Airlines       are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and       regulations. For example, the United StatesDepartment of Justice has       jurisdiction over airline competition matters. The United StatesPostal       Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail. Labor       relations in the airline industry, as discussed below, are generally governed       by       the Railway Labor Act. Environmental matters are regulated by various federal,       state, local and foreign governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and       employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and       regulations.
Fares       and Rates Airlines       set ticket prices in most domestic and international city pairs without       governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by significant price       competition. Certain international fares and rates are subject to the       jurisdiction of the DOT and the governments of the foreign countries involved.       Many of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and fares are subject to       commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel agents, brokers and       wholesalers.
Route       Authority Our       flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and       necessity and, to a limited extent, by exemptions issued by the DOT. The       requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are       controlled by bilateral agreements with, or permits or approvals issued by,       foreign countries. Because international air transportation is governed by       bilateral or other agreements between the United States and the foreign country       or countries involved, changes in United States or foreign government aviation       policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements,       diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect       our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the United States       and       various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time       to       time.
Certain       of our international route and codesharing authorities are subject to periodic       renewal requirements. We request extension of these authorities when and as       appropriate. While the DOT usually renews temporary authorities on routes where       the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service, there is       no       assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific       renewal. Dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases, especially       where another U.S.carrier indicates a willingness to provide       service.
Airport       Access Operations       at three major domesticairports and certain foreign airports served by us       are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar       regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations       at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take       off       from the particular airport during a specified time period.
5 In       the       United States, the FAA currently regulates slot allocations at Reagan in       Washington,D.C., and has imposed analogous regulatory mechanisms which       restrict operations at OHare International Airport in Chicago, and LaGuardia in       New York. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation       of       slots or analogous regulatory authorities. We currently have sufficient slots       or       analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally       been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our       schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in       the       future because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to changes       in       governmental policies.
Environmental       Matters The       Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of       airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so       long       as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign       commerce or the national air transportation system. This statute generally       provides that local noise restrictions on Stage3 aircraft first effective       after October1, 1990, require FAA approval. While we have had sufficient       scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past,       our       operations could be adversely impacted if locally-imposed regulations become       more restrictive or widespread.
The       FAA       issued a final rule, effective August 4, 2005, adopting the International Civil       Aviation Organizations (ICAO) Chapter4 noise standard, which is known       as the Stage4 standard in the United States. This standard requires that       all new commercial jet aircraft designs certificated on or after January1,       2006 be at least ten decibels quieter than the existing Stage3 noise       standard requires. This new standard does not apply to existing aircraft or       to       the continued production of aircraft types already certificated. All new       aircraft that we have on order will meet the proposed Stage4 standard.       Accordingly, the rule is not expected to have any significant impact on       us.
The       U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) is authorized to regulate       aircraft emissions. Our aircraft comply with the applicable EPA standards.       On       November17, 2005, the EPA issued a final rule adopting emissions control       standards for aircraft engines previously adopted by the ICAO. These standards       apply to newly designed engines certified after December31, 2003 and align       the U.S.aircraft engine emission standards with existing international       standards. The rule, as adopted, is not expected to have a material impact       on       us. However, a group of state and local air regulators has filed a petition       for       review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging       the rule on a number of grounds. We are monitoring these       proceedings.
In       December 2004, Miami-Dade County filed a lawsuit in Florida Circuit Court       against us, seeking injunctive relief and alleging responsibility for past       and       future environmental cleanup costs and civil penalties for environmental       conditions at Miami International Airport. This lawsuit is related to several       other actions filed by the County against other parties to recover environmental       remediation costs incurred at the airport. This lawsuit is currently stayed       as a       result of our Chapter 11 proceedings, and we anticipate settling this lawsuit       through the bankruptcy process. Although the ultimate outcome of this matter       cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution       of       this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated       Financial Statements.
We       have       been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible party (a PRP) with       respect to certain Superfund Sites, and have entered into consent decrees       regarding some of these sites. Our alleged disposal volume at each of these       sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all PRPs at each       site. We are aware of soil and/or ground water contamination present on our       current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To address this       contamination, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate,       remediate these sites. We anticipate that many of the environmental liabilities       at Superfund Sites and former leaseholds will be resolved through the bankruptcy       proceedings. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted       with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these matters will       not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial       Statements.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program We       participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (the CRAF Program), which       permits the United Statesmilitary to use the aircraft and crew resources       of participating U.S.airlines during airlift emergencies, national       emergencies or times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF       Program a portion of our international range aircraft from October1, 2006       until September30, 2007. As of October 1, 2006, the following numbers of       our international range aircraft are available for CRAF activation: 6 Stage Description                   of Event                   Leading to Activation International                   Passenger Aircraft                   Allocated Number                   of Aeromedical                   Aircraft Allocated Total                   Aircraft by Stage I Minor                   Crisis 7 N/A 7 II Major                   Theater Conflict 13 13 26 III Total                   National Mobilization 43 44 87 The       CRAF       Program has only been activated twice, both times at the StageI level,       since it was created in 1951.
Regulatory       and Legislative Proposals A       number       of Congressional bills and proposed DOT regulations have been considered in       recent years to address airline competition and other issues. Some of these       proposals would require large airlines with major operations at certain airports       to divest or make available to other airlines slots, gates, facilities and       other       assets at those airports. Other measures would limit the service or pricing       responses of major carriers that appear to target new entrant airlines. In       addition, concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the DOT and       FAA       to consider various proposals for access to certain airports, including congestion-based landing fees and programs that would withdraw slots from       existing carriers and reallocate those slots (either by lottery or auction       to       the highest bidder) to carriers with little or no current presence at such       airports. These proposals, if enacted, could negatively impact our existing       services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines.       Furthermore, recent events related to extreme weather delays may cause the       DOT       to consider proposals related to airlines handling of lengthy flight delays       during extreme weather conditions.
Employee Matters Railway Labor Act Our       relations with labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway       Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act, a labor union seeking to represent       an       unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the National       Mediation Board (the NMB) an application alleging a representation dispute,       along with authorization cards signed by at least 35% of the employees in that       craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the       labor       union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an       election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective       bargaining representative of that craft or class. Under the NMBs usual rules, a       labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft       or class only if more than 50% of those employees vote for union representation.       A certified labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective       bargaining agreement with the employer.
Under       the       Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and       a       labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date.       Either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate       in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement is reached       in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an impasse exists and       offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day       cooling off period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may       engage in self help, unless the President of the United States appoints a       Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) to investigate and report on the dispute.       The appointment of a PEB maintains the status quo for an additional       60days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the       parties may then engage in self help. Self help includes, among other       things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the       collective bargaining agreement by the airline. Congress and the President       have       the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation that, among other       things, imposes a settlement on the parties.
7 Collective       Bargaining As       of       December 31, 2006, we had a total of approximately 51,300full-time       equivalent employees. Approximately 17% of these employees are represented       by       unions. The following table presents certain information concerning the union       representation of our active domestic employees.
Employee                 Group Approximate Number                 of Employees Represented Union Date                 on which Collective Bargaining                 Agreement Becomes                 Amendable Delta                 Pilots 5,810 ALPA December                 31, 2009 Delta                 Flight Superintendents 170 PAFCA January                 1, 2010 Comair                 Pilots 1,345 ALPA May                 21, 2007 (1) Comair                 Maintenance Employees 535 IAM December                 31, 2010 Comair                 Flight Attendants 880 IBT December                 31, 2010 (1) On                 February 12, 2007, Comair and ALPA reached a tentative agreement                 to reduce                 Comairs pilot labor costs. The agreement is subject to ratification by                 Comair pilots and Bankruptcy Court approval. If ratified and approved,                 the                 agreement would become effective March2,2007 and become                 amendable on                 March2,2011.
Labor       unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups       of       employees of Delta and Comair that are not represented for collective bargaining       purposes. The timing and outcome of these organizing efforts cannot presently       be       determined.
For       additional information about our collective bargaining agreements, see Note       1 of       the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additional Information We       make available free of charge on our website our Annual Report on       Form10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q, our Current Reports on       Form8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable       after these reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange       Commission. Information on our website is not incorporated into this       Form10-K or our other securities filings and is not a part of those       filings.
8 ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS Risk Factors Relating to Delta We       filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on       September14, 2005 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties       associated with Chapter11 proceedings.
For       the duration of our Chapter11 proceedings, our operations, including our       ability to execute our business plan, are subject to the risks and uncertainties       associated with bankruptcy. Risks and uncertainties associated with our       Chapter11 proceedings include the following:  our                 ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate our proposed                 Plan;  the                 actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who                 have                 interests in our Chapter11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with                 our plans;  our                 ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions in the                 Chapter11 proceedings prosecuted from time to time;  our                 ability to obtain and maintain normal terms with vendors and service                 providers;  our                 ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;                 and  risks                 associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval                 to                 terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to confirm our                 proposed                 Plan, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee or to convert the cases to                 Chapter 7                 cases.
These       risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various       ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our       Chapter11 proceedings could adversely affect our sales of tickets and the       relationship with our customers, as well as with vendors and employees, which       in       turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly       if the Chapter11 proceedings are unexpectedly protracted. Also,       transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior       approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely       to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities.
Because       of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter11 proceedings,       the ultimate impact that events that occur during these proceedings will have       on       our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately       predicted or quantified.
Our       business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued       periods of historically high fuel costs will continue to materially adversely       affect our operating results. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply       of       aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating       results.
Our       operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and       availability of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices increased substantially in 2004,       2005       and 2006. In 2006, our average fuel price per gallon rose 19% to $2.04 as       compared to an average price of $1.71 in 2005, which was 47% higher than our       average price of $1.16 in 2004. In 2003, our average fuel price per gallon       was       81.78. The fuel costs represented 25%, 23%, and 16% of our operating expenses       in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These increasing costs have had a       significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial       condition.
Our       ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited       by       the competitive nature of the airline industry. We often have not been able       to       increase our fares to fully offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the       past and we may not be able to do so in the future.
9 In       addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material       protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel       supplies. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish       the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel on       the       spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners       to set the price. To attempt to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices,       we periodically use       derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which are comprised       of       heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts ,       though       we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure. Depending on the type       of hedging instrument used, our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices       may be limited.
We       are       currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is       impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel.       Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars       involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning       aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft       fuel       production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events       may       result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the       future. Additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies       could       have additional negative effects on us.
Our       substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and       may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future       needs.
We       will       have substantial indebtedness even if our Plan is consummated. Our substantial       indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, our substantial       indebtedness could:  require us                 to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to                 the                 payment of principal, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing                 the                 funds available for other purposes;  make us                 more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions                 or                 catastrophic external events;  limit our ability to withstand competitive                 pressures;  reduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business                 and                 economic conditions;and/or  place us                 at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have relatively                 less                 debt than we have.
In addition ,       a       substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional       financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital       expenditures and general corporate purposes. We have historically had       substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business. These liquidity       needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic       conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors not within       our       control. Substantial indebtedness, along with other factors, will limit our       ability to obtain financing to meet such liquidity needs.
Our       exit financing credit facility will include financial and other covenants that       will impose restrictions on our financial and business       operations.
As       part       of the Plan, we expect to enter into an exit financing credit facility with       various lenders from whom we have received commitments. This credit facility       will contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain a minimum       fixed charge ratio, minimum unrestricted cash reserves and minimum collateral       coverage ratios. In addition, our exit financing credit facility will restrict       our ability to, among other things, incur additional secured indebtedness,       make       investments, sell assets if not in compliance with coverage ratio tests, pay       dividends or repurchase stock. These covenants may have a material impact on       our       operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with the covenants in the exit       financing credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an       event of default would result under the exit financing credit       facility.
The       exit       financing credit facility is also expected to contain other events of default       customary for financings of this type, including cross defaults to certain       other       indebtedness and certain change of control events. If an event of default were       to occur, the lenders could declare outstanding borrowings under these       agreements immediately due and payable. We cannot provide assurance that we       would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance borrowings under the       exit       financing credit facility if accelerated upon an event of default. In addition,       an event of default or declaration of acceleration under the exit financing       credit facility could also result in an event of default under other       indebtedness.
10 The       closing and funding of the exit financing credit facility is subject to the       completion of definitive documentation and other conditions.
Employee       strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our       operations.
Our       business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight       attendants and other personnel. Approximately 18% of our workforce is unionized.       Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect       our       ability to conduct business. Relations between air carriers and labor unions       in       the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that       a       collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not       expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor       Act       generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before       and       after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until       the       collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been       exhausted.
In       addition, if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of       our       unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their       collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce       become unionized, they may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages,       subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act and the Bankruptcy Code.       See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information       about Comairs negotiations with its work groups. Likewise, if third party       regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable       to       reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future       negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements,       those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to       the       requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on       our       operations.
Interruptions       or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material       adverse impact on our operations.
Our       business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta Airport and       at       our other hub airports in Cincinnati, JFK and Salt Lake City. Each of these       hub       operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets       in       the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other       Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption in service at the Atlanta       airport or at one of the companys other hubs could have a serious impact on our       business, financial condition and results of operations.
We       are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations, and if our       technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology,       our       business may be adversely affected.
We       have       become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and       to       enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business       environment. For example, we have made significant investments in delta.com,       check-in kiosks, Delta Direct phone banks and related initiatives. The       performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to       attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. These       initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our       technology infrastructure to deliver these expected benefits. If we are unable       to make these investments, our business and operations could be negatively       affected.
In       addition, any internal technology error or failure or large scale external       interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power,       telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any       individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our       customer service and result in increased costs. Like all companies, our       technology systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources       of       interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters,       terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and       other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in,       technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures       may       not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and       its       adverse financial consequences to our business.
11 If       we experience further losses of senior management and other key employees,       our       operating results could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to attract       and retain additional qualified management personnel.
We       are       dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other       key       employees to execute our business plans. Our financial performance, along with       our Chapter 11 proceedings, created uncertainty that led to a significant       increase in unwanted attrition. Although unwanted attrition has slowed, we       remain at risk of losing additional management talent critical to the successful       transformation and ongoing operation of our business. If we experience a       substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, our performance       could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract       and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.
We       are facing significant litigation and if any such significant litigation is       concluded in a manner adverse to us, our financial condition and operating       results could be materially adversely affected.
We       are       involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters, employment       practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business.       As a       result of our Chapter11 filing, most attempts to collect, secure or       enforce remedies with respect to pre-petition claims against the company are       subject to the automatic stay       provisions of section362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and certain liabilities       could be discharged in the Chapter 11 proceedings. While we cannot reasonably       estimate the potential loss for certain of our legal proceedings because, for       example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify       damages being sought, if the outcome of any significant litigation is adverse       to       the company and such proceedings are not discharged in the Chapter 11       proceedings, our financial condition and operating results could be materially       adversely impacted.
We       are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving       our aircraft.
An       aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability.       The insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may       be       inadequate. In the event that the insurance is not adequate, we may       be       forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident       involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an       airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception       that our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation,       result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our       business. For a description of the Comair flight 5191 accident, see Legal       Proceedings - Comair Flight 5191 in Item 3.
Any       ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses       carryforwards.
Under       the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code), a       corporation is generally allowed a deduction in any taxable year for net       operating losses carried over from prior years. As of December 31, 2006, we       had       approximately $7.8 billion of federal and state net operating loss       carryforwards.
A       corporations use of its net operating loss carryforwards is generally limited       under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if a corporation undergoes an       ownership change. When an ownership change occurs pursuant to the       implementation of a plan of reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code, the       general limitation under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code may not apply       if certain requirements are satisfied under either section 382(l)(5) or section       382(l)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. We will experience an ownership change in connection withthe Plan, but we have not yet determined whether we will       be eligible for or rely on the special rule under section 382(l)(5) or the       special rule under section 382(l)(6). Assuming we rely on section 382(l)(5)       of       the Internal Revenue Code, a second ownership change within two years from the       effective date ofthe Planwould eliminate completely our ability to       utilize our net operating loss carryovers. Regardless of whether we rely on       section 382(l)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, an ownership change after the       effective date ofthe Plan could significantly limit our ability to utilize       our net operating loss carryforwards for taxable years including or following       such ownership change.
12 Transfer       restrictions on our stock issued in connection with the Plan may limit the       liquidity of our stock.
To       reduce       the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our net       operating loss carryovers, our new certificate of incorporation will contain       certain restrictions on the transfer of our stock issued in connection       withthe Plan. These transfer restrictions will be effective for two years       following the effective date of the Plan, subject to extension for an additional       three years. These transfer restrictions may adversely affect the ability of       certain holders of our stock to dispose of or acquire shares of our stock during       the period the restrictions are in place. Furthermore, while the purpose of       these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring       within the meaning of section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, no assurance       can       be given that such an ownership change will not occur.
Risk Factors       Relating to the Airline       Industry The       airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete       in       the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will       be       materially adversely affected.
We       face       significant competition with respect to routes, services and fares. Our domestic       routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers, some       of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to       destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant competition at       our       hub airports in Atlanta and JFK from other carriers. In addition, our operations       at our hub airports also compete with operations at the hubs of other airlines       that are located in close proximity to our hubs. For example, our hubs in       Atlanta, JFK, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City compete with, among others, U.S.       Airways hubs in Charlotte, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Phoenix, respectively.       We also face increasing competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from       rapidly expanding regional jet operators. In addition, we compete with foreign       carriers, both on interior U.S. routes, due to marketing and codesharing       arrangements, and in international markets.
The       continuing growth of low-cost carriers, including Southwest, AirTran and       JetBlue, in the United States has placed significant competitive pressure on       us       and other network carriers. In addition, other hub-and-spoke carriers such       as US       Airways and United Airlines reduced their costs through Chapter 11       reorganizations. Our ability to compete effectively with low-cost carriers,       restructured carriers and other airlines depends, in part, on our ability to       maintain a cost structure that is competitive with those carriers. If we cannot       maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial       condition and operating results could be materially adversely       affected.
The       airline industry has changed fundamentally since the terrorist attacks on       September 11, 2001, and our business, financial condition and operating results       have been materially adversely affected.
Since       the       terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the airline industry has experienced       fundamental and permanent changes, including substantial revenue declines and       cost increases, which have resulted in industry-wide liquidity issues. The       terrorist attacks significantly reduced the demand for air travel, and       additional terrorist activity involving the airline industry could have an       equal       or greater impact. Additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks, even       if       not made directly on the airline industry, negatively affect us and the airline       industry. Although global economic conditions have improved from their depressed       levels after September 11, 2001, the airline industry in the United States       experienced a prolonged reduction in business travel and increased price       sensitivity in customers purchasing behavior. In addition, aircraft fuel prices       have increased significantly during the last several years, were at historically       high levels for an extended period during 2005 and remained at or near those       levels during 2006. Industry capacity has remained high despite these       conditions. We expect that all of these conditions will persist.
The       airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new       regulations may increase our operating costs.
Airlines       are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that       result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues       directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation       of       aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue       incurring expenses to comply with the FAAs regulations.
13 Other       laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed       from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations       or       reduce revenues. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act,       which became law in November 2001, mandates the federalization of certain       airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on       airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on       passengers and a tax on airlines. The federal government has on several       occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax. Due to the       weak       revenue environment, the existing tax has negatively impacted our revenues       because we have generally not been able to increase our fares to pass these       fees       on to our customers. Similarly, the proposed ticket tax increase, if       implemented, could negatively impact our revenues.
Furthermore,       we and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding       privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries       in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding       privacy of passenger data in the United States, certain European government       agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices. Compliance       with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating       costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion.
Our       insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September 11       terrorist attacks, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in       coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating       results.
As       a       result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers       significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to       commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than employees or       passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events.       At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for       such coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001,       the U.S. government has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance       to       cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to passengers, third       parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coverage currently extends       through August 31, 2007. The withdrawal of government support of airline       war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage       commercially, if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially       less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the U.S. government,       may       not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism,       may       result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable       at all, resulting in an interruption to our operations.

These                 aircraft are included in the above table because we continue to have                 a                 contractual obligation to purchase these aircraft from the                 manufacturer.

See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements for information about an agreement we entered into in                 January                 2007 to purchase 30 CRJ-900 aircraft, with options to acquire an                 additional 30 aircraft.
15 Ground Facilities We       lease       most of the land and buildings that we occupy. Our largest aircraft maintenance       base, various computer, cargo, flight kitchen and training facilities and most       of our principal offices are located at or near the Atlanta Airport, on land       leased from the City of Atlanta generally under long-term leases. We own a       portion of our principal offices, our Atlanta reservations center and other       real       property in Atlanta.
We       lease       ticket counter and other terminal space, operating areas and air cargo       facilities in most of the airports that we serve. At most airports that we       serve, we have entered into use agreements which provide for the non-exclusive       use of runways, taxiways, and other improvements and facilities; landing fees       under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight       of aircraft. These leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less       than one year to thirty years or more, and often contain provisions for periodic       adjustments of lease rates, landing fees and other charges applicable under       that       type of agreement. Examples of major leases and use agreements at Delta hub       or       other significant airports that will expire in the next several years include,       among others: (1) Atlanta central passenger terminal lease and the airport       use       agreement, which expire in 2010; (2) Salt Lake City airport use and lease       agreement, which expires in 2008; and (3) LaGuardia terminal lease, which       expires in 2008. We also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo       facilities at certain airports, including, among others, our main Atlanta       maintenance base, Atlanta air cargo facilities and hangar and air cargo       facilities at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and Salt       Lake City International Airport. Our aircraft maintenance facility leases       generally require us to pay the cost of providing, operating and maintaining       such facilities, including, in some cases, amounts necessary to pay debt service       on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction. We also lease       marketing, ticket and reservations offices in certain locations for varying       terms. Additional information relating to our leases of our ground facilities       is       set forth in Note7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In       recent       years, some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged       to       airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable. The extent to which such       charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to       contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative       proceedings before the DOT. If the limitations on such charges are relaxed,       or       the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted,       the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially.
The       City       of Atlanta, with our support and the support of other airlines, is currently       implementing portions of a ten year capital improvement program (the CIP) at       the Atlanta Airport. Implementation of the CIP should increase the number of       flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays. The CIP       includes, among other things, a new approximately 9,000 foot full-service runway       that opened in May 2006, related airfield improvements, additional terminal       and       gate capacity, new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other       infrastructure improvements. If fully implemented, the CIP is currently       estimated by the City of Atlanta to cost approximately $6.8billion, which       exceeds the $5.4billion CIP approved by the airlines in 1999. The CIP runs       through 2010, with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different       times. A combination of federal grants, passenger facility charge revenues,       increased user rentals and fees, and other airport funds are expected to be       used       to pay CIP costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds.       Certain elements of the CIP have been delayed, and there is no assurance that       the CIP will be fully implemented. Failure to implement certain portions of       the       CIP in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at the Atlanta       Airport.
ITEM 3.
LEGAL         PROCEEDINGS Chapter11       Proceedings As       discussed above, on September14, 2005, we and certain of our subsidiaries       filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy       Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The reorganization cases are being jointly       administered under the caption In re Delta Air Lines, Inc., et al., Case       No.05-17923-ASH. The Debtors continue to operate their business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in       accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders       of       the Bankruptcy Court. As of the date of the Chapter 11 filing, then pending       litigation against the Debtors was generally stayed, and absent further order       of       the Bankruptcy Court, most parties may not take any action to recover on       pre-petition claims against the Debtors.
16 Delta       Family-Care Savings Plan Litigation On       March16, 2005, a retired Delta employee filed an amended class action       complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia       against Delta, certain current and former Delta officers and certain current       and       former Delta directors on behalf of himself and other participants in the Delta       Family-Care Savings Plan (Savings Plan). The amended complaint alleges that       the defendants were fiduciaries of the Savings Plan and, as such, breached       their       fiduciary duties under ERISA to the plaintiff class by (1)allowing class       members to direct their contributions under the Savings Plan to a fund invested       in Delta common stock; and (2)continuing to hold Deltas contributions to       the Savings Plan in Deltas common and preferred stock. The amended complaint       seeks damages unspecified in amount, but equal to the total loss of value in       the       participants accounts from September2000 through September2005 from       the investment in Delta stock. Defendants deny that there was any breach of       fiduciary duty, and have moved to dismiss the complaint. The District Court       stayed the action against Delta due to the bankruptcy filing and granted the       motion to dismiss filed by the individual defendants. The plaintiffs appealed       to       the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit the District Courts       decision to dismiss the complaint against the individual defendants but       voluntarily dismissed this appeal, pending resolution of the automatic stay       of       their claim against Delta.
Comair Flight       5191 On       August       27, 2006, Comair Flight 5191 crashed shortly after take-off in a field near       the       Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Kentucky. All 47 passengers and two members       of       the flight crew died in the accident. The third crew member survived with severe       injuries. Lawsuits arising out of this accident have been filed against Comair       on behalf of at least 36 passengers, including a number of lawsuits that also       name Delta as a defendant. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. These lawsuits,       which are in preliminary stages, generally assert claims for wrongful death       and       related personal injuries, and seek unspecified damages, including punitive       damages in most cases. All but four of the lawsuits filed to date have been       filed either in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky       or       in state court in Fayette County, Kentucky. The cases filed in state court       in       Kentucky have been or are expected to be removed to federal court. One lawsuit       has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New       York,       one lawsuit has been filed in state court in Broward County, Florida, and two       lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas.       The federal court in New York has ordered the case filed there to be transferred       to the federal court in Kentucky. Our motion is currently pending in federal       court in Florida to transfer the case filed in Florida to the federal court       in       Kentucky. We are also seeking to transfer the lawsuits filed in Kansas to the       federal court in Kentucky. Those matters pending in the Eastern District of       Kentucky have been consolidated as In Re Air Crash at Lexington, Kentucky,       August 27, 2006, Master File No. 5:06-CV-316.
In       addition, Comair has filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern       District of Kentucky against the United States (based on the actions of the       FAA), the Lexington Airport Board and certain other Lexington airport       defendants, seeking to apportion potential liability for damages arising from       this accident among all responsible parties.
We       carry       aviation risk liability insurance and believe that this insurance is sufficient       to cover any liability likely to arise from this accident.

MARKET                 FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER                 PURCHASES OF EQUITY                 SECURITIES Until       October13,2005, our common stock was traded on the New York Stock       Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol DAL. As the result of our bankruptcy       proceedings, our common stock was suspended from trading by the NYSE on       October13,2005 and thereafter delisted by the NYSE. Our common stock       is being quoted and, has been quoted since its suspension from the NYSE, on       the       Pink Sheets Electronic Quotation Service (Pink Sheets) maintained by Pink       Sheets LLC for the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. The tickler symbol DALRQ has been assigned to our common stock for over-the-counter       quotations.
The       following table sets forth for the periods indicated, the highest and lowest       sales price for our common stock, as reported on the NYSE for the period through       October13,2005 and the quarterly high and low bid quotations for our       common stock as reported on the Pink Sheets for the period beginning       October13,2005.

We       suspended the payment of dividends on our common stock in 2003. We expect to       retain any future earnings to fund our operations and meet our cash and       liquidity needs. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our       common stock for the foreseeable future.
Current       holders of Deltas common stock and other equity interests will not receive any       distributions under the Debtors proposed Plan. These equity interests would be       cancelled upon the effectiveness of the proposed Plan. Accordingly, we urge       that       caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in Deltas       equity securities and any of Deltas liabilities or other       securities.

20 ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENTS                 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF                 OPERATIONS Background On       September 14, 2005 (the Petition Date), we and substantially all of our       subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for       reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern       District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). The reorganization cases are       being jointly administered under the caption, In re Delta Air Lines, Inc., et       al., Case No. 05-17923-ASH.
The       Debtors are operating as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the       Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the       Bankruptcy Code. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are       authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business,       but       may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without       the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
Under       Section 365 and other relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume,       assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases,       including leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to       the       approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. Any description       of an executory contract or unexpired lease in this Form 10-K, including where       applicable our express termination rights or a quantification of our       obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any       overriding rejection rights we have under the Bankruptcy Code.
On       December 19, 2006, we filed with the Bankruptcy Court our Plan of Reorganization       and a related Disclosure Statement, which contemplate that Delta will emerge       from Chapter 11 as an independent airline. The Plan of Reorganization, as       amended (the Plan), addresses various subjects with respect tothe       Debtors, including the resolution of pre-petition obligations, as well       asthe capital structure and corporate governance after exit from Chapter       11.
The       Plan       provides that most holders of allowed unsecured claims against the       Debtorswill receive common stock of reorganized Delta in satisfaction of       their claims. Some holders of allowed unsecured claims against the Debtors       would       have the right to request cash proceeds of sales of common stock of reorganized       Delta in lieu of such stock, and certain others would receive cash in       satisfaction of their claims. Current holders of Deltas equity interests would       not receive any distributions, and their equity interests would be cancelled       once the Plan becomes effective.
On       February 7, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court approved the amended Disclosure       Statement, and authorized the Debtors to begin soliciting votes from creditors       to approve the Plan. The official committee of unsecured creditors (the Creditors Committee) and the two official retiree committees appointed in the       Debtors Chapter 11 proceedings each support the Plan. To be accepted by holders       of claims against the Debtors, the Plan must be approved by at least one-half       in       number and two-thirds in dollar amount of claims actually voting in each       impaired class.
April       9,       2007 is the deadline for creditors to vote on the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court       has       scheduled a confirmation hearing on April 25, 2007 to consider approval of       the       Plan. If the Plan is approved by the creditors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy       Court, the Debtors are planning to emerge from Chapter 11 shortly       thereafter.
For       additional information regarding the Debtors Chapter 11 proceedings, see       Note1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Overview of       2006 Results In       2006,       we recorded a net loss of $6.2 billion, which is primarily attributable to       a       $6.2 billion charge to reorganization items, net. Our 2006 financial results       also include a $765 million income tax benefit associated with the reversal       of       certain income tax valuation allowances and a $310 million noncash charge       associated with certain accounting adjustments. For additional information       about       these matters, see Results of Operations - 2006 Compared to 2005 and Basis of       Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements - Accounting Adjustments below.
21 From       an       operational perspective, we reported operating income of $58 million in 2006,       a       $2.1 billion improvement in operating results compared to 2005 and our first       annual operating profit since 2000. This improvement is due in large part to       revenue increases and cost reductions we have achieved during our Chapter 11       reorganization from revenue and network productivity improvements, in-court       restructuring initiatives and labor cost reductions.
During       2006, we also strengthened our liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents and       short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2006, compared       to       $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005.
Our Business       Plan Our       reorganization in Chapter 11 has involved a fundamental transformation of our       business. Shortly after the Petition Date, we outlined a business plan intended       to make Delta a simpler, more efficient and more customer focused airline with       an improved financial condition.
Restructuring       Business Plan As       part       of the Chapter 11 reorganization process, we were seeking $3.0 billion in annual       financial improvements by the end of 2007. As of December 31, 2006, we reached       that goal and these improvements are reflected in our Consolidated Financial       Statements for 2006. Weexpect we will achieve additional financial       improvements in 2007. The $3.0 billion in annual financial improvements under       our restructuring business plan is a result of (1) revenue and network       productivity improvements, (2) in-court restructuring initiatives and (3) labor       cost reductions. Some of our accomplishments in these areas are described       below.
Revenue       and Network Productivity Improvements.
Key       initiatives accomplished by the end of 2006 in the area of revenue and network       productivity improvements include:  simplifying                 our fleet, including retiring four aircraft                 types;  right-sizing                 capacity to better meet customer demand, including utilizing smaller                 aircraft in domestic operations, which reduced domestic mainline                 capacity                 by 16% in 2006 compared to 2005;  growing                 our international presence by shifting wide-body aircraft from domestic                 to                 international operations, which increased international capacity                 by 21% in                 2006 compared to 2005; and  increasing                 point-to-point flying and right-sizing and simplifying our domestic                 hubs                 to achieve a greater local traffic                 mix.
We       strengthened our domestic hubs and are continuing to increase international       service. For example, in 2006, we added more than 50 new daily flights to 20       cities in 18 countries in Europe and other countries such as India and Israel,       capitalizing on our international gateways at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta       International Airport, which is the worlds largest hub, and John F. Kennedy       International Airport in New York. In addition, we offermore than600       weekly flights to 58 destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean.
In-Court       Restructuring Initiatives.
Our       business planincludes annual cost reductions through in-court initiatives       such as debt restructurings, lease and facility restructurings, aircraft lease       renegotiations and rejections, vendor contract renegotiations and retiree       healthcare benefit modifications. Some of our accomplishments through the end       of       2006 include:  restructuring                 our fleet by rejecting, returning or selling approximately 188 aircraft;                 and 22  making                 cost-saving progress on many facility agreements, including a review                 of                 approximately 55 locations.
We                 have rejected or restructured leases at various airports, including                 Dallas, Orlando and Tampa.
Labor       Cost Reductions.
Our       business plan includes annual benefits through reduced employment costs. During       our Chapter 11 proceedings, by the end of 2006, we had:  reached                 an agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association, International                 (ALPA)                 under which we expect to receive approximately $280 million in average                 annual pilot labor cost savings between June 1, 2006 and December                 31, 2009                 from changes in pilot pay rates, benefits and work rules. This excludes                 savings we will achieve from the termination of the primary qualified                 defined benefit pension plan for pilots (Pilot Plan) and the related                 non-qualified plans;  implemented                 plans designed to achieve more than $600 million per year in non-pilot                 employment cost reductions. These cost reductions included charges                 to pay                 and benefits for non-pilot employees and staffing                 reductions;  reached                 agreements with committees representing our retired pilots and retired                 non-pilot employees that provide us with approximately $50 million                 in                 annual savings from changes to retiree healthcare benefit                 coverage;  advocated                 successfully for pension reform legislation, culminating in the Pension                 Protection Act. As a result, we intend to preserve our defined benefit                 pension plan for active and retired non-pilot                 employees;  reached                 agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC)                 regarding the termination of the Pilot Plan;                 and  implemented                 an enhanced profit-sharing plan that will allow employees to share                 in our                 future success.
Emergence       Business Plan As       a result of our reorganization, we expect to emerge from bankruptcy as a       competitive, standalone airline with a global network. We intend       to be the       airline of choice for customers by continuing to improve the customer experience       on the ground and in the air. Our business strategy touches all facets of our       operations - the destinations we will serve, the way we will serve our       customers, and the fleet we will operate - in order to earn customer preference       and continue to improve revenue performance. At the same time, we intend to       remain focused on maintaining the competitive cost structure we have obtained       from our reorganization to improve our financial position and pursue long-term       stability as a standalone carrier.
Important       aspects of our emergence business strategy include the following:  Leveraging                 Network Strength to Provide Expanded International Service.
We                 will continue to focus on international growth. With our                 geographically-balanced hubs, we believe we are well- positioned for international growth from the U.S. to Europe and Latin America.                 In                 addition, we expect our hubs will help us increase service to Africa                 and                 Asia.
Maintaining                 Focus on Improving the Customer Experience.
Our                 focus on safety will remain our top priority. We are also committed to continuous improvement                 throughout our operations to earn our customers preference. We have                 renewed our focus on improving our product and customer service through                 aircraft cabin and airport                 improvements.
Maximizing                 a Streamlined and Upgraded Fleet.
We                 are supporting the ongoing changes to our network by bolstering our                 internationally-capable mainline fleet. We plan to pursue additional                 strategic improvements to our fleet by adding high-performance aircraft                 that will enable us to serve new destinations with appropriate capacity.                 We have announced plans to add 28 internationally capable aircraft                 scheduled for delivery in 2007 through                 2009.
23  Capturing                 the Benefit of Competitive Cost Structure.
Through                 initiatives undertaken during the Chapter 11 proceedings and previous                 productivity initiatives, we currently have one of the lowest mainline                 unit cost structures of any full service carrier. These efforts have                 resulted in reduced costs throughout our organization, including                 reductions in employment costs, retiree pension and healthcare costs and aircraft fleet costs. We recognize that,                 to                 succeed, we must maintain the competitive unit cost structure that                 we                 developed through our restructuring efforts.
Generating                 Cash Flow from Operations Necessary to Fund Capital Expenditures                 and                 Reduce Debt.
Over an extended period following emergence from Chapter 11, we intend                 to                 balance long-term operating growth with overall credit improvement.                 At                 emergence from bankruptcy, we expect to                 have significantly reduced our total debt from pre-petition levels.                 Ongoing improvements to our financial condition are, however, necessary                 for us to withstand industry and economic volatility and to have                 favorable, consistent access to capital markets.
Unsolicited Merger       Proposal On       November 15, 2006, US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways) publicly announced an       unsolicited proposal to engage in a merger transaction with us (the US Airways       Proposal).
Under       the       original US Airways Proposal, the holders of unsecured claims in our bankruptcy       cases would have received $4.0 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares of US       Airways common stock. In addition, US Airways contemplated that our       debtor-in-possession financing agreements and all other allowed secured claims       and administrative claims in our bankruptcy cases would be assumed or paid       in       full. The US Airways Proposal was conditioned on satisfactory completion of       a       due diligence investigation on us, the Bankruptcy Courts approval of a mutually       agreeable plan of reorganization predicated upon a merger, regulatory approvals       and approval by the shareholders of US Airways.
On       December 15, 2006, our Board of Directors unanimously determined that the US       Airways Proposal was inadequate, presented unacceptably high risk that it could       not be consummated in the manner suggested by US Airways, was not in our best       interests or in the best interests of our creditors, as well as our other       stakeholders, and rejected the US Airways Proposal. The Board of Directors       also       determined that our interest and that of our creditors would be best served       if       we proceeded with filing the Plan, together with the Disclosure Statement,       with       the Bankruptcy Court. This decision by our Board of Directors was made after       careful consideration and extensive review and consultation with its legal       and       financial advisors.
On       January 10, 2007, US Airways increased its offer to merge with us and set forth       a revised proposal (the Revised US Airways Proposal) under which the holders       of our unsecured claims would have received $5.0 billion in cash and 89.5       million shares of US Airways common stock. US Airways said that the Revised       US       Airways Proposal would expire on February 1, 2007 unless, prior to that date,       there was affirmative creditor support for the commencement of due diligence,       the required filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act       had       been made and the hearing on the Disclosure Statement scheduled for February       7,       2007 had been adjourned.
On       January 31, 2007, the Creditors Committee announced support for our standalone       Plan of Reorganization. The Creditors Committee said that it had considered       various factors, including the risks associated with, and the likelihood of       a       successful consummation of, the Revised US Airways Proposal and the Plan in       reaching its conclusion in favor of the standalone Plan of Reorganization.       Following this announcement, US Airways withdrew its proposal.
Basis of       Presentation of Consolidated Financial       Statements Our       Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis       in       accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States       of       America (GAAP), including the provisions of American Institute of Certified       Public Accountants Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities       in Reorganization       Under the Bankruptcy Code (SOP 90-7). This contemplates the realization of       assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.       Accordingly, our Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any       adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of       liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going       concern.
24 Due       to       our Chapter 11 proceedings, the realization of assets and satisfaction of       liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership, are       subject to uncertainty.
Accordingly,       thereis substantial doubt about the current financial reporting entitys       ability to continue as a going concern. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we       expect to adopt fresh start reporting in accordance with SOP 90-7 which will       result in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting       purposes.The adoption of fresh start reporting may have a material       impact on theconsolidated financial statements of the new financial       reporting entity.
The       accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect or provide for       the       consequences of the Chapter 11 proceedings. In particular, the financial       statements do not show (1) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation       basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-petition       liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or       their status and priority; (3) as to shareowners equity accounts, the effect of       any changes that may be made in our capitalization; or (4) as to operations,       the       effect of any changes that may be made in our business.
Sale       of ASA On       September 7, 2005, we sold Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. (ASA), our wholly       owned subsidiary, to SkyWest, Inc. (SkyWest). After the sale, the revenue and       expenses related to our contract carrier agreement with ASA are reported as       regional affiliates passenger revenues and contract carrier arrangements,       respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to the sale,       expenses related to ASA were reported in the applicable expense line item in       our       Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 11 of the Notes to the       Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information on the sale of       ASA.
Accounting       Adjustments During       2006, we recorded certain out-of-period adjustments (Accounting Adjustments)       in our Consolidated Financial Statements that are reflected in our results       for       the year ended December 31, 2006. These adjustments resulted in an aggregate       net       noncash charge approximating $310 million to our Consolidated Statement of       Operations, consisting primarily of:  A                 $112 million charge in landing fees and other rents. This adjustment                 is                 associated primarily with our airport facility leases at John F.                 Kennedy                 International Airport in New York. It resulted from historical differences                 associated with recording escalating rent expense based on actual                 rent                 payments instead of on a straight-line basis over the lease term                 as                 required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 13,                 Accounting for Leases (SFAS                 13).
A                 $108 million net charge related to the sale of mileage credits under                 our                 SkyMiles frequent flyer program. This includes an $83 million decrease                 in                 passenger revenues, a $106 million decrease in other, net operating                 revenues, and an $81 million decrease in other operating expenses.                 This                 net charge primarily resulted from the reconsideration of our position                 with respect to the timing of recognizing revenue associated with                 the sale                 of mileage credits that we expect will never be redeemed for                 travel.
A                   $90 million charge in salaries and related costs to adjust our                   accrual for                   postemployment healthcare benefits. This adjustment is due to healthcare                   payments applied to                   this accrual over several years, which should have been expensed                   as                   incurred.
We       believe the Accounting Adjustments, considered individually and in the       aggregate, are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for each       of       the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In making this assessment,       we       considered qualitative and quantitative factors, including the substantial       net       loss in each of these three years, the noncash nature of the Accounting       Adjustments, our substantial shareowners deficit at the end of each of these       three years and our status as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the       Bankruptcy Code.
25 Results of       Operations  2006 Compared to       2005 Net       Loss Our       consolidated net loss was $6.2 billion in 2006 and $3.8 billion in 2005. The       net       loss for 2006 includes (1) a $6.2 billion charge to reorganization items, net       (see Reorganization Items, Net below), (2) $310 million of noncash charges       associated with certain accounting adjustments (see Accounting Adjustments above) and (3) a $765 million income tax benefit (see Income Tax Benefit below). As discussed below, the net loss for 2005 includes an $888 million       charge to restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related       items, net and an $884 million charge to reorganization items, net.
Operating       Revenue Year                 Ended December                 31, Increase (Decrease) %                 Increase (Decrease) (in                 millions) 2006 2005 Operating                 Revenue: Passenger: Mainline $ 11,773 $ 11,399 $ 374 3 % Regional                 affiliates 3,853 3,225 628 19 % Total                 passenger revenue 15,626 14,624 1,002 7 % Cargo 498 524 (26 ) (5) % Other,                 net 1,047 1,043 4 0 % Total                 operating revenue $ 17,171 $ 16,191 $ 980 6 % Operating       revenue totaled $17.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, a $980       million, or 6%, increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Passenger       revenue increased 7% while capacity decreased 6%. The increase in passenger       revenue is due to a rise of 10% and 13% in passenger mile yield and passenger       revenue per available seat mile (Passenger RASM), respectively, from fare       increases that reflect strong passenger demand as well as actions we have taken       since our Chapter 11 filing to achieve revenue and network productivity       improvements. Passenger revenue and other, net revenue were negatively impacted       by certain Accounting Adjustments discussed above. Passenger revenue of regional       affiliates increased due to (1) a change in how we classify ASAs revenues as a       result of its sale to SkyWest and (2) new contract carrier agreements with       Shuttle America Corporation (Shuttle America) and Freedom Airlines, Inc.       (Freedom), effective September 1, 2005 and October 1, 2005, respectively.
Year                 Ended Increase                 (Decrease) December                 31, 2006 Year                 Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 Passenger Passenger Passenger Load (in                 millions) Revenue Revenue RPMs Yield RASM Factor Passenger                 Revenue: North                 American passenger revenue $ 11,787 2% (10) % 14% 18% 2.8 International                 passenger revenue 3,719 24% 20 % 3% 2% (0.6 ) Charter                 revenue 120 2% (21) % 28% 12% (5.3 ) Total                 passenger revenue $ 15,626 7% (3) % 10% 13% 2.0 North       American Passenger Revenue.
North       American passenger revenue increased 2%, driven by a 14% increase in passenger       mile yield and a 2.8 point increase in load factor which were partially offset       by a 13% decline in capacity. Passenger RASM increased 18%. The decline in       capacity, partially offset by the increase in load factor, resulted in a 10%       decline in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), or traffic. The increases in       passenger revenue, passenger mile yield and Passenger RASM reflect (1) fare       increases implemented as part of the improved industry revenue environment       and       (2) the positive impact of our strategic initiatives, including right-sizing       capacity to better meet customer demand and increasing point-to-point flying       and       simplifying our domestic hubs to achieve a greater local traffic mix.
26 International       Passenger Revenue.
International       passenger revenue increased 24%, generated by a 20% increase in RPMs from a       21%       increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield and Passenger RASM increased       3%       and 2%, respectively. These results reflect increases in service to       international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets,       from the restructuring of our route network.

As discussed       below, the decrease in operating expense was primarily due to a decrease in       2006       in (1) salaries and related costs, (2) charges related to restructuring, asset       writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net, (3) aircraft rent and       (4) other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by (1) higher contract       carrier arrangements expense primarily due to a change in how we classify ASA       expense as a result of our sale of ASA on September 7, 2005, (2) certain       Accounting Adjustments discussed above and (3) an increase in aircraft fuel       prices.
Operating       capacity decreased 6% to 148 billion available seat miles primarily due to       the       reduction of our aircraft fleet as part of our business plan initiatives.       Operating cost per available seat mile decreased less than 1% to 11.56, because       the decrease in total operating expense discussed above was offset by the       reduction in operating capacity.
Aircraft       fuel.
Aircraft       fuel expense increased due to higher fuel prices despite reduced consumption.       Our average fuel price per gallon increased 19% to $2.04. Fuel gallons consumed       decreased 15% due to a reduction in Mainline capacity and our sale of ASA.       As a       result of this sale, ASAs fuel gallons are no longer part of our fuel gallons       consumed. Aircraft fuel expense includes fuel hedge losses of $108 million       in       2006.
Salaries       and related costs.
The       decrease in salaries and related costs primarily reflects a 12% decline due       to       lower Mainline headcount and our sale of ASA, and a 9% decrease from salary       rate       and benefit cost reductions for our pilot and non-pilot employees, partially       offset by certain Accounting Adjustments discussed above.
Contract       carrier arrangements.
Contract       carrier arrangements expense increased primarily due to (1) a 73% increase       from       the change in how we classify ASAs expenses as a result of its sale to SkyWest       and (2) an 18% increase from new contract carrier agreements with Shuttle       America and Freedom.
Landing       fees and other rents.
Landing       fees and other rents remained relatively constant because (1) a 4% decrease       from       the change in how we classify ASAs expenses as a result of its sale to SkyWest       and (2) a net 4% decrease due to our shifting of capacity from domestic to       international, were offset by certain Accounting Adjustments discussed       above.
27 Aircraft       rent.
The       decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to a 29% decrease from the       renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our       restructuring efforts and an 8% decrease from the change in how we classify       ASAs expenses as a result of its sale to SkyWest.
Restructuring,       asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net.
For       2006, restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items,       net totaled a $13 million charge, primarily due to the following:  Workforce                 Reduction.
A                 $29 million charge related to our decision in 2005 to reduce staffing                 by                 approximately 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by December 2007, which has been substantially completed. This charge was partially                 offset by a $21 million reduction in accruals associated with prior                 year                 workforce reduction programs.
For       2005,       restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net       totaled an $888 million charge consisting of the following:  Pension                 curtailment charge.
A                 $447 million curtailment charge related to the Pilot and Non-pilot Plans. This charge relates                 to                 the freeze of service accruals under the Pilot Plan effective December                 31,                 2004, and the impact of the planned reduction of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs                 announced in November 2004 on the Non-pilot Plan (see Note 10 of                 the Notes                 to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements).
Pension                 settlements.
$388 million in settlement charges primarily related to the Pilot Plan due to a significant increase in pilot                 retirements and lump sum distributions from plan assets (see Note                 10 of                 the Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements).
Workforce                 reduction.
A                 $46 million charge related to our decision in 2005 to reduce staffing                 by                 approximately 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by December 2007 ,                 which has been substantially completed. This charge was offset by                 a net $3                 million reduction in accruals associated with prior year workforce                 reduction programs.
Asset                 charges.
A                 $10 million charge related to the removal from service of six B-737-200 aircraft prior to their                 lease                 expiration dates.
Other.
The       decrease in other operating expense primarily reflects (1) a 12% decrease due       to       an adjustment related to certain nonincome tax reserves, (2) a 10% decrease       from       certain Accounting Adjustments discussed above and (3) an 8% decrease related       to       the change in how we classify ASAs expenses as a result of its sale to       SkyWest.
Operating       Income (Loss) and Operating Margin We       reported operating income of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,       compared to an operating loss of $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31,       2005. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating income (loss) to       operating revenues, was less than 1% and (12%) for 2006 and 2005,       respectively.
Other       (Expense) Income Other       expense, net for 2006 was $820 million, compared to $974 million for 2005.       This       change is substantially attributable to a 16%, or $162 million, decrease in       interest expense which was partially offset by a $19 million increase in       miscellaneous, net expense primarily associated with our fuel hedge positions.
The       reduction in interest expense is primarily attributable to a $206 million       decrease due to the accounting treatment of certain interest charges under       our       Chapter 11 proceedings in accordance with SOP 90-7 (see Note 2 of the Notes       to       the Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in interest expense was       partially offset by a $97 million increase from a higher level of debt       outstanding and higher interest rates.
28 The       increase in miscellaneous, net expense is primarily due to charges related       to       the ineffective portion of our fuel hedge positions accounted for in accordance       with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging       Activities. For additional information about our fuel hedge positions, see Note       2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reorganization       Items, Net Reorganization       items, net totaled a $6.2 billion charge for 2006, primarily consisting of       the       following:  Pilot                 pension termination.
$2.2 billion and $801 million allowed general, unsecured pre-petition                 claims in connection with our settlement agreements with the PBGC                 and a                 group representing retired pilots, respectively. Charges for these                 claims                 were offset by $1.3 billion in settlement gains associated with the                 derecognition of previously recorded Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified                 plan obligations upon each plans termination. For additional information                 regarding these settlement agreements and the termination of these                 plans,                 see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pilot                 collective bargaining agreement.
A                 $2.1 billion allowed general, unsecured pre-petition claim in connection                 with our comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing our pilot labor                 costs.                 For additional information regarding this agreement, see Note 1 of                 the                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements.
Aircraft                 financing renegotiations and rejections.
$1.7 billion of estimated claims associated with restructuring the                 financing arrangements for 188 aircraft and the rejection of                 16 aircraft leases.
Retiree                 healthcare benefit claims.
$539 million of allowed general, unsecured pre-petition claims in                 connection with agreements that we reached with committees representing both pilot and non-pilot retired employees reducing their postretirement                 healthcare benefits. For additional information regarding these                 agreements, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements.
Reorganization       items, net totaled an $884 million charge for 2005, primarily consisting of       the       following:  Aircraft                 financing renegotiations, rejections and repossessions.
A                 $611 million charge for estimated claims associated with restructuring                 the                 financing arrangements for seven aircraft, the rejection of 50 aircraft leases and the repossession                 of 15                 aircraft.
Debt                 issuance and discount costs.
A                 $163 million charge associated with the write-off of certain debt                 issuance                 costs anddiscounts in conjunction with the valuation of our                 unsecured and undersecured debt.
Facility                 leases.
An                 $88 million charge for estimated claims in connection with the rejection                 of certain unexpired facility leases and the related bond                 obligations.
Income       Tax Benefit For       2006,       we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $765 million. The amount primarily       reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the       reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the derecognition of       previously recorded Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified plan obligations upon       each plans termination.
For       2005,       we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $41 million. The amount is primarily       the result of a $1.6 billion adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation       allowance due to increases in the deferred tax asset related to our additional       minimum pension liability and net operating loss carryforwards.
For       additional information about the income tax valuation allowance, see Note 9       of       the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
29 Results of       Operations  2005 Compared to       2004 Net       Loss Our       consolidated net loss was $3.8 billion in 2005 and $5.2 billion in 2004. The       net       loss for 2005 includes an $888 million charge to restructuring, asset       writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net (see Restructuring,       asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net below) and an $884       million charge to reorganization items, net (see Reorganization Items, Net above). As discussed below, the net loss for 2004 includes a $1.9 billion       impairment of intangible assets related to the write-off of goodwill associated       with ASA and Comair and a $1.2 billion income tax provision primarily related       to       recording a valuation allowance for our deferred income tax assets.
Operating       Revenue Year                 Ended December                 31, Increase %                 Increase (in                 millions) 2005 2004 (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating                 Revenue: Passenger: Mainline $ 11,399 $ 10,880 $ 519 5 % Regional                 affiliates 3,225 2,910 315 11 % Total                 passenger revenue 14,624 13,790 834 6 % Cargo 524 500 24 5 % Other,                 net 1,043 945 98 10 % Total                 operating revenue $ 16,191 $ 15,235 $ 956 6 % Operating       revenue totaled $16.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a $956       million, or 6%, increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Passenger       revenue increased 6% on a 3% increase in capacity. The increase in passenger       revenue reflects a 6% rise in RPMs and a flat passenger mile yield. The       relatively constant passenger mile yield reflects our lack of pricing power       due       to the continuing growth of low-cost carriers with which we compete in most       of       our domestic markets, high industry capacity and price sensitivity by our       customers, enhanced by the availability of airline fare information on the       Internet. During the fourth quarter of 2005, passenger mile yield increased       8%       compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, which reflects a general improvement       in       the overall business environment and the structural changes we made to       strengthen our route network since our Chapter 11 filing.
Year                     Ended December 31, 2005 Increase                       (Decrease) Year                       Ended December 31, 2005 vs.                       2004 Passenger Passenger Passenger Load (in                 millions) Revenue Revenue RPMs Yield RASM Factor Passenger                 Revenue: North                 American passenger revenue $ 11,503 4 % 4 %  3 % 2.2 International                 passenger revenue 3,003 17 % 13 % 4 % 4 %  Charter                 revenue 118 (2) % (25) % 30 % 20 % (3.6 ) Total                 passenger revenue $ 14,624 6 % 6 %  3 % 1.8 North       American Passenger Revenue.
North       American passenger revenue increased 4% due to increased traffic in 2005. In       the       first half of 2005 yields averaged 5% below the first half of 2004, while in       the       second half of 2005 yields averaged 5% higher than the second half of       2004.
International       Passenger Revenue.
Higher       international passenger revenue reflects a capacity increase of 13%. RPMs also       increased 13%, while passenger mile yield increased 4%. Passenger RASM increased       4% to 8.45 and load factor remained consistent with the prior year. These       increases reflect increases in service to international destinations, primarily       in transatlantic markets.

Operating expense for 2004 totaled $18.5 billion, which includes a $1.9 billion       impairment of intangible assets related to the write-off of goodwill associated       with ASA and Comair. For additional information about this charge, see Note       5 of       the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating       capacity for 2005 increased 3% to 157 billion available seat miles, primarily       due to operational efficiencies from the redesign of our Atlanta hub from a       banked to a continuous hub, which allowed us to increase system-wide capacity       with no additional Mainline aircraft. Operating cost per available seat mile       decreased 5% to 11.60.
Salaries       and related costs.
The       decrease in salaries and related costs includes a 17% decrease from salary       rate       reductions for our pilot and non-pilot employees and a 7% decline due to lower       headcount.
Aircraft       fuel.
Aircraft       fuel expense increased $1.3 billion, or 46%, driven by higher fuel prices,       which       were slightly offset by a reduction in total gallons consumed due to our sale       of       ASA to SkyWest on September 7, 2005. Our average fuel price per gallon increased       47% to $1.71 while total gallons consumed decreased 1%. Fare increases       implemented during 2005 in response to rising aircraft fuel prices offset only       a       small portion of those cost increases. During 2005, we had no significant hedges       or contractual arrangements to reduce our fuel costs below market levels. Our       fuel expense is shown net of fuel hedge gains of $105 million in       2004.
Contract       carrier arrangements.
Contract       carrier arrangements expense increased primarily due to (1) a change in how       we       account for ASAs expenses as a result of its sale to SkyWest and (2) new       contract carrier agreements with Shuttle America and Freedom. These increases       were partially offset by the termination of our contract carrier arrangement       with Flyi, Inc. in 2004.
Aircraft       rent.
The       decrease in aircraft rent expense largely reflects a 21% decrease due to our       lease restructuring in the December 2004 quarter, which resulted in the       reclassification of certain aircraft leases from operating to capital. As       discussed below, this reclassification increased our interest expense. The       reduction in aircraft rent expense also reflects our rejection of the leases       for       50 aircraft, the renegotiation of the leases for seven aircraft and the       repossession of 15 aircraft in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings during       2005.
31 Restructuring,       asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net.
For       2005, restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items,       net totaled an $888 million charge consisting of the following:  Pension                 Curtailment Charge.
A                 $447 million curtailment charge related to our Pilot Plan and Non-pilot                 Plan. This charge relates to the freeze of service accruals under                 the                 Pilot Plan effective December 31, 2004 and the impact of the planned                 reduction of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs announced in November 2004 on the Non-pilot Plan (see                 Note 10                 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements).
Pension                 Settlements.
$388 million in settlement charges primarily related to the Pilot Plan due to a significant increase                 in pilot                 retirements and lump sum distributions from plan assets (see Note                 10 of                 the Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements).
Workforce                 Reduction.
A                 $46 million charge related to                 our decision in 2005 to reduce staffing by approximately 7,000 to                 9,000                 jobs by December 2007, which has been substantially completed. This                 charge                 was offset by a net $3 million reduction in accruals associated with                 prior                 year workforce reduction programs.
Asset                 Charges.
A                 $10 million charge related to                 the removal from service of six B-737-200 aircraft prior to their                 lease                 expiration dates.
For       2004,       restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net       totaled a $41 million gain consisting of the following:  Elimination                 of Retiree Healthcare Subsidy.
A                 $527 million gain related to our decision to eliminate the company                 provided healthcare coverage subsidy for employees who retire after January 1, 2006 (see Note 10 of the Notes to the                 Consolidated Financial Statements).
Pension                 Settlements.
$251 million in settlement charges related to the Pilot Plan due                 to a                 significant increase in pilot retirements and lump sum distribution                 from                 plan assets (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements).
Workforce                 Reduction.
A                 $194 million charge related to our decision to reduce staffing by                 approximately 6,000 to 7,000 jobs by December 2005. This charge included charges of $152 million related to special termination benefits and                 $42                 million related to employee severance (see Note 10 of the Notes to                 the                 Consolidated Financial Statements).
Asset                 Charges.
A                 $41 million aircraft impairment charge related to our agreement to                 sell                 eight owned MD-11 aircraft. In October 2004, we sold these aircraft and related inventory to a third party for $227                 million.
Other.
The       increase in other operating expense primarily reflects a 13% rise due to the       increase of incremental costs associated with our SkyMiles frequent flyer       program and a 5% increase from higher fuel taxes. These increases were partially       offset by the impact of our sale of ASA. For additional information regarding       our SkyMiles frequent flyer program, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated       Financial Statements.
Other       (Expense) Income Other       expenses, net for 2005 increased 42% to $974 million, compared to $684 million       for 2004. This change is substantially attributable to a 25%, or $208 million,       increase in interest expense in 2005 and a gain from sale of investments which       we recognized in 2004.
Interest       expense increased primarily due to a 31% increase from higher levels of debt       outstanding and higher interest rates as well as a 10% rise due to additional       interest related to the reclassification of certain aircraft leases from       operating leases to capital leases as a result of renegotiations during the       December 2004 quarter (see discussion of aircraft rent expense above). These       increases were offset by a 15% decrease due to the accounting treatment of       certain interest charges under our Chapter 11 proceedings in accordance with       SOP       90-7.
32 Gain       from       sale of investments was $123 million for 2004 primarily due to the sale of       our       remaining equity interest in Orbitz, Inc. For additional information about       this       sale, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial       Statements.
Reorganization       Items, Net Reorganization       items, net totaled an $884 million charge for 2005. See Results of       Operations - 2006 Compared to 2005 for additional information on these       items.
Income       Tax Benefit (Provision) In       2004,       we recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we       determined it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize       the       benefit of those tax assets. In 2005, we increased our valuation allowance       by       approximately $1.6 billion. For additional information about the income tax       valuation allowance, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial       Statements.
Financial Condition       and Liquidity During       our Chapter 11 proceedings, we entered into a number of agreements related       to       financing arrangements and settlements of pre-petition claims. For a description       of the arrangements that had an effect on our liquidity, see Notes 6 and 8       of       the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On       January 30, 2007, we secured commitments for a $2.5 billion exit financing       facility (Exit Facility) to be used in connection with our plan to exit       bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2007. For further information about the       Exit       Facility, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We       have       obligations under our agreement with ALPA and the PBGC Settlement Agreement       to       issue an aggregate of $875 million of new unsecured notes. For further       information about our agreement with ALPA and the PBGC Settlement Agreement,       see       Notes 1 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial       Statements.
Our       Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility and the Amex Post-Petition Facility       include certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants. We were in       compliance with these covenant requirements at December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Sources       and Uses of Cash We       expect       to meet our cash needs for 2007 from cash flows from operations, cash and cash       equivalents and short-term investments and financing arrangements. As discussed       in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have       obtained commitments for a $2.5 billion Exit Facility in connection with our       plan to exit bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2007.
Our       cash       and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.6 billion at December       31, 2006, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005. Restricted cash totaled       $802 million and $928 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.       Cash       and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006 and 2005 include $156 million and       $155       million, respectively, which is set aside for the payment of certain operational       taxes and fees to various governmental authorities.
Cash       flows from operating activities Cash       provided by operating activities was $993 million for the year ended December       31, 2006, an increase of $1.3 billionand $2.0 billion compared to the       years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by operating       activities in 2006 reflects an increase of $401 million and $2.0 billion in       working capital compared to 2005 and 2004, respectively. These increases are       primarily a result of revenue and network productivity       improvements, in-court restructuring initiatives and labor cost reductions       implemented in connection with our restructuring business plan during our       Chapter 11 proceedings and an improved revenue environment. For additional       information regarding our restructuring business plan and operational       performance, see Our Business Plan, Results of Operations - 2006       Compared to 2005, and Results of Operations  2005       Compared to 2004,  respectively.
33 Our       2006       cash flows from operating activities also includes a $116 million decrease       in       our restricted cash balanceprimarily due to a release of cash from       restricted to operating as a result of agreements we reached with certain       vendors. In 2005, our restricted cash balance increased significantly       primarily due to cash holdbacks associated with our Visa/MasterCard credit       card       processing agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we classified       changes to our restricted cash balances primarily associated with credit card       holdbacks to cash flows from operating activities to better reflect the nature       of restricted cash activities.Prior to 2006, we presented such       changes as an investing activity. For additional information regarding       thisreclassification, see Note 2 of the Notes to the       ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.
Cash       flows from investing activities Cash       used       in investing activities totaled $361 millionfor the year ended December       31, 2006,compared to cash provided by investing activities of $22 million       for the year ended December 31,2005. This change reflectsa $401       million decrease in cash used for the purchase of flight and ground equipment       in       2006.Our 2005 cash flows from investing activities also includes       $842 million in proceeds from our sale of ASA and certain flight       equipment.
Cashprovided       byinvesting activities totaled $22 million for the year ended December 31,       2005, compared to cash used in investing activities of $320 million for       the year ended December 31,2004. This change reflects $570 million of       flight equipment additions in 2005,including $417 million we paid to       purchase 11 B-737-800 aircraft that we sold to a third party immediately after       these aircraft were delivered to us by the manufacturer. Our 2005 cash flows       from investing activities also include $842 million in proceeds from our sale       of       ASA and certain flight equipment discussed above.
Cash       flows from financing activities Cash       used       in financing activities totaled $606 million for the year ended December 31,       2006, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $830 million for       the       year ended December 31, 2005. This change is primarily due to the net proceeds       we received under our Secured Super-Priority Debtor-In-Possession Credit       Agreement (the DIP Credit Facility) shortly after our Chapter 11 filing in       2005. As a result of our Chapter 11 filing, we ceased making payments on our       unsecured debt. For additional information regarding our Chapter 11 proceedings       and long-term debt, see Notes 1 and 6, respectively, of the Notes to the       Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash       provided by financing activities totaled $830 million and $636 million for       the       years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This change is primarily       attributable to the net proceeds we received under our DIP Credit Facility       as       discussed above compared to the net proceeds we received in 2004 in connection       with newly entered or amended financing arrangements in the aggregate amount       of       $1.8 billion and the issuance of 2  %       Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 in the amount of $325 million. As discussed       above, after filing for bankruptcy, we ceased making payments on our unsecured       debt.
Contractual       Obligations The       following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006       that relate to debt; operating leases; aircraft order commitments; capital       leases; contract carrier obligations; other material, noncancelable purchase       obligations; and other liabilities. We are in the process of evaluating our       executory contracts in order to determine which contracts will be assumed in       our       Chapter 11 proceedings. Therefore, obligations as currently quantified in the       table below and in the text immediately following the footnotes to the table       will continue to change. The table below does not include contracts that we       have       successfully rejected through our Chapter 11 proceedings. The table also does       not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that       are       uncertain or unknown at this time, some of which are discussed in footnotes       to       this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes.
34 Contractual                 Obligations by Year (in                 millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Total Long-term                 debt, not including liabilities subject to compromise (1)(2) $ 1,466 $ 2,152 $ 392 $ 1,300 $ 1,307 $ 1,071 $ 7,688 Long-term                 debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise (1) 453 640 868 177 103 2,704 4,945 Operating                 lease payments (3)(4) 1,257 1,182 977 915 792 4,915 10,038 Aircraft                 order commitments (5) 523 823 960 712   3,018 Capital                 lease obligations not subject to compromise (3)(6) 104 100 99 99 94 94 590 Capital                 lease obligations subject to compromise (3)(6) 6 3     9 Contract                 carrier obligations (7) 2,167 2,272 2,344 2,281 2,242 17,930 29,236 Other                 purchase obligations (8) 212 51 46 28 25 5 367 Other                 liabilities (9) 45      45 Total (10) $ 6,233 $ 7,223 $ 5,686 $ 5,512 $ 4,563 $ 26,719 $ 55,936 (1) These                 amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest                 on                 long-term debt is not included in the table above. For additional                 information about our debt and related matters, see Note 6 of the                 Notes to                 the Consolidated Financial                 Statements.
(2) Under                 our comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing our pilot labor costs,                 we                 are required to issue for the benefit of pilots, no later than 120                 days                 following our emergence from bankruptcy, senior unsecured notes (Pilot                 Notes) with an aggregate principal amount of $650 million, a term of up                 to 15 years and an annual interest rate calculated to ensure the                 Pilot                 Notes trade at par on the issuance date. The Pilot Notes are                 pre-payableat any time at our option, and we may replace all or a                 portion of the principal amount of the Pilot Notes with cash prior                 to                 their issuance.
Under       our       settlement agreement with the PBGC relating to the termination of the Pilot       Plan, we are required to issue to the PBGC, no later than seven business days       after our emergence from bankruptcy, senior unsecured notes (PBGC Notes) with       an aggregate principal amount of $225 million, a term of up to 15 years and       an       annual interest rate calculated to ensure the PBGC Notes trade at par on the       issuance date. We may replace all or a portion of the principal amount of the       PBGC Notes with cash prior to their issuance, which we are required to do under       certain circumstances.
The       Pilot       Notes and the PBGC Notes are not included in the table above.
(3) Although                 we are not generally permitted to make any payments on pre-petition                 obligations as a result of our Chapter 11 proceedings, we have reached                 agreements with certain aircraft financing parties under Section                 1110 of                 the Bankruptcy Code and received approval from the Bankruptcy Court                 to                 continue to make payments on certain aircraft debt and lease obligations.                 The amounts included remain subject to change until a plan of                 reorganization is approved and we emerge from Chapter                 11.
(4) This                 amount includes our noncancelable operating leases and our lease                 payments                 related to aircraft under our contract carrier agreements with ASA,                 SkyWest Airlines, Freedom and Shuttle America. Emerging Issues Task                 Force                 01-08, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, provides                 guidance on whether an arrangement contains a lease within the scope                 of                 SFAS 13 and is applicable to agreements entered into or modified                 after                 June 30, 2003. Because we entered into our contract carrier agreement                 with                 Chautauqua prior to June 30, 2003, payments totaling $183 million                 related                 to Chautauqua aircraft are not included in the table. See Note 7                 of the                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
We       have       signed a letter of intent with a third party to lease 10 B-757-200ER aircraft.       These aircraft will be delivered from July 2007 through November 2007 and will       be leased for seven years and three months each. We have also signed a letter       of       intent with a separate third party to lease three B-757-200ER aircraft which       would be delivered to us in the first quarter of 2008, or such earlier dates       as       the parties may agree and will be leased for five years. These aircraft leases       are not included in the table above.
(5) Our                 aircraft order commitments as of December 31, 2006 consist of firm                 orders                 to purchase five B-777-200LR aircraft, 10 B-737-700 aircraft and                 50                 B-737-800 aircraft, including 48 B-737-800 aircraft, which we have                 entered                 into definitive agreements to sell to third parties immediately following                 delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer starting in                 2007. The                 impact of these sales on the future commitments above would be a                 total                 reduction of approximately $2.0 billion during the period 2007 through                 2010.
35 On       January       31, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire 30 CRJ-900 aircraft from       Bombardier Inc., with options to acquire an additional 30 CRJ-900 aircraft.       The       aircraft will be delivered in two-class, 76 seat configuration between September       2007 and February 2010. We expect these aircraft will be operated by regional       air carriers under contract carrier agreements, and the purchase agreement       permits assignment of the aircraft and related support provisions to other       carriers. We have available to us long-term, secured financing commitments       to       fund a substantial portion of the aircraft purchase price for the 30 firm       orders.These aircraft order commitments are not included in the table       above.
(6) Interest                 payments related to capital lease obligations are included in the                 table.                 The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included                 on                 our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information about                 our                 capital lease obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated                 Financial Statements.
(7) This                 amount represents our minimum fixed obligation under our contract                 carrier                 agreements with Chautauqua, Shuttle America, ASA, SkyWest Airlines,                 and                 Freedom (excluding contract carrier lease payments accounted for                 as                 operating leases, (see footnote (4) above)). For additional information                 regarding our contract carrier agreements, see Note 8 of the Notes                 to the                 Consolidated Financial Statements.
(8) Includes                 purchase obligations pursuant to which we are required to make minimum                 payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance,                 outsourced human resource services, marketing, maintenance, obligations                 related to Comair, technology, and other third party services and                 products. For additional information about other commitments and                 contingencies, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial                 Statements.
(9) Represents                 other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we                 are                 obligated to make future payments related to medical benefit costs                 incurred but not yet paid. These liabilities are not included in                 any other                 line item on this table.
(10) In                 addition to the contractual obligations included in the table, we                 have                 significant cash obligations that are not included in the table.                 For                 example, we will pay wages required under collective bargaining                 agreements; fund pension plans (as discussed below); purchase capacity                 under contract carrier arrangements (as discussed below); and pay                 credit                 card processing fees and fees for other goods and services, including                 those related to fuel, maintenance and commissions. While we are                 parties                 to legally binding contracts regarding these goods and services,                 the                 actual commitment is contingent on certain factors such as volume                 and/or                 variable rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Therefore,                 these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase                 orders                 made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table                 and                 any amounts which we are liable for under the purchase orders are                 included                 in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance                 Sheets.
The       following items are not included in the table above: Pension       Plans.
We       sponsor qualified defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for       eligible employees and retirees. Our funding obligations for these plans are       governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).       Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual       funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions,       including those described below.
Defined       Contribution Pension Plans (DC Plans).
During       the year ended December 31, 2006, we contributed approximately $110 million       to       our DC Plans. Estimates of future funding requirements under our DC Plans are       not reasonably estimable at this time. Under our comprehensive agreement       with ALPA reducing our pilot labor costs, ALPA received, among other things,       a       $2.1 billion allowed general, unsecured pre-petition claim in our bankruptcy       proceedings. The proceeds of this claim will be distributed to pilot accounts       under the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan to the extent permitted by the Internal       Revenue Code, thereby reducing the amount we can contribute under the Internal       Revenue Code to the DC Plan for pilots in 2007. In addition, we intend to       implement changes to our DC Plan for non-pilot employees following our exit       from       bankruptcy but the design of these plan changes has not yet been       finalized.
Defined       Benefit Pension Plans (DB Plans) .       During       the year ended December 31, 2006, we contributed approximately $4 million to       our       DB Plans. Under our settlement agreement with the PBGC, the Pilot Plan was       terminated effective September 2, 2006, and we agreed to initiate, prior to       our       emergence from Chapter 11, a standard termination of a separate frozen qualified       defined benefit pension plan for certain pilots formerly employed by Western       Air       Lines. In addition, our non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for pilots       were terminated effective September 2, 2006.
Effective       December 31, 2005, future pay and service accruals under the Non-pilot Plan       were       frozen. The Pension Preservation Act of 2006 allows us to reduce the funding       obligations for the Non-pilot Plan over the next several years. As a result       of       this legislation, we intend to maintain the Non-pilot Plan. While this       legislation makes our funding obligations for the Non-pilot Plan more       predictable, factors outside our control will continue to have an impact on       the       funding requirements for that plan.
36 Estimates       of future funding requirements for the Non-pilot Plan are based on various       assumptions, including legislative changes regarding these obligations. These       assumptions also include, among other things, the actual and projected market       performance of assets of the Non-pilot Plan; statutory requirements; the terms       of the Non-pilot Plan; and demographic data for participants in the Non-pilot       Plan, including the number of participants and the rate of participant       attrition.
Assuming       current funding rules and current plan design, we estimate that the funding       requirements under the Non-pilot Plan for 2007, 2008 and 2009 will aggregate       approximately $300 million.
Contract       Carriers.
We have       long-term contract carrier agreements with the following five regional air       carriers (in addition to Comair): Chautauqua, Shuttle America, ASA, SkyWest       Airlines, and Freedom. Under these agreements, the carriers operate some or       all       of their aircraft using our flight code, and we schedule those aircraft, sell       the seats on those flights and retain the related revenues. We pay those       airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based       on a       determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors       intended to approximate market rates for those services.
Under       these long-term contract carrier agreements, we are obligated to pay certain       minimum fixed obligations, which are included in the table above. The remaining       estimated expenses are not included in the table because these expenses are       contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier       flights by those air carriers as well as rates that are unknown at this time.       We       cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expenses under the contract carrier       agreements in 2007 and thereafter.
We       may       terminate the Chautauqua and Shuttle America agreements without cause at any       time after May 2010 and January 2013, respectively, by providing certain advance       notice. If we terminate either the Chautauqua or Shuttle America agreements       without cause, Chautauqua or Shuttle America, respectively, has the right to       (1)       assign to us leased aircraft that the airline operates for us, provided we       are       able to continue the leases on the same terms the airline had prior to the       assignment and (2) require us to purchase or lease any of the aircraft that       the       airline owns and operates for us at the time of the termination. If we are       required to purchase aircraft owned by Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the       purchase price would be equal to the amount necessary to (1) reimburse       Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the equity it provided to purchase the       aircraft and (2) repay in full any debt outstanding at such time that is not       being assumed in connection with such purchase. If we are required to lease       aircraft owned by Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the lease would have (1) a       rate       equal to the debt payments of Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the debt       financing of the aircraft calculated as if 90% of the aircraft was debt financed       by Chautauqua or Shuttle America and (2) other specified terms and       conditions.
We       estimate that the total fair values, determined as of December 31, 2006, of       the       aircraft that Chautauqua or Shuttle America could assign to us or require that       we purchase if we terminate without cause our contract carrier agreements with       those airlines (the  Put Right  )       are $483 million       and $367 million, respectively. The actual amount that we may be required to       pay       inthese circumstances may be materially different from these       estimates. If the Chautaquaor Shuttle America Put Right is       exercised, we must also pay to the exercising carrier 10% interest (compounded       monthly) on the equity the carrier provided when it purchased the put       aircraft. These equity amounts for Chautauqua and Shuttle America total       $56 million and $34 million, respectively.
For       additional information on contract carrier agreements see Note 8 of the Notes       to       the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest       and Related Payments.
Estimated amounts for future interest and related payments in connection with       our long-term debt obligations are based on the fixed and variable interest       rates specified in the associated debt agreements. We expect to pay $643 million       related to interest on our fixed and variable ratelong-term debt not       subject to compromise in 2007. Estimates on variable rate interest were       calculated using implied short-term LIBOR based on LIBOR at December 31, 2006.       The related payments represent credit enhancements required in conjunction       with       certain financing agreements. As a result of our Chapter 11 filing, actual       interest expense in 2007 is expected to be less than the contractual interest       expense. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for       information about our policy relating to interest expense.
37 Legal       Contingencies.
We are       involved in various legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters, employment       practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business.       We       cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings       because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff       does not specify the damages being sought. As a result of our Chapter 11       proceedings, virtually all pre-petition pending litigation against us is stayed       and related amounts accrued have been classified in liabilities subject to       compromise on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006 and       2005.
Other       Contingent Obligations under Contracts.
In       addition to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have certain       contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire       inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined       by       each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior       to       its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our termination       of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would       exist unless such a termination occurs. We also cannot predict the impact,       if       any, that our Chapter 11 proceedings might have on these       obligations.
For       additional information about other contingencies not discussed above as well       as       discussions related to general indemnifications, see Note 8 of the Notes to       the       Consolidated Financial Statements.
Application of       Critical Accounting       Policies Critical       Accounting Estimates The       preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management       to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these       estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes       in       the business environment and other factors that management believes to be       reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from       these estimates.
Claims       Resolution Process.
As of       February 7, 2007, claims totaling about $87.0 billion have been filed with       the       Bankruptcy Court against the Debtors, and we expect new and amended claims       to be       filed in the future, including claims amended to assign values to claims       originally filed with no designated value. We have identified, and we expect       to       continue to identify, many claims that we believe should be disallowed by the       Bankruptcy Court because they are duplicative, have been later amended or       superseded, are without merit, are overstated or for other reasons. As of       February 7, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court has disallowed approximately $1.2 billion       of claims and has not yet ruled on our other objections to claims, the disputed       portions of which aggregate to an additional $2.8 billion. We expect to continue       to file objections in the future. Because the process of analyzing and objecting       to claims is ongoing, the amount of disallowed claims may increase significantly       in the future.
Through       the claims resolution process, differences in amounts scheduled by the Debtors       and claims filed by creditors will be investigated and resolved, including       through the filing of objections with the Bankruptcy Court where appropriate.       In       light of the substantial number and amount of claims filed, the claims       resolution process may take considerable time to complete, and we expect that       it       will continue after our emergence from Chapter 11. Accordingly, the ultimate       number and amount of allowed claims is not presently known, nor is the exact       recovery with respect to allowed claims presently known.
Passenger       Revenue.
We       record sales of passenger tickets as air traffic liabilities on our Consolidated       Balance Sheets. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation       or when the ticket expires unused, reducing the related air traffic liability.       We periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and record any       resulting adjustments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period       in which the evaluations are completed. These adjustments relate primarily       to       refunds, exchanges, transactions with other airlines and other items for which       final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets       at amounts other than the original sales price.
Frequent       Flyer Program.
We have       a frequent flyer program, the SkyMiles Program, offering incentives to increase       travel on Delta. This program allows participants to earn mileage for travel       awards by flying on Delta, Delta Connection carriers and participating airlines,       as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels       and car rental agencies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded       air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Crown       Room       Club and for other program awards.
38 For       SkyMiles accounts with sufficient mileage credits to qualify for a free travel       award, we record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards       that are earned and expected to be redeemed for travel on Delta or other       airlines. Our incremental costs include our system average cost per passenger       for fuel, food and other direct passenger costs for awards to be redeemed on       Delta. These estimates are generally updated based on our 12-month historical       average for such costs. We also accrue a frequent flyer liability for the       mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating       airlines based on historical usage patterns and contractual rates. We       periodically record adjustments to this liability in other operating expenses       on       our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on awards earned, awards       redeemed, changes in our estimated incremental costs and changes to the SkyMiles       program. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the       liability in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. The       liability is recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance       Sheets.
At       December 31, 2006 and 2005, we estimated that approximately eight million and       seven million free travel awards, respectively, were expected to be redeemed       for       free travel on Delta or other airlines. This estimate excludes mileage credits       in SkyMiles accounts which (1) do not have sufficient mileage credits to qualify       for a free travel award or (2) have sufficient mileage credits to qualify for       a       free travel award but which are not expected to be redeemed for such an       award.
We       sell       mileage credits in our SkyMiles frequent flyer program to participating       companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. The       portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates the       fair value of travel to be provided is deferred and recognized as passenger       revenue over the period when transportation is expected to be provided. Amounts       received in excess of the transportations fair value are recognized in income       currently and classified as other revenue. A change in assumptions as to the       period over which the mileage credits are expected to be used (currently 15       to       41 months), the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate       of the fair value of transportation expected to be provided could have a       material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in       future years.
Our       total       liability for future SkyMiles award redemptions for free travel on us or       participating airlines as well as unrecognized revenue from selling SkyMiles       mileage credits was approximately $887 million and $607 million at December       31,       2006 and 2005, respectively. These amounts were recorded as components of other       accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Long-Lived       Assets.
Our       flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $13.0       billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006. This value       is       based on various factors, including the assets estimated useful lives and their       estimated salvage values. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the       Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144), we record impairment       losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances       indicate the assets might be impaired and the estimated future cash flows       generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. The impairment       loss recognized is the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its       estimated fair value.
In       order       to evaluate potential impairment as required by SFAS 144, we group assets at       the       fleet type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows)       and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger yield,       fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. We estimate aircraft fair       values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties,       as available. For additional information about our accounting policy for the       impairment of long-lived assets, see Notes 2 and 5 of the Notes to the       Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income       Tax Valuation Allowance and Contingencies.
In       accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109),       deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more       likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not       be       realized. The future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on       the       availability of sufficient future taxable income. In making this determination,       we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain       assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities;       the       overall business environment; our historical earnings and losses; our industrys       historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses; and our outlook for future       years.
39 Our       income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject       to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.       Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns       are       reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that       various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which       could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the       reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that       affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of       limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current       calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance,       or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We adjust       the       income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the       revision become known.
For       additional information about income taxes, see Notes 2 and 9 of the Notes to       the       Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension       Plans.
We       sponsor DB Plans for our eligible employees and retirees. The impact of these       DB       Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2006 and       2005       and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 is presented in Note       10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Assuming current       plan       design, we currently estimate that our defined benefit pension plan expense       in       2007 will be approximately $100 million. The effect of our DB Plans on our       Consolidated Financial Statements is subject to many assumptions. We believe       the       most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average discount rate and (2)       the       expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans. The Pilot       Plan       and pilot non-qualified defined benefit pension plans were terminated during       2006. For additional information regarding these terminations, see Note 10       of       the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We       determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily       by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments       and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit       payments. We used a weighted average discount rate of 5.88% and 5.69% at       September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, our weighted average       discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years       has       varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 6.09% in       2004 to 5.67% in 2006, due to remeasurements throughout the year. The impact       of       a 0.50% change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table       below.
The       expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans is based       primarily on specific asset investment studies for our DB Plans performed by       outside consultants who used historical returns on our DB Plans assets. The       investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix       of       global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income       portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn       a       long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target.       Our historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets is       approximately 9% as of December 31, 2006. The impact of a 0.50% change in our       expected long-term rate of return is shown in the table below.
Change                 in Assumption Effect                 on 2007 Pension                 Expense Effect                 on Accrued Pension                 Liability at December                 31, 2006 0.50%                 decrease in discount rate +$15                 million +$475                 million 0.50%                 increase in discount rate -$15                 million -$475                 million 0.50%                 decrease in expected return on assets +$20                 million  0.50%                 increase in expected return on assets -$20                 million  Our       rate       of change in future compensation levels is based primarily on labor contracts       with our employees under collective bargaining agreements and expected future       pay rate changes for other employees. Due to the freeze of benefit accruals       effective December 31, 2005 in our Non-pilot Plan, adjusting the rate of change       in future compensation levels does not have an impact on 2007 pension expense       or       on the accrued pension liability at December 31, 2006.
For       additional information about our pension plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to       the       Consolidated Financial Statements.
40 Recently       Issued Accounting Pronouncements In       September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS       No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other       Postretirement Plans, an amendment of SFAS Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS       158). This statement, among other things, requires that we recognize the funded       status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in our       Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006, with changes in the funded       status recognized through comprehensive loss in the year in which such changes       occur. Application of this standard resulted in (1) a $685 million net decrease       in accrued pension and other postretirement and postemployment liabilities,       (2)       a $248 million decrease in the intangible pension asset in other noncurrent       assets and (3) a $437 milliondecrease in shareowners deficit. The       adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on our Consolidated Statement of Operations       for any period presented. For additional information related to the adoption       of       SFAS 158, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial       Statements.
In       July       2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in       Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), which       clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as       defined. FIN 48 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice associated       with       certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for       income taxes. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after       December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying this interpretation must       be       reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of shareowners deficit in       2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our Consolidated       Financial Statements and anticipate the adjustment to shareowners deficit will       not be material.
In       December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based       Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires an entity to recognize compensation       expense in an amount equal to the fair value of its share based payments, such       as stock options granted to employees. This standard replaces SFAS No. 123,       Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), and supersedes APB       Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We adopted SFAS 123R       on January 1, 2006. For additional information regarding SFAS 123R, see Note       2       in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement.
Market Risks       Associated with Financial       Instruments We       have       significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest       rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these       prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. To manage the       volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into derivative       transactions pursuant to stated policies (see Note 4 of the Notes to the       Consolidated Financial Statements). We expect adjustments to the fair value       of       financial instruments accounted for under SFAS 133 to result in ongoing       volatility in earnings and shareowners deficit.
The       following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand       for air travel, the economy as a whole, or actions we may take to seek to       mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other reasons, the       actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from       the following hypothetical results.
Aircraft       Fuel Price Risk Our       results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in the price of       aircraft fuel. To manage this risk, we periodically enter into derivative       contracts comprised of heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts,       to       hedge a portion of our projectedaircraft fuel requirements. We do not       enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes.
In       2006,       aircraft fuel expense accounted for 25% of our total operating expenses.       Aircraft fuel expense for 2006 increased 1% compared to 2005 due to higher       fuel       prices, despite reduced consumption. Our average fuel price per gallon increased       19% to $2.04, while total gallons consumed decreased 15%, due to a reduction       in       Mainline capacity and our sale of ASA.
41 As       of       December 31, 2006, we had hedged 36% of our projected fuel requirements for       the       March 2007 quarter using heating oil and jet fuel zero-cost collar contracts       with a weighted average contract cap and floor price of $1.93 and $1.82,       respectively. We recognized a $17 million loss from the settlement of certain       of       these contracts at January 31, 2007. During January 2007, we hedged       approximately 24% of our projected fuel requirements for the nine months ending       September 30, 2007 using heating oil and jet fuel zero-cost collar and swap       contracts. The swap contracts have a weighted average contract price of $1.58       and the zero-cost collar contracts have a weighted average contract cap and       floor price of $1.83 and $1.67, respectively. As of January 31, 2007, our open       fuel hedge contracts had an estimated fair market value gain of $2 million.       We       have not entered into any hedges for the December 2007 quarter. We estimate       that       a 10% rise in the price per gallon of heating oil and jet fuel would change       the       estimated fair market value associated with our outstanding contracts at       settlement to a $41 million gain.
We       project that our aircraft fuel consumption will be 2.6billion gallons in       2007. Based on a projected average jet fuel price of $2.00 per gallon for 2007,       a 10% rise in jet fuel prices would increase our aircraft fuel expense by $487       million, inclusive of the impact of effective hedge instruments that have       settled or are outstanding as of January 31, 2007.
We       did       not have any fuel hedge contracts outstanding as of December 31,       2005.

Interest       Rate Risk Our       exposure to market risk from volatility in interest rates is primarily       associated with our long-term debt obligations. Market risk associated with       our       fixed and variable rate long-term debt relates to the potential reduction in       fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an       increase in interest rates. The following sensitivity analysis for long-term       debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 excludeslong-term debt subject to       compromise due to our status as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11. At       December 31, 2006 and 2005, a 10% increase in average annual interest rates       would have decreased the estimated fair value of our long-termdebt not       subject to compromise by $114 million and $78 million, respectively, and       increase interest expense by $24 million and $19 million, respectively. At       December 31, 2006 and 2005, we did not have any interest rate swaps or       contractual arrangements that would reduce our interest expense. For additional       information on our long-term debt agreements, see Note 6 of the Notes to the       Consolidated Financial Statements.
While       operating as a debtor-in-possession, in accordance with SOP 90-7, we record       interest expense only to the extent (1) interest will be paid during our Chapter       11 proceeding or (2) it is probable interest will be an allowed priority,       secured, or unsecured claim. Interest expense recorded on our Consolidated       Statements of Operations totaled $870 million for 2006. Contractual interest       expense (including interest expense that is associated with obligations       classified as liabilities subject to compromise) totaled $1.2 billion for       2006.

ITEM               9A.
CONTROLS                 AND PROCEDURES Disclosure       Controls and Procedures Our       management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,       performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which have been designed to permit us to effectively identify and       timely disclose important information. Our management, including our Chief       Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the controls       and       procedures were effective as of December 31, 2006 to ensure that material       information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our       Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow       timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes       In Internal Control During       the three months ended December 31, 2006, we did not make any changes in our       internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or       are       reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial       reporting.
Managements       Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management       is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over       financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(f) and       15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over       financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the       reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements       for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally       accepted in the United States of America.
Because       of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may       not       prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness       to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate       because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the       policies may deteriorate.
43 Management       conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over       financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 using the criteria issued by the       Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in       Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, management       believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as       of       December31, 2006.
Management's       assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting       as of December31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an       independent registered public accounting firm, which also audited our       Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. Ernst       & Young LLPs report on managements assessment of internal control over       financial reporting is set forth below.
Report       of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To       the       Board of Directors and Shareowners of Delta       Air       Lines, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession) We       have       audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements       Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Delta Air       Lines, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession) (the Company) maintained effective internal       control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria       established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of       Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The       Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control       over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal       control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion       on       managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys       internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We       conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we       plan       and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective       internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material       respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control       over       financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating       the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing       such       other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe       that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A       companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to       provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting       and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance       with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over       financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain       to       the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly       reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)       provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to       permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are       being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors       of       the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely       detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys       assets that could have a material effect on the financial       statements.
Because       of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may       not       prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of       effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become       inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance       with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In       our       opinion, managements assessment that Delta       Air       Lines, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December       31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO       criteria. Also, in our opinion, Delta       Air       Lines, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial       reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the       COSO       criteria .
We       also       have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting       Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Delta       Air       Lines, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession) as of December 31, 2006, and the related       consolidated statements of operations, shareowners deficit, and cash flows in       the year ended December 31, 2006. O ur       report       datedMarch 1, 2007 expressed       an unqualified opinion thereon and included explanatory       paragraphs related to (i) the Companys ability to continue as a going concern       and (ii) changes in accounting for postretirement benefit plans and share-based       compensation.

49 INDEX TO       CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report                 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Ernst & Young                 LLP) F-2 Report                 of Independent Registered Accounting Firm (Deloitte & Touche                 LLP) F-3 Consolidated                 Balance Sheets  December31, 2006 and 2005 F-4 Consolidated                 Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005                 and 2004 F-6 Consolidated                 Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005                 and 2004 F-7 Consolidated                 Statements of Shareowners Deficitfor the years ended                 December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 F-8 Notes                 to the Consolidated Financial Statements F-9 F-1 REPORT         OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To         the         Board of Directors and Shareowners of Delta         Air         Lines, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession) We         have         audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Delta Air Lines, Inc.         (Debtor-in-Possession) (the Company) as of December 31, 2006, and the related         consolidated statements of operations, shareowners deficit, and cash flows for         the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of         the         Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these         financial statements based on our audit.
We         conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company         Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that         we plan         and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial         statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,         on a         test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial         statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used         and         significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall         financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a         reasonable basis for our opinion.
In         our         opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all         material respects, the consolidated financial position of Delta Air Lines,         Inc.         (Debtor-in-Possession) at December 31, 2006, and the consolidated results         of its         operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with         U.S.         generally accepted accounting principles.
The         accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming         that         Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Debtor-in-Possession) will continue as a going concern.         As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company         filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United         States Bankruptcy Code on September 14, 2005 which raises substantial doubt         about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans         in regard to this matter are also described in Note 1. The consolidated         financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible         future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the         amounts         and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this         uncertainty.
As         discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the         Company changed its methods of accounting for postretirement benefit plans         and         share-based compensation.
We         have         also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting         Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Delta Air Lines, Inc.s         (Debtor-in-Possession) internal control over financial reporting as of December         31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated         Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway         Commission and our report dated March 1, 2007 expressed         an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/         Ernst & Young LLP Atlanta,         Georgia March         1,         2007 F-2 REPORT         OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED ACCOUNTING FIRM To         the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Delta Air Lines, Inc.
Atlanta,         Georgia We         have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Delta Air Lines,         Inc. (Debtor and Debtor-in -Possession) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of         December31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,         cash flows, and shareowners deficit for each of the two years in the period         ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility         of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on         these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company         Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that         we plan         and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial         statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,         on a         test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial         statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used         and         significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall         financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a         reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred to above         present         fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Delta Air Lines,         Inc. (Debtor and Debtor-in -Possession) and subsidiaries at December31,         2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of         the         two years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with         accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Notes1 and2, the Company has filed for         reorganization under Chapter11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The         accompanying financial statements do not purport to reflect or provide for         the         consequences of the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular, such financial         statements do not purport to show (a)as to assets, their realizable value         on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (b)as         to prepetition liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or         contingencies, or the status and priority thereof; (c)as to shareowner         accounts, the effect of any changes that may be made in the capitalization         of         the Company; or (d)as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be         made in its business.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming         that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note2         to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys recurring losses, labor         issues and its bankruptcy filing result in uncertainty regarding the realization         of assets and satisfaction of liabilities, without substantial adjustments         and/or changes in ownership, and raise substantial doubt about the Companys         ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans concerning these         matters are described in Note1. The consolidated financial statements do         not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

F-8 NOTES           TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ..
Note       1. Chapter 11 Proceedings General       Information Delta       Air       Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a major air carrier that provides air       transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S. and around the       world. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Delta       Air       Lines, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries, including Comair, Inc.       (Comair), which are collectively referred to as Delta.
On       September 14, 2005 (the Petition Date), we and substantially all of our       subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for       reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern       District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). The reorganization cases are       being jointly administered under the caption In re Delta Air Lines, Inc., et       al., Case No. 05-17923-ASH.
The       Debtors are operating as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the       Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the       Bankruptcy Code. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are       authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business,       but       may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without       the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
Our       reorganization in Chapter 11 has involved a fundamental transformation of our       business. Shortly after the Petition Date, we outlined a business plan intended       to make Delta a simpler, more efficient and more customer focused airline with       an improved financial condition. Under this plan, we were seeking $3.0 billion       in annual financial improvements by the end of 2007 through revenue increases       and cost reductions. As of December 31, 2006, we reached that goal and these       improvements are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements for       2006. We expect we will achieve additional financial improvements in 2007.
As       a result of our reorganization, we expect to emerge from bankruptcy as a       competitive, standalone airline with a global network.
Our       business strategy touches all facets of our operations - the destinations we       will serve, the way we will serve our customers, and the fleet we will operate       -       in order to earn customer preference and continue to improve revenue       performance. At the same time, we intend to remain focused on maintaining the       competitive cost structure we have obtained from our reorganization to improve       our financial position and pursue long-term stability as a standalone       carrier.
Important       aspects of our emergence business strategy include the following:  Leveraging                 Network Strength to Provide Expanded International Service.
We                 will continue to focus on international growth. With our                 geographically-balanced hubs, we believe we are well-positioned for                 international growth from the U.S. to Europe and Latin America. In                 addition, we expect our hubs will help us increase service to Africa                 and                 Asia.
Maintaining                 Focus on Improving the Customer Experience.
Our                 focus on safety will remain our top priority. We are also committed                 to                 continuous improvement throughout our operations to earn our customers                 preference. We have renewed our focus on improving our product and                 customer service through aircraft cabin and airport                 improvements.
Maximizing                 a Streamlined and Upgraded Fleet.
We                 are supporting the ongoing changes to our network by bolstering our                 internationally-capable mainline fleet. We plan to pursue additional                 strategic improvements to our fleet by adding high-performance aircraft                 that will enable us to serve new destinations with appropriate capacity.                 We have announced plans to add 28 internationally capable aircraft                 scheduled for delivery in 2007 through                 2009.
Capturing                 the Benefit of Competitive Cost Structure.
Through                 initiatives undertaken during the Chapter 11 proceedings and previous                 productivity initiatives, we currently have one of the lowest mainline                 unit cost structures of any full service carrier. These efforts have                 resulted in reduced costs throughout our organization, including                 reductions in employment costs, retiree pension and healthcare costs                 and                 aircraft fleet costs. We recognize that, to succeed, we must maintain                 the                 competitive unit cost structure that we developed through our                 restructuring efforts.
F-9 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Generating                 Cash Flow from Operations Necessary to Fund Capital Expenditures                 and                 Reduce Debt.
Over an extended period following emergence from Chapter 11, we intend                 to                 balance long-term operating growth with overall credit improvement.                 At                 emergence from bankruptcy, we expect to have significantly reduced                 our                 total debt levels from pre-petition levels. Ongoing improvements                 to our                 financial condition are, however, necessary for us to withstand industry                 and economic volatility and to have favorable, consistent access                 to                 capital markets.
Filing       of Plan of Reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court.
In       order       to successfully exit bankruptcy, the Debtors must propose and obtain       confirmation from the Bankruptcy Court of a plan (or plans) of reorganization       that satisfies the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors had the       exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization until February 15, 2007, and       have until April 16, 2007 to obtain the necessary acceptances to a plan. These       periods may be extended by the Bankruptcy Court for cause. If the Debtors exclusivity period were to lapse, any party in interest may file a plan of       reorganization for any of the Debtors.
On       December 19, 2006, we filed with the Bankruptcy Court our Plan of Reorganization       and a related Disclosure Statement, which contemplate that Delta will emerge       from Chapter 11 as an independent airline. The Plan of Reorganization, as       amended (the Plan), addresses various subjectswith respect tothe       Debtors, including the resolution of pre-petition obligations as well as the       capital structure and corporate governance after exit from Chapter       11.
The       Plan       provides that most holders of allowed unsecured claims against the Debtors       will       receive common stock of reorganized Delta in satisfaction of their claims.       Some       holders of allowed unsecured claims against the Debtors would have the right       to       request cash proceeds of sales of common stock of reorganized Delta in lieu       of       such stock, and certain others would receive cash in satisfaction of their       claims. Current holders of Deltas equity interests would not receive any       distributions, and their equity interests would be cancelled once the Plan       becomes effective.
On       February 7, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court approved the amended Disclosure       Statement, and authorized the Debtors to begin soliciting votes from creditors       to approve the Plan. The official committee of unsecured creditors (the Creditors Committee) and the two official retiree committees appointed in the       Debtors Chapter 11 proceedings each support the Plan. To be accepted by holders       of claims against the Debtors, the Plan must be approved by at least one-half       in       number and two-thirds in dollar amount of claims actually voting in each       impaired class.
April       9,       2007 is the deadline for creditors to vote on the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court       has       scheduled a confirmation hearing on April 25, 2007 to consider approval of       the       Plan. If the Plan is approved by the creditors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy       Court, the Debtors are planning to emerge from Chapter 11 shortly       thereafter.
Under       certain circumstances set forth in Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code,       the       Bankruptcy Court may confirm a plan even if such plan has not been accepted       by       all impaired classes of claims and equity interests. A class of claims or equity       interests that does not receive or retain any property under the plan on account       of such claims or interests is deemed to have voted to reject the plan. The       precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan       notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or       equity interests depends upon a number of factors, including the status and       seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e.,       secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, preferred       or       common stock). Generally, with respect to common stock interests, a plan may       be crammed down even if the shareowners receive no recovery if the proponent of       the plan demonstrates that (1) no class junior to the common stock is receiving       or retaining property under the plan and (2) no class of claims or interests       senior to the common stock is being paid more than in full.
Notices       to Creditors; Effect of Automatic Stay.
Shortly       after the Petition Date, the Debtors began notifying all known current or       potential creditors of the Chapter 11 filing. Subject to certain exceptions       under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors Chapter 11 filing automatically       enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of any judicial or administrative       proceedings or other actions against the Debtors or their property to recover       on, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date. Thus, for       example, most creditor actions to obtain possession of property from the       Debtors, or to create, perfect or enforce any lien against the property of       the       Debtors, or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or remedies       with respect to a pre-petition claim, are enjoined unless and until the       Bankruptcy Court lifts the automatic stay. Vendors are being paid for goods       furnished and services provided after the Petition Date in the ordinary course       of business.
F-10 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Appointment       of Creditors Committee.
As       required by the Bankruptcy Code, the United States Trustee for the Southern       District of New York appointed the Creditors Committee. The Creditors Committee       and its legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that       come       before the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Debtors. The Creditors Committee       has been generally supportive of the Debtors positions on various matters,       including the Debtors Plan.
Rejection       of Executory Contracts.
Under       Section 365 and other relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors       may       assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired       leases, including leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft engines,       subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions.       By       order of the Bankruptcy Court, our Section 365 rights to assume, assume and       assign, or reject unexpired leases of non-residential real estate expire on       April 16, 2007 (subject to extension by the Bankruptcy Court). In general,       rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is treated as a       pre-petition breach of the executory contract or unexpired lease in question       and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors of performing their       future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles       the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim       for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such rejected       contracts or leases can file claims against the Debtors for such damages.       Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires       the Debtors to cure existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired       lease.
Any       description of an executory contract or unexpired lease elsewhere in these       Notes, including where applicable our express termination rights or a       quantification of our obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is       qualified by, any overriding rejection rights we have under the Bankruptcy       Code.
We       expect       that liabilities subject to compromise and resolution in the Chapter 11       proceedings will arise in the future as a result of damage claims created by       the       Debtors rejection of various executory contracts and unexpired leases. Such       claims may be material (see Magnitude of Potential Claims below).
Special       Protection Applicable to Leases and Secured Financing of Aircraft and Aircraft       Equipment.
Notwithstanding the general discussion above of the impact of the automatic       stay, under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code (Section 1110), certain       secured parties, lessors and conditional sales vendors may take possession       of       certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related       equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional       sale       contract pursuant to their agreement with the Debtors. Section 1110 provides       that, unless the Debtors agree to perform under the agreement and cure all       defaults within 60 calendar days after the Petition Date, such financing party       can take possession of such equipment.
Section       1110 effectively shortens the automatic stay period to 60 days with respect       to       Section 1110 eligible aircraft, engines and related equipment, subject to the       following two conditions. The Debtors may elect, with Bankruptcy Court approval,       to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing and cure any       defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy Code (which does not preclude       later rejecting any related lease) (a Section 1110(a) Election).       Alternatively, the Debtors may extend the 60-day period by agreement of the       relevant financing party, with Bankruptcy Court approval (a Section 1110(b)       Stipulation). In the absence of either such arrangement, the financing party       may take possession of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights       or       remedies to sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such       equipment.
The       60-day period under Section 1110 expired on November 14, 2005. We have made       Section 1110(a) Elections with respect to 204 aircraft.       We have also entered into, or reached agreements in principle to enter into,       Section 1110(b) Stipulations with respect to approximately 309 aircraft. As       to       the remainder of the aircraft subject to Section 1110, the automatic stay       terminated on November 15, 2005 and, as of such date, the related financing       parties were able to exercise their remedies and take enforcement actions at       their election.
While       we       have reached agreement with respect to certain of our aircraft obligations       and       are negotiating with respect to many of our other aircraft obligations, the       ultimate outcome of these negotiations cannot be predicted with certainty.       To       the extent we are unable to reach definitive agreements with aircraft financing       parties, those parties may seek to repossess aircraft. The loss of a significant       number of aircraft could result in a material adverse effect on our financial       and operating performance.
F-11 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Request       for Adequate Protection.
Certain       aircraft financing parties have filed motions with the Bankruptcy Court seeking       adequate protection against the risk that their aircraft collateral could lose       value while in the possession of or while being used by the Debtors. The       Bankruptcy Court could determine that such parties are not adequately protected       and that the Debtors must pay certain amounts, which could be material, in       order       to continue using the equipment.
The       Debtors have entered into stipulations with several aircraft financing parties       pursuant to which the aircraft financing parties agreed to defer the filing       of a       motion seeking adequate protection and the Debtors agreed that such delay would       not affect the right (if any) of these parties to adequate protection should       they later file a motion.
Collective       Bargaining Agreements.
Section       1113 of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to reject its collective bargaining       agreements with its unions if the debtor first satisfies several statutorily       prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the Bankruptcy       Courts approval of the rejection. The debtor must make a proposal to modify its       existing collective bargaining agreements based on the most complete and       reliable information available at the time, must bargain in good faith and       must       share relevant information with its unions. The proposed modifications must       be       necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all       affected parties are treated fairly and equitably relative to the creditors       and       the debtor. Rejection is appropriate if the unions refuse to agree to the       debtors necessary proposals without good cause and the balance of the       equities favors rejection.
The       Air       Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) is the collective bargaining       representative of Deltas approximately 5,810 pilots. Because we were unable to       reach an agreement with ALPA during negotiations in the fall of 2005 to reduce       our pilot labor costs, on November 1, 2005, we filed a motion with the       Bankruptcy Court to reject the collective bargaining agreement under Section       1113 of the Bankruptcy Code. We continued to negotiate with ALPA after filing       this motion and, as described below, reached a comprehensive agreement with       ALPA       that was ratified by Delta pilots and approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
The       comprehensive agreement with ALPA became effective June 1, 2006, and becomes       amendable December 31, 2009 (Contract Period). It provides for changes in       pilot pay rates, benefits and work rules. In addition, ALPA agreed not to oppose       termination of Deltas primary qualified defined benefit pension plan for pilots       (Pilot Plan), which was terminated effective September 2, 2006 (see Note 10).       We expect to receive approximately $280 million in average annual pilot labor       cost savings during the Contract Period, excluding savings we will receive       from       the termination of the primary Pilot Plan and the related non-qualified       plans.
The       comprehensive agreement provides, among other things, that:  the                 14% hourly pilot wage rate reduction, and other pilot pay and cost                 reductions equivalent to an approximately additional 1% hourly wage                 rate                 reduction, which became effective on December 15, 2005 under an interim                 agreement between Delta and ALPA, remain in effect, with annual pay                 rate                 increases beginning in January                 2007.
ALPA                 has a $2.1 billion allowed general, unsecured pre-petition claim                 in our                 bankruptcy proceedings.
we                 will issue for the benefit of pilots, on a date that is no later                 than 120                 days following our emergence from bankruptcy, senior unsecured notes                 (Pilot Notes) with an aggregate principal amount equal to $650 million,                 a term of up to 15 years and an annual interest rate calculated to                 ensure                 that the Pilot Notes trade at par on the issuance date. The Pilot                 Notes                 are pre-payable at any time at our option, and we may replace all                 or a                 portion of the principal amount of Pilot Notes with cash prior to                 their                 issuance.
eligible                 pilots will participate in a company-wide profit-sharing plan that                 will                 provide an aggregate payout of 15% of our annual pre-tax income (as                 defined) up to $1.5 billion and 20% of annual pre-tax income over                 $1.5                 billion.
we                 will not seek relief under Section 1113 during these Chapter 11                 proceedings with respect to the pilot collective bargaining agreement                 unless we are in imminent risk of our post-petition financing (as                 described in Note 6) being accelerated on account of an imminent                 breach of                 the financial covenants in such financing, we have used our best                 efforts                 to seek a waiver of such breach but have not been able to secure                 such a                 waiver, and we would be unable to remedy such a breach without labor                 cost                 reductions.
F-12 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Throughout       the Chapter 11 proceedings, Comair has been in negotiations with the unions       that       represent its flight attendants, maintenance employees and pilots to reduce       the       labor costs of each of these employee groups. On October 13, 2006, Comair       reached a tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters       (IBT), which represents Comairs approximately880 flight attendants. The       tentative agreement was ratified by Comairs flight attendants and approved by       the Bankruptcy Court. It became effective December 31, 2006, and becomes       amendable December 31, 2010.
Earlier       in 2006, Comair reached agreements with the International Association of       Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) and ALPA, which represent Comairs       approximately535 maintenance employees and1,345 pilots,       respectively. These agreements were, however, conditioned on Comairs obtaining       certain labor cost reductions under its collective bargaining agreement with       the       IBT. Because the Bankruptcy Court denied in April 2006 Comairs initial motion       to reject its collective bargaining agreement with the IBT, Comair reduced       the       amount of flight attendant labor cost reductions it sought and received from       the       IBT to a level below that required by the conditions in the agreements with       the       IAM and ALPA. As a result, Comair was required to renegotiate its cost reduction       agreements with the IAM and ALPA.
On       October 18, 2006, Comair reached an agreement with the IAM that has been       approved by the Bankruptcy Court and is not conditioned on Comairs reaching       agreements with the IBT or ALPA. This agreement became effective December 31,       2006, and becomes amendable December 31, 2010. Because Comair was not able       to       reach an agreement with ALPA on pilot labor cost reductions, on November 2,       2006, Comair filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court under Section 1113 to       reject Comairs collective bargaining agreement with ALPA. The Bankruptcy Court       granted this motion on December 21, 2006.
On       December 29, 2006, Comair and ALPA entered into an agreement whereby, among       other things, Comair agreed not to implement certain changes to the ALPA       collective bargaining agreement, and ALPA agreed not to call a strike of Comair       pilots, before February 2, 2007. The Bankruptcy Court extended this agreement       until February 9, 2007, and the parties subsequently extended it to February       12,       2007.
On       February 7, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court granted Comairs motion to enjoin a       strike or other job action by ALPA and its members. ALPA has appealed the       Bankruptcy Courts (1) Section 1113 ruling to the U.S. District Court for the       Southern District of New York and (2) ruling enjoining a strike to the U.S.       Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. ALPA has agreed to withdraw these       appeals if the tentative agreement described in the next paragraph becomes       effective.
On       February 12, 2007, Comair and ALPA reached a tentative agreement to reduce       Comairs pilot labor costs. The agreement is subject to ratification by Comair       pilots and Bankruptcy Court approval. If ratified and approved, the agreement       would become effective March 2, 2007, and become amendable on March 2, 2011.       We       cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Settlement       Agreement with the PBGC .       On       December 4, 2006, we entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement with       the       Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC) regarding the termination of       the Pilot Plan. For information regarding this agreement, see Note 10.
Payment       of Insurance Benefits to Retired Employees.
Section       1114 of the Bankruptcy Code addresses a debtors ability to modify certain       retiree disability, medical and death benefits (Covered Benefits). To modify       Covered Benefits, the debtor must satisfy certain statutorily prescribed       procedural and substantive prerequisites and obtain either (1) the Bankruptcy       Courts approval or (2) the consent of an authorized representative of retirees.       The debtor must make a proposal to modify the Covered Benefits based on the       most       complete and reliable information available at the time, must bargain in good       faith and must share relevant information with the retiree representative.       In       addition, the proposed modifications must be necessary to permit the       reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all affected parties are       treated fairly and equitably relative to the creditors and the       debtor.
F-13 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       Bankruptcy Court directed the appointment of two separate retiree committees       under Section 1114, one to serve as the authorized representative of non-pilot       retirees, and the other to serve as the authorized representative of pilot       retirees. On October 19, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court approved agreements that       we       reached with these committees regarding healthcare benefits for current       retirees. These agreements became effective January 1, 2007. See Note 10 for       additional information on these agreements.
Magnitude       of Potential Claims.
The       Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court schedules and statements of financial       affairs setting forth, among other things, the assets and liabilities of the       Debtors, subject to the assumptions filed in connection therewith. All of the       schedules are subject to amendment or modification.
Bankruptcy       Rule 3003(c)(3) requires the Bankruptcy Court to set the time within which       proofs of claim must be filed in a Chapter 11 case. The Bankruptcy Court       established August 21, 2006 at 5:00 p.m. (the Bar Date) as the last date and       time for each person or entity to file a proof of claim against the Debtors.       Subject to certain exceptions, the Bar Date applies to all claims against the       Debtors that arose prior to the Petition Date.
As       of       February 7, 2007, claims totaling about $87.0 billion have been filed with       the       Bankruptcy Court against the Debtors, and we expect new and amended claims       to be       filed in the future, including claims amended to assign values to claims       originally filed with no designated value. We have identified, and we expect       to       continue to identify, many claims that we believe should be disallowed by the       Bankruptcy Court because they are duplicative, have been later amended or       superseded, are without merit, are overstated or for other reasons. As of       February 7, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court has disallowed approximately $1.2 billion       of claims and has not yet ruled on our other objections to claims, the disputed       portions of which aggregate to an additional $2.8 billion. We expect to continue       to file objections in the future. Because the process of analyzing and objecting       to claims will be ongoing, the amount of disallowed claims may increase       significantly in the future.
Through       the claims resolution process, differences in amounts scheduled by the Debtors       and claims filed by creditors will be investigated and resolved, including       through the filing of objections with the Bankruptcy Court where appropriate.       In       light of the substantial number and amount of claims filed, the claims       resolution process may take considerable time to complete, and we expect that       it       will continue after our emergence from Chapter 11. Accordingly, the ultimate       number and amount of allowed claims is not presently known, nor is the exact       recovery with respect to allowed claims presently known.
Costs       of Reorganization.
We have       incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with our       reorganization. The amount of these costs, which are being expensed as incurred,       are expected to significantly affect our results of operations. For additional       information, see Reorganization Items, net in this Note.
Effect       of Filing on Creditors and Shareowners.
Under       the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree       otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be       satisfied in full before shareowners are entitled to receive any distribution       or       retain any property under a plan of reorganization. Under the Plan, current       holders of our common stock would not retain or receive any property, and the       common stock, and other equity interests, would be cancelled upon the effective       date of the Plan. As discussed above (see Filing of Plan of Reorganization with       the Bankruptcy Court), if the requirements of Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy       Code are met, a plan of reorganization can be confirmed notwithstanding its       rejection by the holders of our common stock and notwithstanding the fact that       such holders do not receive or retain any property on account of their equity       interests under the plan. Because of such possibilities, the value of our       liabilities and securities, including our common stock, is highly speculative.       We urge that appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and       future investments in any of the liabilities and/or securities of the       Debtors.
Notice       and Hearing Procedures for Trading in Claims and Equity       Securities.
The       Bankruptcy Court issued a final order to assist us in preserving our net       operating losses (the NOL Order). The NOL Order provides for certain notice       and hearing procedures regarding trading in our common stock. It also provides       a       mechanism by which certain holders of claims may be required to sell some of       their holdings in connection with implementation of a plan of       reorganization.
F-14 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Under       the       NOL Order, any person or entity that (1) is a Substantial Equityholder (as       defined below) and intends to purchase or sell or otherwise acquire or dispose       of Tax Ownership (as defined in the NOL Order) of any shares of our common       stock       or (2) may become a Substantial Equityholder as a result of the purchase or       other acquisition of Tax Ownership of shares of our common stock, must provide       advance notice of the proposed transaction to the Bankruptcy Court, to us and       to       the Creditors Committee. A Substantial Equityholder is any person or entity       that has Tax Ownership of at least nine million shares of our common stock.       The       proposed transaction may not be consummated unless written approval is received       from us within the 15-day period following our receipt of the notice. A       transaction entered into in violation of these procedures will be void as a       violation of the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code and       may       subject the participant to other sanctions. The NOL Order also requires that       each Substantial Equityholder file with the Bankruptcy Court and serve on us       a       notice identifying itself. Failure to comply with this requirement also may       result in the imposition of sanctions.
Under       the       NOL Order, any person or entity that (1) is a Substantial Claimholder (as       defined below) and intends to purchase or otherwise acquire Tax Ownership of       certain additional claims against us or (2) may become a Substantial Claimholder       as a result of the purchase or other acquisition of Tax Ownership of claims       against us, must serve on the Creditors Committee a notice in which such       claimholder consents to the procedures set forth in the NOL Order. A Substantial Claimholder is any person or entity that has Tax Ownership of       claims against us equal to or exceeding $400 million (an amount that could       be       increased in the future). Under the NOL Order, Substantial Claimholders may       be       required to sell certain claims against us if the Bankruptcy Court so orders       in       connection with our filing of the Plan. Other restrictions on trading in claims       may also become applicable pursuant to the NOL Order in connection with our       filing of the Plan.
Liabilities       Subject to Compromise The       following table summarizes the components of liabilities subject to compromise       included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2006 and       2005: (in                 millions) 2006 2005 Pension,                 postretirement and other benefits $ 10,329 $ 8,652 Debt                 and accrued interest 5,079 5,843 Aircraft                 lease related obligations 3,115 1,740 Accounts                 payable and other accrued liabilities 1,294 1,145 Total                 liabilities subject to compromise $ 19,817 $ 17,380 Liabilities       subject to compromise refers to pre-petition obligations that may be impacted       by       the Chapter 11 reorganization process. These amounts represent our current       estimate of known or potential obligations to be resolved in connection with       our       Chapter 11 proceedings.
Differences       between liabilities we have estimated and the claims filed, or to be filed,       will       be investigated and resolved in connection with the claims resolution process.       We will continue to evaluate these liabilities throughout the Chapter 11 process       and adjust amounts as necessary. Such adjustments may be material.
F-15 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Reorganization       Items, net The       following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items,       net       on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31,       2006 and 2005: (in                 millions) 2006 2005 Pilot                 collective bargaining agreement (1) $ 2,100 $  Pilot                 pension termination (2) 1,743  Aircraft                 financing renegotiations, rejections and repossessions (3) 1,671 611 Retiree                 healthcare claims (4) 539  Professional                 fees 110 39 Rejection                 of other executory contracts (5) 89  Compensation                 expense (6) 55  Debt                 issuance and discount costs 13 163 Facility                 leases 8 88 Interest                 income (7) (109 ) (17 ) Vendor                 waived pre-petition debt (36 )  Other 23  Total                 reorganization items, net $ 6,206 $ 884 (1) Allowed                 general, unsecured pre-petition claim in connection with our comprehensive                 agreement with ALPA reducing our pilot labor costs. For additional                 information regarding this agreement, see Collective Bargaining                 Agreements in this Note.
(2) $2.2                 billion and $801 million allowed general, unsecured pre-petition                 claims in                 connection with our settlement agreements with the PBGC and a group                 representing retired pilots, respectively. Charges for these claims                 were                 offset by $1.3 billion in settlement gains associated with the                 derecognition of previously recorded Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified                 plan obligations upon each plans termination. For additional information                 regarding our settlement agreements and the termination of these                 plans,                 see Note 10.
(3) Estimated                 claims for the year ended December 31, 2006 relate to the restructuring                 of                 the financing arrangements of 188 aircraft and the rejection of 16                 aircraft leases. Estimated claims for the year ended December 31,                 2005                 relate to the restructuring of the arrangements of seven aircraft,                 the                 rejection of 50 aircraft leases and the repossession of 15                 aircraft.
(4) Allowed                 general, unsecured pre-petition claims in connection with agreements                 reached with committees representing both pilot and non-pilot retired                 employees reducing their postretirement healthcare benefits. For                 additional information regarding these agreements, see Note                 10.
(5) Allowed                 general, unsecured pre-petition claims primarily related to the rejection                 of an executory contract with our main flight service food supply                 vendor.
(6) Reflects                 a charge for rejecting substantially all of our stock options in                 our                 Chapter 11 proceedings. For additional information regarding the                 rejection                 of our stock options, see Note 2.
(7) Reflects                 interest earned due to the preservation of cash from our Chapter                 11                 proceedings.
Note       2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis       of Presentation The       accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going       concern basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in       the       United States of America (GAAP). This contemplates the realization of assets       and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly,       the Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating       to       the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be       necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Due       to       our Chapter 11 proceedings, the realization of assets and satisfaction of       liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership, are       subject to uncertainty.
Accordingly,       there is substantial doubt about the current financial reporting entitys       ability to continue as a going concern. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we       expect to adopt fresh start reporting in accordance with American Institute       of       Certified Public Accountants (  AICPA  )       Statement of       Position 90-7,  Financial       Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code  (  SOP       90-7  ), which       will       result in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting       purposes.The adoption of fresh start reporting may have a material       impact onthe consolidated financial statements of the new financial       reporting entity.
F-16 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect or provide for       the       consequences of our Chapter 11 proceedings. In particular, the financial       statements do not show (1) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation       basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-petition       liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or       their status and priority; (3) as to shareowners equity accounts, the effect of       any changes that may be made in our capitalization; and (4) as to operations,       the effect of any changes that may be made to our business.
We       have       eliminated all material intercompany transactions in our Consolidated Financial       Statements. We do not consolidate the financial statements of any company in       which we have an ownership interest of 50% or less unless we control that       company. We did not control any company in which we had an ownership interest       of       50% or less for any period presented in our Consolidated Financial       Statements.
In       preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we applied SOP 90-7 which       requires that the financial statements, for periods subsequent to the Chapter       11       filing, distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with       the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly,       certain revenues, expenses, realized gains and losses and provisions for losses       that are realized or incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings are recorded in       reorganization items, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of       Operations. In addition, pre-petition obligations that may be impacted by the       bankruptcy reorganization process have been classified as liabilities subject       to       compromise on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005.       These liabilities are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the       Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts (see Note       1).
Subject       to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise as permitted in the       ordinary course of business, the Debtors may sell or otherwise dispose of or       liquidate assets or settle liabilities in amounts other than those reflected       in       the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, our plan of reorganization       could       materially change the amounts and classifications in our historical Consolidated       Financial Statements.
Accounting       Adjustments During       2006, we recorded certain out-of-period adjustments (Accounting Adjustments)       in our Consolidated Financial Statements that are reflected in our results       for       the year ended December 31, 2006. These adjustments resulted in an aggregate       net       noncash charge approximating $310 million to our Consolidated Statement of       Operations consisting primarily of:  A                 $112 million charge in landing fees and other rents. This adjustment                 is                 associated primarily with our airport facility leases at John F.                 Kennedy                 International Airport in New York. It resulted from historical differences                 associated with recording escalating rent expense based on actual                 rent                 payments instead of on a straight-line basis over the lease term                 as                 required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 13,                 Accounting for Leases (SFAS                 13).
A                 $108 million net charge related to the sale of mileage credits under                 our                 SkyMiles frequent flyer program. This includes an $83 million decrease                 in                 passenger revenues, a $106 million decrease in other, net operating                 revenues, and an $81 million decrease in other operating expenses.                 This                 net charge primarily resulted from the reconsideration of our position                 with respect to the timing of recognizing revenue associated with                 the sale                 of mileage credits that we expect will never be redeemed for                 travel.
A                 $90 million charge in salaries and related costs to adjust our accrual                 for                 postemployment healthcare benefits. This adjustment is due to healthcare                 payments applied to this accrual over several years, which should                 have                 been expensed as incurred.
We       believe the Accounting Adjustments, considered individually and in the       aggregate, are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for each       of       the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In making this assessment,       we       considered qualitative and quantitative factors, including our substantial       net       loss in each of these three years, the noncash nature of the Accounting       Adjustments, our substantial shareowners deficit at the end of each of these       three years and our status as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the       Bankruptcy Code.
F-17 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Use       of Estimates We       are       required to make estimates and assumptions when preparing our Consolidated       Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions       affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the       accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those       estimates.
New       Accounting Standards In       September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS       No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other       Postretirement Plans, an amendment of SFAS Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS       158). This statement, among other things, requires that we recognize the funded       status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in our       Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006, with changes in the funded       status recognized through comprehensive loss in the year in which such changes       occur. Application of this standard resulted in (1) a $685 million net decrease       in accrued pension and other postretirement and postemployment liabilities,       (2)       a $248 million decrease in the intangible pension asset in other noncurrent       assets and (3) a $437 milliondecrease in shareowners deficit. The       adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on our Consolidated Statement of Operations       for any period presented. For additional information regarding the impact of       SFAS 158 on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 10.
In       July       2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in       Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), which       clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as       defined. FIN 48 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice associated       with       certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for       income taxes. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after       December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying this interpretation must       be       reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of shareowners deficit in       2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our Consolidated       Financial Statements and anticipate the adjustment to shareowners deficit will       not be material.
In       December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based       Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires an entity to recognize compensation       expense in an amount equal to the fair value of its share based payments, such       as stock options granted to employees. This standard replaces SFAS No. 123,       Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), and supersedes APB       Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25). We       adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. For additional information regarding       SFAS       123R, see Stock-Based Compensation in this Note.
Cash       and Cash Equivalents We       classify short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months       or less when purchased as cash and cash equivalents. These investments are       recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents       at       December 31, 2006 and 2005 include $156 million and $155 million, respectively,       which is set aside for the payment of certain operational taxes and fees to       governmental authorities.
Under       our       cash management system, we utilize controlled disbursement accounts that are       funded daily. Checks we issue, which have not been presented for payment, are       recorded in accounts payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts       totaled zero and $66 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,       respectively.
Short-Term       Investments At       December 31, 2006, our short-term investments were comprised of auction rate       securities. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments       in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115), we record these investments as       trading securities at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December       31, 2005, we did not have any short-term investments. For additional information       about our accounting for trading securities, see Investments in Debt and Equity       Securities in this Note.
F-18 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Restricted       Cash We       have       restricted cash, which primarily relates to cash held as collateral by credit       card processors and interline clearinghouses and to support certain projected       insurance obligations. Restricted cash included in current assets on our       Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $750 million and $870 million at December       31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Restricted cash recorded in other noncurrent       assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $52 million and $58 million       at       December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Derivative       Financial Instruments Fuel       Hedging Program We       periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which       are comprised of heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts, to manage       our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices. In accordance with SFAS No.       133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS       133), we record the fair market value of our fuel hedge contracts on our       Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize certain changes in these fair values       on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We       believe our fuel hedge contracts will be highly effective during their term       in       offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. We perform       both       a prospective and retrospective assessment to this effect at least quarterly,       including assessing the possibility of counterparty default. If we determine       that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, we discontinue       hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair       market value of the hedge to other (expense) income on our Consolidated       Statements of Operations rather than being deferred in accumulated other       comprehensive loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of our       effectiveness assessment at December 31, 2006, we believe our fuel hedge       contracts will continue to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes       in cash flows.
Changes       in the fair value of fuel hedge contracts that qualify for hedge accounting       are       recorded in shareowners deficit as a component of accumulated other       comprehensive loss. These gains or losses are generally recognized in aircraft       fuel expense when the related aircraft fuel purchases being hedged are consumed.       To the extent that the change in the fair value of a fuel hedge contract does       not perfectly offset the change in the value of the aircraft fuel being hedged,       the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in other       (expense) income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For our heating       oil and jet fuel option contracts, ineffectiveness is measured based on the       intrinsic value of the derivative. The difference between the fair value and       intrinsic value represents the time value of the option contract. Time value       is       excluded from the calculation of ineffectiveness and immediately recognized       in       other (expense) income on our Consolidated Statements of       Operations.
For       additional information about our derivative instruments, see Note       4.
Equity       Warrants and Other Similar Rights We       record       our equity warrants and other similar rights in certain companies at fair value       at the date of acquisition in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated       Balance Sheets. In accordance with SFAS 133, we regularly adjust the recorded       amount to reflect the changes in the fair values of the equity warrants and       other similar rights, and recognize the related gains or losses in other       (expense) income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F-19 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Revenue       Recognition Passenger       Revenue We       record       sales of passenger tickets as air traffic liabilities on our Consolidated       Balance Sheets. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation       or when the ticket expires unused, reducing the related air traffic liability.       We periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and record any       resulting adjustments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period       in which the evaluations are completed. These adjustments relate primarily       to       refunds, exchanges, transactions with other airlines and other items for which       final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets       at amounts other than the original sales price.
We       are       required to charge certain taxes and fees on our passenger tickets. These taxes       and fees include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges,       airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes.       These taxes and fees are legal assessments on the customer. We have an       obligation to act as a collection agent. As we are not entitled to retain these       taxes and fees, we do not include such amounts in passenger revenue. We record       a       liability when the amounts are collected and reduce the liability when payments       are made to the applicable government agency or operating carrier.
We       sell       mileage credits in our SkyMiles frequent flyer program to participating       companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. The       portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates the       fair value of travel to be provided is deferred and recognized as passenger       revenue over the period when transportation is expected to be provided. Amounts       received in excess of the transportations fair value are recognized in income       currently and classified as other revenue. A change in assumptions as to the       period over which the mileage credits are expected to be used (currently 15       to       41 months), the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate       of the fair value of transportation expected to be provided could have a       material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in       future years.
Under       our       contract carrier agreements with six regional air carriers (see Note 8), we       purchase all or a portion of their capacity and are responsible for selling       the       seat inventory we purchase. We record revenue and expenses related to our       contract carrier agreements as regional affiliates passenger revenue and       contract carrier agreements, respectively.
Cargo       Revenue Cargo       revenue is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations when we       provide the transportation.
Other,       net Other,       net revenue includes revenue from (1) a portion of the sale of mileage credits       in our SkyMiles frequent flyer program, discussed above, (2) codeshare       agreements with certain airlines and (3) other miscellaneous service revenue.       Under our codeshare agreements, we sell seats on other airlines flights and       other airlines sell seats on our flights, with each airline separately marketing       its respective seats. Our revenue from other airlines sale of codeshare seats       on our flights is recorded in passenger revenue on our Consolidated Statement       of       Operations.
Long-Lived       Assets We       record       property and equipment at cost and depreciate or amortize these assets on a       straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their respective       estimated useful lives. Residual values for flight equipment are generally       5% of       cost except when guaranteed by a third party for a different amount. We also       capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use       software. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $109       million and $101 million, respectively, for amortization for long-lived assets.       The net book value of these assets totaled $252 million and $288 million at       December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in ground property       and       equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated useful lives       for major asset classifications are as follows: Asset                 Classification Estimated                 Useful Life Flight                 equipment 25                 years Capitalized                 software 5-7                 years Ground                 property and equipment 3-40                 years Leasehold                 improvements Generally                 shorter of lease term or estimated useful life Flight                 and ground equipment under capital lease Shorter                 of lease term or estimated useful                 life F-20 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) In       accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of       Long-Lived Assets, we record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in       operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired       and       the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their       carrying amounts. For long-lived assets held for sale, we record impairment       losses when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value less the cost       to       sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived assets when these assets are       classified as held for sale.
To       determine impairments for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the       fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows)       and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger       yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If impairment occurs,       the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircrafts carrying       amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using       published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as       available. See Note 5 for additional information about asset       impairments.
Goodwill       and Intangible Assets In       accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we apply a       fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and       indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events       or       circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an       interim basis. The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and       indefinite-lived intangible assets is December 31. Intangible assets with       determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their       estimated useful lives. Our operating rights have definite useful lives and       are       amortized over their respective lease terms, which range from nine to 19       years.
We       had       one reporting unit with assigned goodwill at December 31, 2006 and 2005. In       evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare the reporting units       fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting       unit by considering (1) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer       companies and (2) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably       estimable. In applying the projected discounted future cash flow methodology,       we       (1) estimate the reporting units future cash flows based on capacity, passenger       yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors and (2) discount       those       cash flows based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital. If       the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing       is required. If, however, the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair       value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. We       recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting units       goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
We       perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by       comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated       based on projected discounted future cash flows using a similar methodology       as       described above for goodwill. We recognize an impairment charge if the assets       carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.
See       Note       5 for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets impairment       charges recorded during 2004.
Interest       Expense While       operating as a debtor-in-possession, in accordance with SOP 90-7, we record       interest expense only to the extent (1) interest will be paid during our Chapter       11 proceeding or (2) it is probable interest will be an allowed priority,       secured, or unsecured claim. Interest expense recorded on our Consolidated       Statements of Operations totaled $870 million and $1.0 billion for the years       ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Contractual interest expense       (including interest expense that is associated with obligations classified       as       liabilities subject to compromise) totaled $1.2 billion for each of the years       ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
F-21 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Equity       Method Investments We       use       the equity method to account for our investment in a company when we have       significant influence but not control over the companys operations. Under the       equity method, we initially record our investment at cost and then adjust the       carrying value of the investment to recognize our proportional share of the       companys net income (loss). In addition, dividends received from the company       reduce the carrying value of our investment.
During       2004, we sold our remaining ownership and voting interest in Orbitz, Inc. for       $143 million. We recognized a gain of $123 million on this transaction in gain       from sale of investments, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for       the year ended December 31, 2004.
Income       Taxes In       accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), we       account for deferred income taxes under the liability method. Under this method,       we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax effects of       temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets       and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance       is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when necessary. Deferred tax assets       and liabilities are recorded net as current and noncurrent deferred income       taxes       on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 9).
Our       income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject       to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.       Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns       are       reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that       various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which       could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the       reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that       affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of       limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current       calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance,       or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We would       adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give       rise       to the revision become known.
Investments       in Debt and Equity Securities We       record       our investments classified as available-for-sale securities at fair value in       other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any change in the       fair value of these securities is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive       loss. We record our investments classified as trading securities at fair value       in current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize changes       in       the fair value of these securities in other (expense) income on our Consolidated       Statements of Operations.
Frequent       Flyer Program For       SkyMiles accounts with sufficient mileage credits to qualify for a free travel       award, we record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards       that are earned and expected to be redeemed for travel on Delta or other       airlines. Our incremental costs include (1) our system average cost per       passenger for fuel, food and other direct passenger costs for awards to be       redeemed on Delta and (2) contractual costs for awards to be redeemed on other       airlines. We periodically record adjustments to this liability in other       operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on awards       earned, awards redeemed, changes in our estimated incremental costs and changes       to the SkyMiles program. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact       on the liability in the year in which the change occurs and in future years.       The       liability is recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance       Sheets.
F-22 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Deferred       Gains on Sale and Leaseback Transactions We       amortize deferred gains on the sale and leaseback of property and equipment       under operating leases over the lives of these leases. The amortization of       these       gains is recorded as a reduction to rent expense. Gains on the sale and       leaseback of property and equipment under capital leases reduce the carrying       value of the related assets.
Manufacturers       Credits We       periodically receive credits in connection with the acquisition of aircraft       and       engines. These credits are deferred until the aircraft and engines are       delivered, and then applied on a pro rata basis as a reduction to the cost       of       the related equipment.
Maintenance       Costs We       record       maintenance costs in operating expenses as they are incurred.
Inventories Inventories       of expendable parts related to flight equipment are carried at moving average       cost and charged to operations as consumed. An allowance for obsolescence is       provided for the cost of these parts over the remaining useful life of the       related fleet. We also provide allowances for parts currently identified as       excess or obsolete to reduce the carrying costs to the lower of cost or net       realizable value. These parts are assumed to have an estimated residual value       of       5% of the original cost.
Advertising       Costs We       expense advertising costs as other selling expenses in the year incurred.       Advertising expense was $150 million, $164 million, and $148 million for the       years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Commissions We       record       passenger commissions in prepaid expenses and other on our Consolidated Balance       Sheets when the related passenger tickets are sold. Passenger commissions are       recognized in operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations       when the transportation is provided and the related revenue is       recognized.
Stock-Based       Compensation Effective       January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value provisions of SFAS 123R. This       standard requires companies to measure the cost of employee services in exchange       for an award of equity instruments (typically stock options) based on the       grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value is estimated using       option-pricing models. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during       which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards       (usually the vesting period of the awards). Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R,       we accounted for stock option grants in accordance with APB 25, and accordingly       recognized no compensation expense for the stock option grants if the exercise       price is equal to or more than the fair value of the shares at the date of       grant.
SFAS       123R       is effective for any stock options granted after December 31, 2005. For stock       options granted prior to January 1, 2006, but for which vesting was not complete       on that date, we applied the modified prospective transition method in       accordance with SFAS 123R. Under this method, we account for such awards on       a       prospective basis, with expense being recognized in our Consolidated Statement       of Operations beginning in the March 2006 quarter using the grant-date fair       values previously calculated for our pro forma disclosures. Due to the       application of the modified prospective transition method, comparable prior       periods have not been retroactively adjusted to include share-based       compensation.
F-23 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) We       did       not grant any stock options during the year ended December 31, 2006. The       estimated fair values of stock options granted during the years ended December       31, 2005 and 2004 were derived using the Black-Scholes model. The following       table includes the assumptions used in estimating fair values and the resulting       weighted average fair value of stock options granted in the periods       presented: Stock                 Options Granted Assumption 2006 2005 2004 Risk-free                 interest rate  3.8 % 3.1 % Average                 expected life of stock options (in years)  3.0 3.2 Expected                 volatility of common stock  73.6 % 68.8 % Weighted                 average fair value of a stock option granted $  $ 2 $ 3 The       following table reflectsfor the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,       the pro forma impact to net loss and basic and diluted loss per share had we       accounted for our stock-based compensation plans under the fair value method       in       accordance with SFAS 123, as amended.
Year                 Ended December 31, (in                 millions, except per share data) 2005 2004 Net                 loss: As                 reported $ (3,818 ) $ (5,198 ) Stock                 option compensation expense determined under the fair value                 method (108 ) (38 ) As                 adjusted for the fair value method under SFAS 123R $ (3,926 ) $ (5,236 ) Basic                 and diluted loss per share: As                 reported $ (23.75 ) $ (41.07 ) As                 adjusted for the fair value method under SFAS 123R $ (24.42 ) $ (41.36 ) On       March       20, 2006, we filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion to reject our then       outstanding stock options to avoid the administrative and other costs associated       with these awards. The Bankruptcy Court granted our motion, which resulted       in       substantially all of our stock options being rejected effective March 31, 2006.       In the March 2006 quarter, we recorded in our Consolidated Statement of       Operations (1) $8 million of compensation expense in conjunction with the       adoption of SFAS 123R, which is recorded in salaries and related costs and       (2)       $55 million of compensation expense associated with the rejection of stock       options, which is classified in reorganization items, net and represents the       unamortized fair value of previously granted stock options when we rejected       these stock options.
For       additional information about our stock options, see Note 12.
Fair       Value of Financial Instruments We       record       our cash equivalents and short-term investments at cost, which we believe       approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The estimated fair       values of other financial instruments, including debt and derivative       instruments, have been determined using available market information and       valuation methodologies, primarily discounted cash flow analyses and the       Black-Scholes model.
The       aggregate fair value of our secured and unsecured debt, based primarily on       reported market values, was $11.5 billion and $10.5 billion at December 31,       2006       and 2005 (which includes debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise),       respectively. For additional information about our debt, see Note       6.
Reclassifications Under       our Visa/MasterCard Processing Agreement, the       credit card processor (  Processor  )       is permitted to       withhold payment from our receivables of an amount (  Cash Reserve  )       that is equal to       the Processor s       potential liability for tickets purchased with Visa or MasterCard which have       not       yet been used for travel. The Cash Reserve is recorded in Restricted cash       on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6 for additional information       related to our processing agreement.
For       the year ended December 31, 2006, the change in Cash       Reserve has been reported asa component ofoperating activities on       our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to better reflect the nature of the       restricted cash activities. Prior to 2006, we presented such change as an       investing activity. We have reclassified prior period amounts to be       consistent with the current year presentation. These reclassifications       resulted in a decrease to cash flows from operating activities and a       corresponding increase to cash flows from investing activities of $482 million       for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $15 million for the year ended December       31, 2004 from the amounts previously reported.
We         reclassified certain other prior period amounts in our Consolidated Financial         Statements to be consistent with our current period presentation. The effect         of         these reclassifications is not material.
F-24 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Note       3. Marketable and Other Equity Securities Republic       Airways Holdings, Inc. (Republic Holdings) and       Affiliates We       have       contract carrier agreements with two subsidiaries of Republic Holdings  Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua) and Shuttle America Corporation       (Shuttle America). As part of these agreements, we received warrants to       purchase 3.5 million shares of Republic Holdings common stock with exercise       prices ranging from $11.60 to $13.00 per common share. The warrants have       expiration dates between June 2012 and December 2014.
The       warrants were recorded at their fair values on the date received in other       noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values are       primarily being recognized on a straight-line basis over a five year period.       Changes in fair value are recorded in other (expense) incomeon our       Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values totaled $33 million       and       $29 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
For       additional information about our contract carrier agreements with Chautauqua       and       Shuttle America, see Note 8.
priceline.com       Incorporated (priceline) We       have       an agreement with priceline under which we (1) provide ticket inventory that       may       be sold through pricelines Internet-based e-commerce system and (2) received       certain equity interests in priceline.
At       December 31, 2006 and 2005, our investment in priceline consisted of (1) 13.5       million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and (2) warrants issued in 2001       to       purchase 0.8 million shares of priceline common stock at $17.81 per common       share. The Series B Preferred Stock had a carrying value of $13 million, was       classified as an available-for-sale security under SFAS 115 and was recorded       at       face value, which approximates fair value, in other noncurrent assets on our       Consolidated Balance Sheets. The warrants were recorded at fair value in other       noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with any changes in fair       value recorded in other (expense) income on our Consolidated Statements of       Operations. The fair value of the warrants was $20 million and $7 million at       December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Note       4. Risk Management and Financial Instruments Fuel       Price Risk Our       results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in the price of       aircraft fuel. To manage this risk, we periodically enter into derivative       contracts comprised of heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts to       hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements. We do not enter       into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes.
Under       our       Chapter 11 proceedings, we were authorized to hedge up to 50% of our estimated       2006 aggregate fuel consumption, with no single month exceeding 80% of our       estimated fuel consumption. We are also authorized to hedge up to 80% of our       projected fuel consumption for each month in the quarter ending March 31, 2007,       up to 50% for each month in the quarter ending June 30, 2007, up to 35% for       each       month in the quarter ending September 30, 2007 and up to 25% for each month       in       the quarter ending December 31, 2007. We currently cannot enter into any fuel       hedge contract that extends beyond December 31, 2007 without approval from       the       Bankruptcy Court or the Creditors Committee. As of January 31, 2007, we had       hedged approximately 24% of our projected aircraft fuel requirements for the       nine months ended September 2007 using heating oil and jet fuel zero-cost collar       and swap contracts. We have not entered into any hedges for the December 2007       quarter.
F-25 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Losses       (gains) recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years       ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 related to our fuel hedge contracts       are       as follows: For                 the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in                 millions) Aircraft                 fuel expense Other                 expense (income) Aircraft                 fuel expense Other                 expense (income) Aircraft                 fuel expense Other                 expense (income) Open                 fuel hedge contracts $  $ 5 $  $  $  $  Settled                 fuel hedge contracts 108 32   (105 ) 28 Total $ 108 $ 37 $  $  $ (105 ) $ 28 Our       open       fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2006 had an estimated fair value loss       of       $27 million, which we recorded in accounts payable on our Consolidated Balance       Sheet. We did not have any fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2005.
Interest       Rate Risk Our       exposure to market risk from volatility in interest rates is associated with       our       long-term debt obligations, cash portfolio, workers compensation obligations       and pension, postemployment and postretirement benefits.
Market       risk associated with our fixed and variable rate long-term debt relates to       the       potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings,       respectively, from an increase in interest rates. At December 31, 2006 and       2005,       $5.6 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, of our debt (including debt       classified as liabilities subject to compromise) had a variable interest       rate.
Market       risk associated with our cash portfolio relates to the potential change in       interest income from a decrease in interest rates. Workers compensation       obligation risk relates to the potential changes in our future obligations       and       expenses from a change in interest rates used to discount these obligations.       Pension, postemployment and postretirement benefits risk relates to the       potential changes in our benefit obligations, funding and expenses from a change       in interest rates (see Note 10).
Credit       Risk To       manage       credit risk associated with our aircraft fuel price hedging program, we select       counterparties based on their credit ratings and limit our exposure to any       one       counterparty. We also monitor the market position of this program and our       relative market position with each counterparty. The credit exposure related       to       this program was not significant at December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Our       accounts receivable are generated largely from the sale of passenger airline       tickets and cargo transportation services. The majority of these sales are       processed through major credit card companies, resulting in accounts receivable,       which are subject to certain holdbacks by the credit card processors. We also       have receivables from the sale of mileage credits under our SkyMiles frequent       flyer program to participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels       and car rental agencies. We believe that the credit risk associated with these       receivables is minimal and that the allowance for uncollectible accounts that       we       have provided is appropriate.
F-26 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Self-Insurance       Risk We       self-insure a portion of our losses from claims related to workers compensation, environmental issues, property damage, medical insurance for       employees and general liability. Losses are accrued based on an estimate of       the       ultimate aggregate liability for claims incurred, using independent actuarial       reviews based on standard industry practices and our historical experience.       A       portion of our projected workers compensation liability is secured with       restricted cash collateral (see Note 2).
Equity       Warrants and Other Similar Rights We       own       equity warrants and other similar rights in certain companies, primarily       Republic Holdings and priceline. The fair value of these rights were $53 million       and $37 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair value       gain       (loss) adjustment of equity rights totaled $16 million, $1 million, and $(3)       million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively.       For       additional information about our accounting policy for and ownership of these       rights, respectively, see Notes 2 and 3.
Note       5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The       following table includes the components of goodwill at December 31, 2006, 2005       and 2004, and impairment charges recorded during 2004: Reporting                 Unit (in                 millions) Mainline ASA Comair Total Balance                 at January 1, 2004 $ 227 $ 498 $ 1,367 $ 2,092 Impairment                 charge  (498 ) (1,367 ) (1,865 ) Balance                 at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 $ 227 $  $  $ 227 During       2004, we re-evaluated the estimated fair values of our reporting units       (Mainline, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. (ASA) and Comair) in light of the       implementation of initiatives intended to strengthen our competitive position       and the completion of our new long-range cash flow plans. These actions       reflected, among other things, (1) the strategic role of ASA and Comair in       our       business (see Note 11 for information about our sale of ASA in 2005), (2) the       projected impact of changes to our fare structure on the revenues of each of       our       reporting units and (3) an expectation of the continuation of historically       high       fuel prices. These factors had a substantial negative impact on the impairment       test results for ASA and Comair. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge       for the full value of goodwill at ASA and Comair.
Our       goodwill impairment test for Mainline as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004       resulted in no impairment.
The       following table presents information about our intangible assets, other than       goodwill, at December 31: 2006 2005 (in                 millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Definite-lived                 intangible assets : Operating                 rights $ 121 $ (104 ) $ 125 $ (103 ) Other 3 (3 ) 3 (3 ) Total $ 124 $ (107 ) $ 128 $ (106 ) (in                 millions) Net Carrying Amount Net Carrying Amount Indefinite-lived                 intangible assets : International                 routes and slots $ 71 $ 51 Other 1 1 Total $ 72 $ 52 F-27 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) At       December 31, 2004, we recorded a $9 million impairment charge for certain of       our       international routes due to our decision not to utilize these routes for the       foreseeable future. This charge is recorded in impairment of intangible assets       on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,       our       impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no       impairment. For additional information about our accounting policy for goodwill       and other intangible assets, see Note 2.
London       Route Agreement On       October 30, 2006, we purchased from United Air Lines, Inc. its authority to       operate direct transatlantic service between New York and London (the Route).       We agreed to purchase the Route for up to $21 million, consisting of $13 million       which we paid at the closing of the transaction and four annual payments of       $2       million payable in 2007 through 2010. If, however, the current bilateral       agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom is expanded at any time during       that four-year period to permit more than two U.S. carriers to operate service       on the Route, then our obligation to make any remaining payments ceases.

(8) In                 October 2006, we refinanced our 9.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2008                 (Senior Notes). In connection with the refinancing, we repaid $39                 million in principal of the Senior Notes. We refinanced the remaining                 $196                 million principal of the Senior Notes by issuing $196 million principal                 amount of new notes (New Notes). The New Notes are due in installments                 through September 2012 and bear interest at a floating rate based                 on LIBOR                 plus a margin. The New Notes are secured by the same 32 aircraft                 as the                 Senior Notes.
(9) In                 accordance with SOP 90-7, substantially all of our unsecured debt                 has been                 classified as liabilities subject to compromise. Additionally, certain                 of                 our undersecured debt has been classified as liabilities subject                 to                 compromise.

(10) Certain                 of our secured and under-secured debt, which was classified as liabilities                 subject to compromise at December 31, 2005, has been reclassified                 from                 liabilities subject to compromise or converted to operating leases                 during                 the year ended December 31, 2006 in connection with in-court restructuring                 initiatives undertaken as part of our Chapter 11                 reorganization.
Future       Maturities The       following table summarizes the contractual maturities of our debt, including       current maturities, at December 31, 2006: Years                 Ending December 31, (in                 millions) Principal                 Not Subject                 to Compromise Principal Subject                 to Compromise Total Principal Amount 2007 $ 1,466 $ 453 $ 1,919 2008 2,152 640 2,792 2009 392 868 1,260 2010 1,300 177 1,477 2011 1,307 103 1,410 After                 2011 1,071 2,704 3,775 Total $ 7,688 $ 4,945 $ 12,633 DIP       Credit Facility On       September 16, 2005, we entered into a Secured Super-Priority       Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement (the DIP Credit Facility) to borrow up       to $1.7 billion from a syndicate of lenders arranged by General Electric Capital       Corporation (GECC) and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., for which GECC       acted as administrative agent. On October 7, 2005, we entered into an amendment       to the DIP Credit Facility, resulting in borrowings of $1.9 billion under the       DIP Credit Facility, as amended.
The       DIP       Credit Facility consists of a $600 million Term Loan A arranged by GECC (the       TLA), a $700 million Term Loan B arranged by GECC (the TLB) and a $600       million Term Loan C arranged jointly by GECC and Morgan Stanley (the TLC)       (together with the TLA and TLB, collectively, the DIP Loans). We applied a       portion of these proceeds to (1) repay in full the $480 million principal amount       outstanding under our pre-petition credit facility for which GECC was agent       (GE       Pre-Petition Facility); (2) repay in full the $500 million principal amount       outstanding under our Amex Pre-Petition Facility (defined below); and (3) prepay       $50 million of the $350 million principal amount outstanding under our Amex       Post-Petition Facility (defined below). The remainder of the proceeds of the       DIP       Loans is available for our general corporate purposes.
Availability       of funds under the TLA is subject to a borrowing base calculation. If the       outstanding amount of the TLA at any time exceeds the borrowing base, we must       immediately repay the TLA or post cash collateral in an amount equal to the       excess.
F-30 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       TLA,       TLB and TLC each mature on the earliest of (1) March 16, 2008, (2) the effective       date of a plan of reorganization in the Debtors bankruptcy cases or (3)       accelerations and termination of the obligations under such loans if an event       of       default occurs under the DIP Credit Facility, as more fully discussed below.       Prior to March 27, 2006, the TLA bore interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus       4.50% or an index rate plus 3.75%; the TLB bore interest, at our option, at       LIBOR plus 6.50% or an index rate plus 5.75%; and the TLC bore interest, at       our       option, at LIBOR plus 9.00% or an index rate plus 8.25%.
We       may       also request the issuance of up to $200 million in letters of credit under       the       DIP Credit Facility, which must be fully cash collateralized at all times such       letters of credit are outstanding.
Our       obligations under the DIP Credit Facility are guaranteed by substantially all       of       our domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors). We will be required to make       certain mandatory repayments of the DIP Loans in the event we sell certain       assets, subject to certain exceptions. Any portion of the DIP Loans that is       repaid through either voluntary or mandatory prepayment may not be       reborrowed.
The       DIP       Loans and the related guarantees are secured by first priority liens on       substantially all of our and the Guarantors present and future assets       (including assets that previously secured the GE Pre-Petition Facility) and       by       junior liens on certain of our and our Guarantors other assets (including       certain accounts receivable and other assets subject to a first priority lien       securing the Amex Post-Petition Facility described below), in each case subject       to certain exceptions, including an exception for assets that are subject to       financing agreements that are entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the       Bankruptcy Code, to the extent such financing agreements prohibit such       liens.
The       DIP       Credit Facility includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants that       impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations,       including our ability to, among other things, incur or secure other debt, make       investments, sell assets and pay dividends or repurchase stock.
The       financial covenants require us to:  maintain                 unrestricted funds in an amount not less than $750 million through                 May 31,                 2006; $1.0 billion at all times from June 1, 2006, through November                 30,                 2006; $750 million at all times from December 1, 2006, through February                 28, 2007; and $1.0 billion at all times thereafter (Liquidity                 Covenant);  not                 exceed specified levels of capital expenditures during any fiscal                 quarter;                 and  achieve                 specified levels of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,                 amortization and aircraft rent, as defined (EBITDAR), for successive                 trailing 12-month periods through March 2008. During 2005, we were                 required to achieve increasing levels of EBITDAR, including EBITDAR                 of                 $644 million for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2005. Thereafter,                 the minimum EBITDAR level for each successive trailing 12-month period                 continues to increase, including $1.4 billion for the 12-month period                 ended December 31, 2006; $2.0 billion for the 12-month period ending                 December 31, 2007; and $2.0 billion for each 12-month period ending                 thereafter. If our cash on hand exceeds the minimum cash on hand                 that we                 are required to maintain pursuant to the Liquidity Covenant, then                 the                 EBITDAR level that we are required to achieve is effectively reduced                 by                 the amount of such excess cash, up to a maximum reduction of $250                 million                 from the required EBITDAR level.
The       DIP       Credit Facility contains events of default customary for debtor-in-possession       financings, including cross-defaults to the Amex Post-Petition Facility and       certain change of control events. The DIP Credit Facility also includes events       of default specific to our business, including if all or substantially all       of       our flight and other operations are suspended for longer than two days, other       than in connection with a general suspension of all U.S. flights, or if certain       routes and, subject to certain materiality thresholds, other routes, and slots       and gates are revoked, terminated or cancelled. Upon the occurrence of an event       of default, the outstanding obligations under the DIP Credit Facility may be       accelerated and become due and payable immediately.
On       March       27, 2006, we executed an amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended and       Restated DIP Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders, which replaced the       DIP Credit Facility in its entirety. The aggregate amounts available to be       borrowed under the DIP Credit Facility are not changed by the Amended and       Restated DIP Credit Facility. However, under the Amended and Restated DIP Credit       Facility, the interest rates on borrowings have been reduced: the TLA bears       interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 2.75% or an index rate plus 2.00%; the       TLB bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 4.75% or an index rate plus       4.00%; and the TLC bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 7.50% or an       index rate plus 6.75%.
F-31 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility is otherwise substantially the same       as       the DIP Credit Facility, including financial covenants, collateral, guarantees,       maturity date and events of default. The Amended and Restated DIP Credit       Facility allowed the execution of amendments to (1) the Other GECC Agreements       (defined below) and certain other credit facilities previously entered into       by       us with GECC and (2) a reimbursement agreement between us and GECC (the Reimbursement Agreement) related to letters of credit originally totaling $403       million which were issued on our behalf by GECC, to support our obligations       with       respect to tax-exempt special facility bonds issued to refinance the       construction cost of certain airport facilities leased to us. See below for       additional information about the amendments to the credit facilities and the       Reimbursement Agreement.
On       August       31, 2006, we entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated DIP Credit       Facility that authorized us to consummate a fuel inventory supply agreement       (see       Note 8).
Financing       Agreement with Amex On       September 16, 2005, we entered into an agreement (the Modification Agreement)       with American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (Amex) and       American Express Bank, F.S.B. pursuant to which we modified certain existing       agreements with Amex, including two agreements (collectively, the Amex       Pre-Petition Facility) under which we had borrowed $500 million from Amex. The       Amex Pre-Petition Facility consisted of substantially identical supplements       to       the two existing agreements under which Amex purchases SkyMiles from us, the       Membership Rewards Agreement and the Co-Branded Credit Card Program Agreement       (collectively, the SkyMiles Agreements). The Bankruptcy Court approved our       entering into the Modification Agreement and our assuming the SkyMiles       Agreements. Amex has the right, in certain circumstances, to impose a       significant holdback on our receivables, including for tickets purchased using       an American Express credit card but not yet used for travel.
As       required by the Modification Agreement, on September 16, 2005, we used a portion       of the proceeds of our initial borrowing under the DIP Credit Facility to repay       the principal amount of $500 million, together with interest thereon, that       we       had previously borrowed from Amex under the Amex Pre-Petition Facility.       Simultaneously, we borrowed $350 million from Amex pursuant to the terms of       the       Amex Pre-Petition Facility as modified by the Modification Agreement (the Amex       Post-Petition Facility). The amount borrowed under the Amex Post-Petition       Facility is being repaid in equal monthly installments, either as direct monthly       payments from us or as a credit towards Amexs actual purchases of SkyMiles       during the 17-month period commencing in July 2006. Any unused prepayment credit       will carryover to the next succeeding month with a final repayment date for       any       then outstanding advances no later than November 30, 2007. Prior to March 27,       2006, the outstanding advances bore a fee, equivalent to interest, at a rate       of       LIBOR plus a margin of 10.25%. As of the date of effectiveness of the Amended       and Restated DIP Credit Facility, to which Amex consented, the fee on       outstanding advances decreased to a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of       8.75%.
On       October 7, 2005, pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the Modification Agreement       (the Amendment to the Modification Agreement), Amex consented to the       above-described increased principal amount of the DIP Credit Facility from       $1.7       billion to $1.9 billion in return for a prepayment of $50 million under the       Amex       Post-Petition Facility. The prepayment was credited in inverse order of monthly       installments during the 17-month period commencing in July 2006.
Our       obligations under the Amex Post-Petition Facility are guaranteed by the       Guarantors of the DIP Credit Facility. Our obligations under certain of our       agreements with Amex, including our obligations under the Amex Post-Petition       Facility, the SkyMiles Agreements and the agreement pursuant to which Amex       processes travel and other purchases made from us using Amex credit cards (Card       Services Agreement), and the corresponding obligations of the Guarantors, are       secured by (1) a first priority lien on our right to payment from Amex for       purchased SkyMiles, our interest in the SkyMiles Agreements and related assets       and our right to payment from Amex under, and our interest in, the Card Services       Agreement and (2) a junior lien on the collateral securing the DIP Credit       Facility on a first priority basis.
F-32 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) With       certain exceptions, the Amex Post-Petition Facility contains affirmative,       negative and financial covenants substantially the same as in the DIP Credit       Facility. The Amex Post-Petition Facility contains customary events of default,       including cross-defaults to our obligations under the DIP Credit Facility and       to       defaults under certain other of our agreements with Amex. The Amex Post-Petition       Facility also includes events of default specific to our business, including       upon cessation of 50% or more of our business operations (measured by net       revenue) and other events of default comparable to those in the DIP Credit       Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Amex       Post-Petition Facility, the loan under the Amex Post-Petition Facility may       be       accelerated and become due and payable immediately. An event of default under       the Amex Post-Petition Facility results in an immediate cross-default under       the       Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility.
In       connection with the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility, we executed a       conforming amendment and restatement of the Amex Post-Petition Facility. The       financial covenants, collateral, guarantees, maturity dates and events of       default are not changed by the amendment and restatement. As of the date of       effectiveness of the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility, to which Amex       consented, the fee on outstanding advances under the Amex Post-Petition Facility       decreased to a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 8.75%.
On       August       31, 2006, we entered into an amendment to the Amex Post-Petition Facility that       authorized us to consummate a fuel inventory supply agreement (see Note       8).
The       Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility and the Amex Post-Petition Facility       are       subject to an intercreditor agreement that generally regulates the respective       rights and priorities of the lenders under each facility with respect to       collateral and certain other matters.
Letter       of Credit Enhanced Special Facility Bonds At       December 31, 2006, there were outstanding $381 million aggregate principal       amount of tax exempt special facility bonds (Bonds) enhanced by letters of       credit, including:  $295                 million principal amount of bonds issued by the Development Authority                 of                 Clayton County (Clayton Authority) to refinance the construction cost of                 certain facilities leased to us at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta                 International Airport. We pay debt service on these bonds pursuant                 to loan                 agreements between us and the Clayton                 Authority.
$86                 million principal amount of bonds issued by other municipalities                 to                 refinance the construction cost of certain facilities leased to us                 at                 Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and Salt Lake                 City                 International Airport. We pay debt service on these bonds pursuant                 to                 long-term lease agreements.
The       Bonds       (1) have scheduled maturities between 2029 and 2035, (2) currently bear interest       at a variable rate that is determined weekly and (3) may be tendered for       purchase by their holders on seven days notice. Tendered Bonds are remarketed       at       prevailing interest rates.
Principal       and interest on the Bonds are currently paid through drawings on irrevocable,       direct-pay letters of credit currently totaling $387 million issued by GECC       pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement. In addition, if tendered Bonds cannot       be remarketed, the purchase price is paid by drawings on these letters of       credit. The GECC letters of credit were originally scheduled to expire on May       20, 2008. Pursuant to the Amendments (defined below), the GECC letters of credit       will now expire on July 7, 2011. The GECC letters of credit were originally       issued in the amount of $403 million, but a draw on one of the letters of credit       paid off approximately $16 million in special facility bonds related to a Tampa       maintenance base when we rejected the lease for this facility in June 2006       to       streamline our maintenance operations and obtain other cost       savings.
If       a       drawing under a letter of credit is made to pay the purchase price of Bonds       tendered for purchase and not remarketed, our resulting reimbursement obligation       to GECC will bear interest at a base rate or three-month LIBOR plus a margin.       The principal amount of any outstanding reimbursement obligation will be repaid       quarterly through July 7, 2011. Our obligation to reimburse GECC for the drawing       on the letter of credit that secured the Tampa maintenance base special facility       bonds is on these terms as well.
F-33 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Unless       the GECC letters of credit are extended in a timely manner, we will be required       to purchase the Bonds on July 2, 2011, five calendar days prior to the       expiration of the letters of credit. In this circumstance, we could seek, but       there is no assurance that we would be able (1) to sell the Bonds without credit       enhancement at then-prevailing fixed interest rates or (2) to replace the       expiring letters of credit with new letters of credit from an alternate credit       provider and remarket the Bonds.
Reimbursement       Agreement and Other GECC Agreements Under       the       Reimbursement Agreement between us and GECC, we are required to reimburse GECC       for drawings on the letters of credit that support the Bonds. Prior to the       Amendments (as defined below), our reimbursement obligations to GECC were       secured by (1) nine B-767-400 and three B-777-200 aircraft (LOC Aircraft       Collateral), (2) 93 spare Mainline aircraft engines (Engine Collateral) and       (3) a portion of the Mainline aircraft spare parts owned by us (Spare Parts       Collateral), as discussed below.
We       have       three additional financing arrangements with GECC (other than the Amended and       Restated DIP Credit Facility), as referenced in the footnotes to the table       above       in this Note. Prior to the Amendments, the Spare Engines Loan was secured by       (1)       the Engine Collateral, (2) so long as the letters of credit discussed above       are       outstanding, the LOC Aircraft Collateral and (3) a portion of the Spare Parts       Collateral, as discussed below.
The Spare Engines Loan       is not repayable at our election prior to maturity.
Prior       to       the Amendments, the Aircraft Loan was secured by (1) five B-767-400 aircraft       (Other Aircraft Collateral), (2) the Engine Collateral and (3) all Spare Parts       Collateral. Also prior to the Amendments, the Spare Parts Loan was secured       by       (1) the Other Aircraft Collateral, (2) the Engine Collateral and (3) the Spare       Parts Collateral.
Under       our       prior agreement with GECC, the Spare Parts Collateral secured up to $75 million       of our obligations to GECC under (1) the Reimbursement Agreement, (2) the Spare       Engines Loan and (3) 12 CRJ-200 aircraft leases. Additionally, the Engine       Collateral and the Spare Parts Collateral secured, on a subordinated basis,       up       to $160 million of certain other existing debt and aircraft lease obligations       to       GECC and its affiliates (Subordinated GECC Obligations).
On       March       31, 2006, we entered into amendments (the Amendments) to the Reimbursement       Agreement, the Spare Engines Loan, the Aircraft Loan, the Spare Parts Loan       (these last three credit facilities will be referred to collectively as the       Other GECC Agreements) and certain other credit facilities with GECC (other       than the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility).
As       a       result of the Amendments, the LOC Aircraft Collateral, the Spare Engines       Collateral, the Spare Parts Collateral and the Other Engine Collateral       (collectively, the Collateral Pool) secure (1) each of the Other GECC       Agreements, (2) 12 leases for CRJ-200 aircraft we previously entered into with       GECC, (3) leases of up to an additional 15 CRJ-200 aircraft pursuant to the       put       rights described below, (4) the Reimbursement Agreement and (5) all of the       Subordinated GECC Obligations (with no maximum amount). In addition, the       expiration dates of the letters of credit issued in connection with the       Reimbursement Agreement were extended from 2008 to 2011, and the minimum       collateral value test formerly in the Reimbursement Agreement was eliminated.
As       a       condition to the Amendments, we granted GECC the right, exercisable until March       30, 2007, to lease to us up to an additional 15 CRJ-200 aircraft (put rights).       GECC may exercise the put rights only after providing us with prior written       notice, and no more than three such aircraft may be scheduled for delivery       in       the same month. The leases will have terms ranging between 108 months and 172       months, as determined by GECC, and lease rates will be based on the date of       manufacture of the aircraft. We believe that the lease payments for these 15       aircraft will aggregate $215 million over the maximum 172 month term and that       the lease payments approximate current market rates. As of December 31, 2006,       GECC has leased nine of these aircraft to us and we have subleased all nine       aircraft to Connection Carriers.
F-34 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Boston       Airport Terminal Project During       2001, we entered into lease and financing agreements with the Massachusetts       Port       Authority (Massport) for the redevelopment and expansion of Terminal A at       Bostons Logan International Airport. The construction of the new terminal was       funded with $498 million in proceeds from Special Facilities Revenue Bonds       issued by Massport on August 16, 2001. We agreed to pay the debt service on       the       bonds under an agreement with Massport and issued a guarantee to the bond       trustee covering the payment of the debt service. For additional information       about these bonds, see the debt table above. Because we have issued a guarantee       of the debt service on the bonds, we have included the bonds, as well as the       related bond proceeds, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The bonds are       reflected as liabilities subject to compromise and the related remaining       proceeds, which are held in a trust, are reflected as restricted investments       in       other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As       part       of our restructuring efforts, we have entered into a settlement agreement with       Massport, the bond trustee and the bond insurer providing, among other things,       for a reduction in our leasehold premises, the ability to return some additional       space in 2007 and 2011 and the reduction of our lease term to ten years. The       settlement agreement also provides that our obligations with respect to the       bonds shall be eliminated, including the guarantee of debt service, and that       all       rental payments for the leased space shall be made to Massport.
On       February 14, 2007, the Bankruptcy Courtapproved a consent motion       authorizing the settlement agreement, the assumption of the amended lease and       the restructuring of related agreements.
Letter       of Credit Facility Related to Visa/MasterCard Credit Card Processing       Agreement On       January 26, 2006, with the authorization from the Bankruptcy Court, we entered       into a letter of credit facility with Merrill Lynch. Under the Letter of Credit       Reimbursement Agreement, Merrill Lynch issued a $300 million irrevocable standby       letter of credit (Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit) for the benefit of our       Processor. As contemplated in our Visa/MasterCard credit card processing       agreement (Processing Agreement), we are providing the Merrill Lynch Letter of       Credit as a substitution for a portion of the cash withholding that the       Processor maintains.
Under       the       Processing Agreement, the Processor is permitted to withhold a Cash Reserve       that       is equal to the Processors potential liability for tickets purchased with Visa       or MasterCard which have not yet been used for travel (the unflown ticket       liability). We estimate that the Cash Reserve, which adjusts daily, will range       between $450 million and $1.1 billion during the term of the Processing       Agreement. The Processing Agreement allows us to substitute the Merrill Lynch       Letter of Credit for a portion of the Cash Reserve equal to the lesser of $300       million and 45% of the unflown ticket liability. See Note 2 for additional       information about our reclassification of the change in Cash Reserve on our       Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The       Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit may only be drawn upon following certain events       as described in the Processing Agreement. In addition, the Processor must first       apply both the portion of the Cash Reserve that the Processor will continue       to       hold and any offsets from collections by the Processor before drawing on the       Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit to cover fare refunds paid to passengers by       the       Processor.
Our       obligation to reimburse Merrill Lynch under the Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit       for any draws made by the Processor is not secured and will constitute a       super-priority administrative expense claim that is subject to certain other       claims, including our post-petition financing. The Merrill Lynch Letter of       Credit was originally due to expire on January 21, 2008. In July 2006, with       the       approval of the Bankruptcy Court, we amended the Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit       to, among other matters, extend the expiration date to September 14, 2008 and       to       reduce the fees payable by us. The Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit will renew       automatically for one-year periods after September 14, 2008 unless Merrill       Lynch       notifies the Processor 420 days prior to the applicable expiration date that       it       will not renew the Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit.
F-35 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Bombardier       Agreement During       the June 2006 quarter, Comair, Bombardier, Inc. (Bombardier) and a subsidiary       of Bombardier completed, with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, an agreement       under which, among other things, (1) Comair surrendered a letter of credit       supporting certain reimbursement obligationsowed by Bombardier to Comair,       which were simultaneously released by Comairand (2) Bombardier transferred       to Comair $171 million aggregate principal amount of secured notes issued to       Bombardier by Delta. The transfer of the secured notes constitutes an       extinguishment of debt under SFAS No. 140, Accounting for the Transfer and       Services of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. We recognized a       $26 million gain as a result of this extinguishment of debt, which is classified       in reorganization items, net.
Covenants As       discussed above, the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility and the Amex       Post-Petition Facility include certain affirmative, negative and financial       covenants. In addition, as is customary in the airline industry, our aircraft       lease and financing agreements require that we maintain certain levels of       insurance coverage, including war-risk insurance. Failure to maintain these       coverages may result in an interruption to our operations. See Note 8 for       additional information about our war-risk insurance currently provided by the       U.S. government.
We       were       in compliance with these covenant requirements at December 31, 2006 and       2005.
Exit       Financing On       January 29, 2007, we secured commitments for a $2.5 billion exit financing       facility (the Exit Facility) to be used in connection with our plan to exit       bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2007. The Exit Facility will be co-led       by a       syndicate of six lenders and will consist of a $1.0 billion first-lien revolving       credit facility, a $500 million first-lien Term Loan A and a $1.0 billion       second-lien Term Loan B. Proceeds from the Exit Facility will be used to repay       the outstanding principal amounts of $1.9 billion and $176 million, together       with interest thereon and all other amounts outstanding thereunder, for the       Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility and the Amex Post-Petition Facility,       respectively. The Exit Facility will be secured by substantially all of the       first priority collateral in the existing Amended and Restated DIP Credit       Facility.
The       scheduled maturity date for the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan       A       will be the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Exit Facility. The       scheduled maturity date for the Term Loan B will be the seventh anniversary       of       the closing date of the closing of the Exit Facility.
The       Exit       Facility will contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain       a       minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, minimum unrestricted cash reserves and       minimum collateral coverage ratios. In addition, the Exit Facility will restrict       our ability to, among other things, incur additional secured indebtedness,       make       investments, sell assets if not in compliance with the collateral coverage       ratio       tests, pay dividends or repurchase stock. These covenants may have a material       impact on our operations.
The       closing and funding of the Exit Facility is subject to the completion of       definitive documentation and certain other conditions precedent.
Note       7. Lease Obligations We       lease       aircraft, airport terminals and maintenance facilities, ticket offices and       other       property and equipment from third parties. As allowed under Section 365 and       other relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume       and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases,       including leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to       the       approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions, including       compliance with Section 1110.
Rental       expense for operating leases, which is recorded on a straight-line basis over       the life of the lease term, totaled $945 million, $1.1 billion, and $1.3 billion       for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Amounts       due       under capital leases are recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance       Sheets. Our interest in assets acquired under capital leases is recorded as       property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of       assets recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation and       amortization expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our leases       do       not include residual value guarantees.
F-36 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       following tables summarize, as of December 31, 2006, our minimum rental       commitments under capital leases and noncancelable operating leases (including       certain aircraft under contract carrier agreements) with initial terms in excess       of one year: Capital       Leases Years                 Ending December 31, (in                 millions) Not                 Subject to Compromise Subject                 to Compromise Total 2007 $ 104 $ 6 $ 110 2008 100 3 103 2009 99  99 2010 99  99 2011 94  94 After                 2011 94  94 Total                 minimum lease payments 590 9 599 Less:                 amount of lease payments representing interest 266 1 267 Present                 value of future minimum capital lease payments 324 8 332 Less:                 current obligations under capital leases 37 5 42 Long-term                 capital lease obligations $ 287 $ 3 $ 290 Operating       Leases Years                 Ending December 31, (in                 millions) Delta Lease Payments Contract                 Carrier Agreements Lease                 Payments (1) Total 2007 $ 871 $ 386 $ 1,257 2008 798 384 1,182 2009 652 325 977 2010 590 325 915 2011 467 325 792 After                 2011 2,607 2,308 4,915 Total                 minimum lease payments $ 5,985 $ 4,053 $ 10,038 (1) Emerging                 Issues Task Force 01-08, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a                 Lease, provides guidance on whether an arrangement contains a lease                 within the scope of SFAS 13 and is applicable to agreements entered                 into                 or modified after June 30, 2003. Because we entered into our contract                 carrier agreement with Chautauqua prior to June 30, 2003, payments                 totaling $183 million related to Chautauqua aircraft are not included                 in                 the table.
At       December 31, 2006, we operated 166 aircraft under operating leases and 65       aircraft under capital leases. These leases have remaining terms ranging from       10       months tonine years. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded       estimated claims relating to the restructuring of the financing arrangements       of       188 aircraft and the rejection of 16 leases. Many of these transactions are       subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.
Note       8. Purchase Commitments and Contingencies Aircraft       Order Commitments Future       commitments for aircraft on firm order as of December 31, 2006 are estimated       to       be $3.0 billion. The following table shows the timing of these       commitments: Years                 Ending December 31, (in                 millions) 2007 $ 523 2008 823 2009 960 2010 712 Total $ 3,018 F-37 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Our       aircraft order commitments as of December 31, 2006 consist of firm orders to       purchase five B-777-200LR aircraft, 10 B-737-700 aircraft and 50 B-737-800       aircraft, including 48 B-737-800 aircraft, which we have entered into definitive       agreements to sell to third parties immediately following delivery of these       aircraft to us by the manufacturer starting in 2007. These sales will reduce       our       future commitments by approximately $2.0 billion during the period 2007 through       2010.
On       January 31, 2007, we entered into an agreement to purchase 30 CRJ-900 aircraft       from Bombardier Inc., with options to acquire an additional 30 CRJ-900 aircraft.       The aircraft will be delivered in two-class, 76 seat configuration between       September 2007 and February 2010. We expect these aircraft will be       operated by regional air carriers under contract carrier agreements, and the       purchase agreement permits assignment of the aircraft and related support       provisions to other carriers. We have available to us long-term, secured       financing commitments to fund a substantial portion of the aircraft purchase       price for the 30 firm orders.
We       have       signed a letter of intent with a third party to lease 10 B-757-200ER aircraft.       These aircraft will be delivered from July 2007 through November 2007 and will       be leased for seven years and three months each. We have also signed a letter       of       intent with a separate third party to lease three B-757-200ER aircraft which       would be delivered to us in the first quarter of 2008, or such earlier dates       as       the parties may agree, and will be leased for five years.
Contract       Carrier Agreements Delta       Connection Carriers As       of       December 31, 2006, we had contract carrier agreements with seven regional air       carriers (Connection Carriers), including our wholly owned subsidiary, Comair,       and six unaffiliated carriers. Except for the agreement with American Eagle       Airlines, Inc (Eagle) discussed below, the regional air carriers operate some       or all of their aircraft using our flight code, and we schedule those aircraft,       sell the seats on those flights and retain the related revenues. We pay those       airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based       on a       determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors       intended to approximate market rates for those services.
During       the year ended December 31, 2006, the following five carriers operated as       contract carriers (in addition to Comair) pursuant to agreements under which       we       pay amounts based on a determination of the costs of operating these flights       and       other factors. The following table shows the maximum number of aircraft to       be       operated for us under, and the expiration date of, our contract carrier       agreements with each of these carriers: Carrier (1) Maximum Number                 of Aircraft                 to be Operated                 Under Agreement (1)(2) Expiration Date of Agreement ASA (2) 161 2020 SkyWest                 Airlines (2) 98 2020 Chautauqua 39 2016 Freedom 42 2017 Shuttle                 America 16 2019 (1) The                 table does not include information regarding Eagle because our agreement                 with Eagle is structured as a revenue proration arrangement which                 establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for                 tickets                 sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight                 itineraries.
(2) In                     our Chapter 11 proceedings, we assumed our obligations under                     the contract                     carrier agreements with ASA and SkyWest Airlines. Accordingly,                     these                     agreements are not subject to rejection pursuant to Section 365                     of the                     Bankruptcy Code.
F-38 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       following table shows the available seat miles (ASMs) and revenue passenger       miles (RPMs) operated for us under contract carrier agreements with       unaffiliated regional air carriers:  SkyWest                 Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest Airlines) and Chautauqua for all periods                 presented;  Shuttle                 America for the year ended December 31, 2006 and from September 1                 through                 December 31, 2005;  ASA                 for the year ended December 31, 2006 and from September 8 through                 December                 31, 2005. On September 7, 2005, we sold ASA to SkyWest, Inc. (SkyWest);                 and  Freedom                 Airlines, Inc. (Freedom) for the year ended December 31, 2006 and from                 October 1 to December 31, 2005.
(in                 millions, except for number of aircraft operated) , unaudited 2006 2005 ASMs 15,390 8,275 RPMs 11,931 5,961 Number                 of aircraft operated, end of period 324 265 Contingencies       Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements We       may       terminate the Chautauqua and Shuttle America agreements without cause at any       time after May 2010 and January 2013, respectively, by providing certain advance       notice. If we terminate either the Chautauqua or Shuttle America agreements       without cause, Chautauqua or Shuttle America, respectively, has the right to       (1)       assign to us leased aircraft that the airline operates for us, provided we       are       able to continue the leases on the same terms the airline had prior to the       assignment and (2) require us to purchase or lease any of the aircraft that       the       airline owns and operates for us at the time of the termination. If we are       required to purchase aircraft owned by Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the       purchase price would be equal to the amount necessary to (1) reimburse       Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the equity it provided to purchase the       aircraft and (2) repay in full any debt outstanding at such time that is not       being assumed in connection with such purchase. If we are required to lease       aircraft owned by Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the lease would have (1) a       rate       equal to the debt payments of Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the debt       financing of the aircraft calculated as if 90% of the aircraft was debt financed       by Chautauqua or Shuttle America and (2) other specified terms and       conditions.
We       estimate that the total fair values, determined as of December 31, 2006, of       the       aircraft that Chautauqua or Shuttle America could assign to us or require that       we purchase if we terminate without cause our contract carrier agreements with       those airlines (the P ut Right  ) are       $483       million and $367 million, respectively. The actual amount that we may be       required to pay in these circumstances may be materially different from these       estimates.If the Chautauquaor Shuttle America Put       Rightis exercised,we must also payto the exercising       carrier10% interest (compounded monthly)on the equity the carrier       provided whenit purchased the put aircraft.These equity       amounts for Chautaqua and Shuttle America total $56 million and $34 million,       respectively.
Legal       Contingencies We       are       involved in various legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters, employment       practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business.       We       cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings       because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff       does not specify the damages being sought. As a result of our Chapter 11       proceedings, virtually all pre-petition pending litigation against us is stayed       and related amounts accrued have been classified in liabilities subject to       compromise on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and       2005.
Comair       Flight 5191 On       August       27, 2006, Comair Flight 5191 crashed shortly after take-off in a field near       the       Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Kentucky. All 47 passengers and two members       of       the flight crew died in the accident. The third crew member       survived with severe injuries. Lawsuits arising out of this accident have been       filed against our wholly owned subsidiary, Comair, on behalf of at least 36       of       the passengers, includinga number of lawsuits that also name Delta as a       defendant. Additional lawsuits are anticipated. These lawsuits, which are in       preliminary stages, generally assert claims for wrongful death and related       personal injuries, and seek unspecified damages, including punitive damages       in       most cases. All butfour of the lawsuits filed to date have been filed       either in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, or       in       state court in Fayette County, Kentucky. The cases filed in state court in       Kentucky have been orare expected tobe removed to federal court. One       lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District       of       New York,one lawsuit has been filed in state court in Broward County,       Florida and two lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court for the       District of Kansas. The federal court in New York has ordered the case filed       there to be transferred to the federal court in Kentucky. The Debtors motion is       currently pending in federal court in Florida to transfer the case filed in       Florida to the federal court in Kentucky. The Debtors are also seeking to       transfer the lawsuits filed in Kansas to the federal court in Kentucky. Those       matters pending in the Eastern District of Kentucky have been consolidated       as In Re Air Crash at Lexington, Kentucky, August 27, 2006, Master File No.       5:06-CV-316.
F-39 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) In       addition, Comair has filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern       District of Kentucky against theUnited States(based on the actions       of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)), the Lexington Airport Board and       certain other Lexington airport defendants, seeking to apportion potential       liability for damages arising from this accident among all responsible       parties.
During       the September 2006 quarter, we recorded a long term liability with a       corresponding long term receivable from our insurance carriers in other       noncurrent liabilities and assets, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance       Sheet relating to the Comair Flight 5191 accident. These estimates may be       revised as additional information becomes available. We carry aviation risk       liability insurance and believe this insurance is sufficient to cover any       liability likely to arise from this accident.
Other       Contingencies Regional       Airports Improvement Corporation (RAIC) We       have       obligations under a facilities agreement with the RAIC to pay the bond trustee       amounts sufficient to pay the debt service on $47 million in Facilities Sublease       Refunding Revenue Bonds. These bonds were issued in 1996 to refinance bonds       that       financed the construction of certain airport and terminal facilities we use       at       Los Angeles International Airport. We also provide a guarantee to the bond       trustee covering payment of the debt service.
General       Indemnifications We       are       the lessee under many commercial real estate leases. It is common in these       transactions for us, as the lessee, to agree to indemnify the lessor and the       lessors related parties for tort, environmental and other liabilities that       arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises. This       type       of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for       liabilities arising out of the conduct of, among others, contractors, licensees       and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased       premises. This indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from       the       negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities       caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful       misconduct.
Our       aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements typically contain       provisions requiring us, as the lessee or obligor, to indemnify the other       parties to those agreements, including certain of those parties related       persons, against virtually any liabilities that might arise from the condition,       use or operation of the aircraft or such other equipment.
We       believe that our insurance would cover most of our exposure to such liabilities       and related indemnities associated with the types of lease and financing       agreements described above, including real estate leases. However, our insurance       does not typically cover environmental liabilities, although we have certain       policies in place to meet the requirements of applicable environmental       laws.
F-40 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Certain       of our aircraft and other financing transactions include provisions which       require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the       lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law       or       regulations. In certain of these financing transactions, we also bear the risk       of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to non-U.S. lenders       to withholding taxes.
We       cannot       reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and       related provisions described above because we cannot predict (1) when and under       what circumstances these provisions may be triggered and (2) the amount that       would be payable if the provisions were triggered because the amounts would       be       based on facts and circumstances existing at such time. We also cannot predict       the impact, if any, that our Chapter 11 proceedings might have on these       obligations.
Employees       Under Collective Bargaining Agreements At       December 31, 2006, we had a total of approximately 51,300 full-time equivalent       employees. Approximately 17% of these employees, including all of our pilots,       are represented by labor unions. For additional information related to our       collective bargaining agreements, see Note 1.
War-Risk       Insurance Contingency As       a       result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers       significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to       commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than employees or       passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events.       At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for       such coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001,       the U.S. government has been providingU.S. airlines with war-risk       insurance to cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to       passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coverage       currently extends to August 31, 2007. The withdrawalof       governmentsupport of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain       war-risk insurance coverage commercially, if available. Such commercial       insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than currently       provided by the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of       loss       from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material increase to our       operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all, resulting in       aninterruption to our operations.
Fuel       Inventory Supply Agreement On       August       31, 2006, we entered into an agreement with J. Aron & Company (Aron), an       affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co., pursuant to which Aron became the       exclusive jet fuel supplier for our operations at the Atlanta airport, the       Cincinnati airport and the three major airports in the New York City area.       In       accordance with this agreement, on September 6, 2006, we sold to Aron, at then       current market prices, (1) all jet fuel inventory that we were then holding       in       storage at facilities that support our operations at the airports in Atlanta       and       Cincinnati and (2) all jet fuel inventory that was in transit to these airports       as well as to the three major New York City area airports. We received       approximately $102 million from this sale. In addition, for the duration of       the       agreement, we (1) assigned to Aron certain existing supply agreements with       our       third party suppliers for jet fuel for these locations, (2) transferred to       Aron       the right to use our storage facilities in Atlanta and Cincinnati and (3)       transferred to Aron allocations in pipeline systems through which jet fuel       is       delivered to storage facilities for the Atlanta airport, the Cincinnati airport       and the three New York City area airports. The initial sale of our jet fuel       inventory did not have a material impact on ourConsolidated Statement of       Operations. The agreement with Aron has six-month terms that automatically       renew       unless terminated by either party thirty days prior to the end of any six-month       period, and the agreement will terminate on its third anniversary. Upon       termination of the agreement, we will be required to purchase, at market prices       at the time of termination, all jet fuel inventory that Aron is holding in       the       storage facilities that support our operations at the Atlanta and Cincinnati       airports and all jet fuel inventory that is in transit to these airports as       well       as to the three New York City area airports. At termination of the agreement,       Aron will return to us our rights to use the storage facilities in Atlanta       and       Cincinnati and our allocations in pipeline systems.
Other We       have       certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty,       acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as       defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause       prior to its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our       termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no       obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs. We also cannot predict       the impact, if any, that our Chapter 11 proceedings might have on these       obligations.
F-41 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Note       9. Income Taxes Deferred       income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the       carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes       and       income tax purposes (see Note 2 for information about our accounting policy       for       income taxes). The following table shows significant components of our deferred       tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005: (in                 millions) 2006 2005 Deferred                 tax assets: Net                 operating loss carryforwards $ 2,921 $ 3,246 Additional                 minimum pension liability (see Note 10) 615 1,565 Postretirement                 benefits 681 716 Other                 employee benefits 2,898 992 AMT                 credit carryforward 346 346 Rent                 expense 1,215 398 Other 598 757 Valuation                 allowance (5,169 ) (3,954 ) Total                 deferred tax assets $ 4,105 $ 4,066 Deferred                 tax liabilities: Depreciation                 and amortization $ 3,850 $ 3,763 Other 259 336 Total                 deferred tax liabilities $ 4,109 $ 4,099 The       following table shows the current and noncurrent deferred tax (liabilities)       assets, recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and       2005: (in                 millions) 2006 2005 Current                 deferred tax assets, net $ 402 $ 99 Noncurrent                 deferred tax liabilities, net (406 ) (132 ) Total                 deferred tax liabilities, net $ (4 ) $ (33 ) The       current and noncurrent components of our deferred tax balances are generally       based on the balance sheet classification of the asset or liability creating       the       temporary difference. If the deferred tax asset or liability is not based on       a       component of our balance sheet, such as our net operating loss (NOL)       carryforwards, the classification is presented based on the expected reversal       date of the temporary difference. Our valuation allowance has been classified       as       current or noncurrent based on the percentages of current and noncurrent       deferred tax assets to total deferred tax assets.
At       December 31, 2006, we had (1) $346 million of federal alternative minimum tax       (AMT) credit carryforwards, which do not expire and (2) approximately $7.8       billion of federal and state pretax NOL carryforwards, substantially all of       which will not begin to expire until 2022. Our ability to utilize our AMT and       NOL carryforwards will be subject to significant limitation if, as a result       of       our Chapter 11 proceedings, we undergo an ownership change for purposes of       Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For additional       information about the Bankruptcy Courts order designed to assist us in       preserving our NOLs, see Note 1.
F-42 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Valuation       Allowance SFAS       109       requires us to periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that       we       will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax       assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and       negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things,       our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical       earnings and losses, our industrys historically cyclical periods of earnings       and losses and our outlook for future years.
For       the       year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $765       million. This amount primarily reflects adjustments to our valuation allowance       from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the       derecognition of previously recorded Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified plan       obligations upon each plans termination. For additional information regarding       the termination of the Pilot Plan, see Note 10.
In       the       June 2004 quarter, we determined that it was unclear as to the timing of when       we       will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.       Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an additional       valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which resulted       in a       $1.2 billion income tax provision on our 2004 Consolidated Statement of       Operations. Until we determine it is more likely than not that we will generate       sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, income       tax       benefits associated with current period losses will be fully       reserved.
Our       income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,       and       2004 consisted of: (in                 millions) 2006 2005 2004 Current                 tax benefit (provision) $ 17 $ (9 ) $  Deferred                 tax benefit (exclusive of the other components listed                 below) 2,364 1,464 1,139 Increase                 in valuation allowance (1,616 ) (1,414 ) (2,345 ) Income                 tax benefit (provision) $ 765 $ 41 $ (1,206 ) The       following table presents the principal reasons for the difference between the       effective tax rate and the United States federal statutory income tax rate       for       2006, 2005, and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 U.S.                 federal statutory income tax rate (35.0 )% (35.0 )% (35.0 )% State                 taxes, net of federal income tax effect (2.5 ) (3.3 ) (1.5 ) Goodwill                 impairment   7.5 Increase                 in valuation allowance 23.2 36.6 58.8 Other,                 net 3.3 0.6 0.4 Effective                 income tax rate (11.0 )% (1.1 )% 30.2 % Note       10. Employee Benefit Plans We       sponsor qualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans,       healthcare plans, and disability and survivorship plans for eligible employees       and retirees, and their eligible family members. We sponsored the Pilot Plan       and       non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for our pilots prior to the       termination of these plans as discussed below.
We       also       sponsor non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for eligible non-pilot       employees. Almost all pension benefits under these plans accrued prior to our       Chapter 11 filing and, because we did not seek authority from the Bankruptcy       Court to pay those pre-petition benefits, we are precluded from doing so during       the Chapter 11 proceedings. We intend to reject these plans in our Plan of       Reorganization. As a result, no further benefits will be paid from these       non-qualified plans.
We       regularly evaluate ways to better manage our employee benefits and control       costs. We reserve the right to modify or terminate our benefit plans as to       all       participants and beneficiaries at any time, except as restricted by the Internal       Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and our       collective bargaining agreements. Any changes to the plans or assumptions used       to estimate future benefits could have a significant effect on the amount of       the       reported obligation and future annual expense.
F-43 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Significant       Events in 2006 ALPA       Agreement In       June       2006, we reached a comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing Deltas pilot       labor costs. The agreement, among other things:  amended                 our postretirement healthcare plan for pilots (1) to increase healthcare                 premiums for pilots who retire after June 1, 2006 and their survivors                 prior to age 65 and (2) to provide that pilots who retire after June                 1,                 2006 are not eligible for our subsidized post-age 65 healthcare coverage.                 This amendment was accounted for as a negative plan amendment under                 SFAS                 No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than                 Pensions (SFAS 106). It reduced the accumulated plan benefit obligation                 (APBO) for this plan by $63                 million.
amended                 our disability and survivorship plan for pilots (Pilot D&S Plan) to                 replace survivor benefits and basic life insurance coverage with                 term life                 insurance for pilots who retire on or after January 1, 2008. This                 amendment reduced the APBO for the Pilot D&S Plan by $65                 million.
provided                 that ALPA would not oppose the termination of the Pilot Plan and                 that the                 non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for pilots would be terminated                 if the Pilot Plan was terminated. The Pilot Plan and these non-qualified                 plans were terminated effective September 2,                 2006.
changed                 our contribution to the Delta Pilots Defined Contribution Plan to                 9% of                 covered pay for all pilots, effective upon termination of the Pilot                 Plan.                 Prior to this change, pilots received a contribution between zero                 and 23%                 of covered pay, based on the pilots age and years of service on January                 1, 2005.
For       additional information regarding our comprehensive agreement with ALPA, see       Collective Bargaining Agreements in Note 1.
1114       Committee Agreements In       October 2006, we and the two separate retiree committees appointed under Section       1114 of the Bankruptcy Code reached agreements (1114 Agreements) which       modified our postretirement benefit plan obligations by, among other things,       increasing the current retirees share of healthcare costs. The 1114 Agreements       also eliminate Deltas current post-age 65 coverage for non-pilot retirees, but       provide a subsidy for certain non-pilot retirees that can be applied to       alternative coverage to be made available through the 1114 non-pilot retiree       committee. The 1114 Agreements provided retirees an allowed general, unsecured       pre-petition claim of $539 million, which was recorded in reorganization items,       net with a corresponding offset in liabilities subject to compromise. The       amendment of our postretirement plans reduces participant benefits and is       accounted for as a negative plan amendment under SFAS 106, reducing the APBO       for       these plans by $796 million. For additional information regarding these retiree       committees, see Payment of Insurance Benefits to Retired Employees in Note       1.
Termination       of Pilot Plan and PBGC Settlement Agreement In       June       2006, we sent to participants and beneficiaries a Notice of Intent to Terminate       the Pilot Plan effective September 2, 2006. In September, the Bankruptcy Court       found that we met the financial requirements for a distress termination of       the       Pilot Plan and, in December 2006, we reached a comprehensive settlement       agreement (the PBGC Settlement Agreement) with the PBGC providing for such       termination. In accordance with the PBGC Settlement Agreement, the PBGC became       trustee of the Pilot Plan effective December 31, 2006, and the effective date       of       the termination of the Pilot Plan was deemed to be September 2, 2006.
Pursuant       to the PBGC Settlement Agreement, the PBGC received an allowed general,       unsecured pre-petition claim against each of the Debtors in the amount of $2.2       billion, but recoverable solely against Delta (PBGC Claim).       The PBGC Settlement Agreement also provided for the distribution to the PBGC       of       senior unsecured notes (the PBGC Notes) in aggregate principal amount of $225       million, a term of up to 15 years and an annual interest rate calculated to       ensure that the notes trade at par on the issuance date. We may replace all       or a       portion of the principal amount of the PBGC Notes with cash prior to the       issuance, which we are required to do under certain circumstances. We also       agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement in connection with the       PBGC       Settlement Agreement.
F-44 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Some       of       the other significant terms of the PBGC Settlement Agreement include:  as                 of the date we emerge from Chapter 11, the PBGC has agreed to irrevocably                 waive its rights to restore the Pilot Plan in full or in part;  we                 have agreed not to establish any new qualified defined benefit plans                 for                 pilots for a period of five years after we emerge from Chapter 11;  t he                 parties agree to take steps to protect our net operating loss carryforward                 tax benefits;  absent                 extraordinary unanticipated circumstances we will (a) elect the                 alternative funding schedule under section 402(a)(1) of the pension                 reform                 legislation (Pension Protection Act) with respect to the qualified                 defined benefit pension plan for non-pilot employees (Non-pilot Plan);                 (b) not seek a distress termination of the Non-pilot Plan; and (c)                 provide                 in our reorganization plan that we shall continue the Non-pilot Plan;                 and  we                 confirmed our previously stated intention reached independently of                 the                 PBGC Settlement Agreement that we would make a contribution to the                 Non-Pilot Plan of not less than $50 million minus any amounts contributed                 to such plan subsequent to our election of Airline Relief under the                 Pension Protection Act and prior to our emergence from Chapter 11.
Consistent       with the ALPA Agreement, we also terminated the pilot non-qualified plans as       of       September 2, 2006. As a result of the termination of the non-qualified plans,       retired pilots who were receiving non-qualified benefits received an $801       million allowed general, unsecured pre-petition claim and a $9 million       administrative claim. As a result of the termination of both the Pilot Plan       and       the non-qualified plans, we recorded a settlement gain of $1.3 billion in       reorganization items, net, derecognizing the accrued pension liability and       reversed the related $2.2 billion additional minimum liability to other       comprehensive loss. Additionally, the $2.2 billion claim for the PBGC and the       $810 million in total claims for the retired pilots were recorded in       reorganization items, net with a corresponding offset in liabilities subject       to       compromise. The $3.5 billion reversal of the pension liability and the recording       of the $3.0 billion in claims resulted in a net reduction of $490 million in       liabilities subject to compromise.
Claims       associated with changes made in the Chapter 11 reorganization and obligations       related to our defined benefit plans, other postretirement benefit plans, and       certain postemployment benefits have been classified as liabilities subject       to       compromise, as these obligations may be impacted by our Chapter 11 proceedings.       For additional information, see Liabilities Subject to Compromise in Note       1.
Adoption       of SFAS 158 On       December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of       SFAS       158. SFAS 158 requires that we recognize the funded status of our defined       benefit pension plans, other postretirement plans, and certain of our       postemployment plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006,       with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net       of       tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption       represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service       costs and credits, which were previously netted against the plans funded status       in our Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 87,       Employers Accounting for Pension (SFAS 87) and SFAS 106. These amounts will       be subsequently recognized as net periodic (benefit) cost pursuant to our       accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. Actuarial gains and losses that       arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic (benefit)       cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other       comprehensive loss. These gains and losses will be subsequently recognized       as a       component of net periodic (benefit) cost on the same basis as the amounts       recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption of SFAS       158.
F-45 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       incremental effects of adopting SFAS 158 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet       at       December 31, 2006 are presented in the following table.

We continue       to       measure our benefit plans with a September 30 measurement date.
Defined       Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit       Plans Defined       Benefit Pension Plans.
Prior to       the events described above, we sponsored both funded and nonfunded       noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that covered substantially all       of       our employees. Currently, we sponsor the Non-pilot Plan and a separate frozen       qualified defined benefit plan for certain pilots formerly employed by Western       Air Lines (Western Plan). Effective December 31, 2005, future pay and service       accruals under the Non-pilot Plan were frozen. The Non-pilot Plan provides       a       retirement benefit based on a combination of a final average earnings formula       and a cash balance formula, subject to the terms of that plan .       Under       our settlement agreement with the PBGC, we agreed to initiate, prior to our       emergence from Chapter 11, a standard termination of the Western Plan. Assuming       current funding rules and current plan design, we estimate that the funding       requirements under our Non-pilot Plan will be approximately $100 million in       2007.
Postretirement       Healthcare Plans .       We also       sponsor healthcare plans that provide benefits to substantially all Delta       retirees and their eligible dependents who are under age 65. Benefits under       these plans are funded from our current assets and are subject to co-payments,       deductibles and other limits as described in the plans. Non-pilot employees       are       not eligible for company provided post-retirement healthcare coverage after       age       65, except for those retirees eligible for a subsidy to be applied to       alternative coverage available through the 1114 non-pilot retiree committee.       Pilots who retire after June 1, 2006 are not eligible for subsidized post-age       65       healthcare coverage although they may purchase such coverage at full       cost.
Postemployment       Plans.
We       provide certain other welfare benefits to eligible former or inactive employees       after employment, but before retirement, primarily as part of the disability       and       survivorship plans. These disability and survivorship plans provide benefits       to       substantially all Delta employees as a result of a participants death or       disability. As discussed above, survivor benefits have been replaced with term       life insurance coverage for pilots retiring on or after January 1, 2008.       Additionally, survivor benefits will not be paid for non-pilot employees who       die       or retire after July 1, 2010.

The $859 million decrease in       other postretirement benefit obligation and the $65 million decrease in other       postemployment benefit obligation are related to plan amendments resulting       from       the 1114 Agreements and the ALPA agreement.
In       2005,       the $1.3 billion increase in our pension benefit obligation due to actuarial       losses primarily relates to (1) changes in our discount rate and participant       life expectancy assumptions used to measure the obligation and (2) the large       number of early pilot retirements and related lump sum distributions from plan       assets. The $320 million increase due to curtailment losses relates to (1)       the       combined impact on the Non-pilot Plan of an early retirement window offered       to       certain non-pilot employees in late 2004 and other components of our       transformation plan announced in 2004 and (2) the amendment of the Pilot Plan       to       freeze service accruals effective December 31, 2004. The $51 million decrease       in       the other postretirement benefit obligation due to plan amendments relates       to       the elimination of company subsidized post-age 65 healthcare coverage for pilots       hired after November 11, 2004.

During       2005 and 2004, we recorded settlement charges totaling $388 million and $257       million, respectively, on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. These       charges primarily related to the Pilot Plan and resulted from lump sum       distributions to pilots who retired.
During       2005, we recorded a net curtailment loss of $434 million on our Consolidated       Statement of Operations. The $434 million net curtailment loss consists of       (1) a       $13 million curtailment gain recorded in the December 2005 quarter related       to       the freeze of benefit accruals effective December 31, 2005 for the Non-pilot       Plan and (2) a curtailment loss of $447 million related to the impact of the       reduction of non-pilot jobs announced in November 2004 and the freeze of service       accruals under the Pilot Plan effective December 31, 2004. Additionally, in       the       December 2004 quarter, we recorded a $527 million curtailment gain related       to       the elimination of subsidized retiree medical benefits for eligible employees       who retire after January 1, 2006.
Assumptions We       used       the following actuarial assumptions to determine our benefit obligations at       September 30, 2006 and 2005 and our net periodic (benefit) cost for the years       presented, as measured at September 30: Benefit                   Obligations (1) 2006 2005 Weighted                   average discount rate 5.88 % 5.69 % Rate                   of increase in future compensation levels 0.36 % 0.72 % Assumed                   healthcare cost trend rate (2) 8.50 % 9.50 % Net                   Periodic Benefit Cost (3) 2006 2005 2004 Weighted                   average discount rate  pension benefit 5.67 % 5.81 % 6.09 % Weighted                   average discount rate  other postretirement benefit 5.65 % 6.10 % 6.05 % Weighted                   average discount rate  other postemployment benefit 5.72 % 6.10 % 6.13 % Rate                   of increase (decrease) in future compensation levels 0.72 % (1.28 )% 1.89 % Expected                   long-term rate of return on plan assets 9.00 % 9.00 % 9.00 % Assumed                   healthcare cost trend rate (2) 9.50 % 9.50 % 9.00 % (1) Our                 2006 and 2005 benefit obligations are measured using the RP 2000                 combined                 healthy mortality table projected to                 2006.
(2) The                 assumed healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decline gradually                 to                 5.00% by 2010 for health plan costs and remain level                 thereafter.
(3) Our                 2006, 2005, and 2004 assumptions reflect various remeasurements of                 certain                 portions of our obligations and represent the weighted average of                 the                 assumptions used for each measurement date.
The       expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets was based on plan-specific       investment studies performed by outside consultants who used historical market       return and volatility data with forward looking estimates based on existing       financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return expectations       versus some market indices were incorporated into the return projections based       on the actively managed structure of our investment program and its record       of       achieving such returns historically.
Assumed       healthcare cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the       other       postretirement benefit plans. A 1% change in the healthcare cost trend rate       used       in measuring the APBO for these plans at September 30, 2006, would have the       following effects: (in                 millions) 1%                 Increase 1%                 Decrease Increase                 (decrease) in total service and interest cost $ 9 $ (7 ) Increase                 (decrease) in the APBO 28 (48 ) F-50 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Pension       Plan Assets The       weighted-average asset allocation for our pension plans at September 30, 2006       and 2005 is as follows: 2006 2005 U.S.                 equity securities 34% 36% Non-U.S.                 equity securities 14% 13% High                 quality bonds 18% 19% Convertible                 and high yield bonds 8% 8% Private                 equity 17% 15% Real                 estate 9% 9% Total 100% 100% The       investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix       of       global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income       portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn       a       long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target.       The overall asset mix of the portfolio is more heavily weighted in equity-like       investments, including portions of the bond portfolio, which consist of       convertible and high yield securities. Active management strategies are utilized       throughout the program in an effort to realize investment returns in excess       of       market indices. Also, option and currency overlay strategies are used in an       effort to generate modest amounts of additional income. A bond duration       extension program utilizing fixed income derivatives is employed in an effort       to       better align the market value movements of a portion of the pension plan assets       to the related pension plan liabilities.
Target       investment allocations for the pension plan assets are as       follows: U.S.                 equity securities 27-41% Non-U.S.                 equity securities 12-18% High                 quality bonds 15-21% Convertible                 and high yield bonds 5-11% Private                 equity 15% Real                 estate 10% Benefit       Payments Benefit       payments in the table below are based on the same assumptions used to measure       the related benefit obligations and are paid from both funded benefit plan       trusts and current assets. Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from       these estimates. As the result of the Chapter 11 filing, benefits earned under       our non-qualified defined benefit plans will not be paid, and are not included       in the table below. Benefits earned under our qualified pension plans and other       postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid from funded benefit plan       trusts, while our other postretirement benefits are funded from current assets.
F-51 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2006 the benefit payments, which       reflect expected service, as appropriate, that are scheduled to be paid in       the       following years ending December 31: (in                 millions) Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits Other Postemployment Benefits 2007 $ 472 $ 106 $ 140 2008 462 109 146 2009 451 111 153 2010 444 107 160 2011 439 102 166 2012                  2016 2,240 408 925 Total $ 4,508 $ 943 $ 1,690 Other       Plans We       also       sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible Delta employees in certain       foreign countries. These plans did not have a material impact on our       Consolidated Financial Statements in any period presented.
Defined       Contribution Pension Plans Delta       Family-Care Savings Plan (Savings Plan) Eligible       employees may contribute a portion of their covered pay to the Savings Plan.       Generally, we match 50% of non-pilot employee contributions with a maximum       employer contribution of 2% of a participants covered pay. In 2006 and 2005, we       provided all eligible Delta pilots with an employer contribution of 2% of their       covered pay. In 2004, the employer contribution for eligible Delta pilots was       3%       of their covered pay. Prior to the Petition Date, we generally made our       contributions for non-pilots and pilots by allocating Series B ESOP Convertible       Preferred Stock (ESOP Preferred Stock), common stock or cash to the Savings       Plan. Effective on the Petition Date, we began making all company contributions       to the Savings Plan in cash. Our contributions, which are recorded as salaries       and related costs on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, totaled $44       million, $56 million, and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,       2005 and 2004, respectively.
During       the March 2006 quarter, all remaining unallocated shares of ESOP Preferred       Stock       were allocated to participants in the Savings Plan and converted to common       stock. All of the common stock in the Savings Plan was then sold by the Plans       trustee. For additional information on our ESOP Preferred Stock and Common       Stock, see Note 12.
Pilot       Defined Contribution Plan We       established a defined contribution plan for Delta pilots effective January       1,       2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized expense       of       $71 million and $83 million, respectively, for this plan. Effective with the       termination of the Pilot Plan on September 2, 2006, eligible pilots received       a       contribution of 9% of covered pay.
Delta       Pilots Money Purchase Pension Plan (MPPP) Effective       June 30, 2006, the MPPP was terminated and the majority of assets were       distributed to the participants. Through December 31, 2004, we contributed       5% of       covered pay to the MPPP for each eligible Delta pilot. During the year ended       December 31, 2004, we recognized expense of $65 million for this plan.
Note       11. Sale of ASA On       September 7, 2005, we sold ASA, our wholly owned subsidiary, to SkyWest for       a       purchase price of $425 million. In conjunction with this transaction, we amended       our contract carrier agreements with ASA and SkyWest Airlines, a wholly owned       subsidiary of SkyWest, under which those regional airlines serve as Delta       Connection carriers. The sale of ASA resulted in an immaterial gain that is       being amortized over the life of our contract carrier agreement with ASA. For       additional information on our contract carrier agreements with ASA and SkyWest       Airlines, see Note 8.
F-52 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Our       sale       of ASA included the following major classes of assets and       liabilities: (in                 millions) September                 7, 2005 Assets : Current                 assets $ 153 Flight                 equipment, net 1,555 Other                 property and equipment, net 61 Other                 assets 33 Total                 assets $ 1,802 Liabilities : Current                 maturities of long-term debt $ 222 Other                 current liabilities 116 Long-term                 debt 1,002 Other                 noncurrent liabilities 8 Total                 liabilities $ 1,348 After       the       sale of ASA to SkyWest, the revenues and expenses related to our contract       carrier agreement with ASA are reported as regional affiliates passenger       revenues and contract carrier agreements, respectively, in our Consolidated       Statements of Operations. Prior to the sale, expenses related to ASA were       reported in the applicable expense line item in our Consolidated Statements       of       Operations.
Note       12. Common and Preferred Stock Stock       Option and Other Stock-Based Award Plans During       the year ended December 31, 2005, we distributed from treasury 38 million shares       of our common stock for redemptions of ESOP Preferred Stock under the Savings       Plan. We distributed these shares of common stock from treasury at an average       price that is lower than the average price we paid to purchase these shares.       As       a result, our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005 reflects a $1.8       billion decrease in treasury stock at cost, and a corresponding decrease in       additional paid-in-capital.
Prior       to       the Petition Date, we adopted certain plans which provide for the issuance       of       common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and for other       stock-based awards. Effective March 31, 2006 the Bankruptcy Court granted our       motion to reject substantially all of our then outstanding stock options. For       additional information related to stock-based compensation, see Note 2.
F-53 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The       following table summarizes all stock option activity for the years ended       December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 Shares (000) Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares (000) Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares (000) Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding                 at the beginning of the year 92,401 $ 16 105,933 $ 15 37,893 $ 31 Granted   1,939 5 70,763 6 Exercised     (3 ) 11 Forfeited   (15,471 ) 8 (2,720 ) 38 Rejected (92,086 ) 16     Outstanding                 at the end of the year 315 $ 16 92,401 $ 16 105,933 $ 15 Exercisable                 at the end of the year 315 $ 16 53,944 $ 22 33,337 $ 33 ESOP       Preferred Stock In       December 2005, we amended the Savings Plan to give eligible participants the       opportunity to receive an in-service distribution of the ESOP Preferred Stock       and common stock in their ESOP accounts in the Savings Plan. Under this       amendment, eligible participants could make an election between December 19,       2005 and January 18, 2006 to receive such an in-service distribution. Upon       its       distribution, the ESOP Preferred Stock was automatically converted in accordance       with its terms into shares of common stock. Subsequent to January 18, 2006,       the       trustee of the Savings Plan converted all the remaining shares of ESOP Preferred       Stock into common stock.
During       2006, all shares of ESOP Preferred Stock, which were not allocated to the       accounts of participants in the Savings Plan, were allocated to participants       in       that plan. All outstanding shares of ESOP Preferred Stock were then converted,       in accordance with their terms, into approximately eight million shares of       common stock from treasury at cost. The allocation and conversion of the ESOP       Preferred Stock resulted in a $367 million decrease from treasury stock at       cost       and a corresponding$144 million decreasein additional paid-in       capital. Unpaid dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock accrue without interest,       until paid, at a rate of $4.32 per share per year. At December 31, 2006 and       2005, accumulated but unpaid dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock totaled       $52       million and $50 million, respectively, and are recorded in liabilities subject       to compromise on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note       13. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive       loss primarily includes (1) our reported net loss, (2) changes in our additional       minimum pension liability, (3) changes in our deferred tax asset valuation       allowance related to our additional minimum pension liability and (4) changes       in       the effective portion of our open fuel hedge contracts which qualify for hedge       accounting.

For additional       information related to our fuel hedge contracts and our additional minimum       pension liability, see Notes 4 and 10, respectively.
Note       14. Geographic Information SFAS       No.       131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,       requires us to disclose certain information about our operating segments.       Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise with separate       financial information, which is evaluated regularly by the chief operating       decision-maker and is used in resource allocation and performance       assessments.
We       are       managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for       passengers and cargo. This allows us to benefit from an integrated revenue       pricing and route network that includes Mainline, Comair and our contract       carriers. The flight equipment of the carriers is combined to form one fleet,       which is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making resource       allocation decisions, our chief operating decision maker evaluates flight       profitability data, which considers aircraft type and route economics, but       gives       no weight to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision on an       individual carrier basis. Our objective in making resource allocation decisions       is to optimize our consolidated financial results.
F-55 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Operating       revenues are assigned to a specific geographic region based on the origin,       flight path and destination of each flight segment. Our operating revenues       by       geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are       summarized in the following table: (in                 millions) 2006 2005 2004 North                 America $ 12,931 $ 13,030 $ 12,389 Atlantic 2,997 2,255 2,088 Pacific 164 150 143 Latin                 America 1,079 756 615 Total $ 17,171 $ 16,191 $ 15,235 Our       tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which is mobile across       geographic markets. Accordingly, assets are not allocated to specific geographic       regions.
Note       15. Restructuring Restructuring       and Other Reserves The       following table shows our restructuring and other reserve balances as of       December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and the activity for the years then ended       related to (1) facility closures and other costs and (2) severance and related       costs under our 2005, 2004, 2002 and 2001 workforce reduction programs.       Substantially all of our restructuring and other reserves have been classified       as liabilities subject to compromise on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at       December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Restructuring                 and Other Charges Facilities Severance                 and Related Costs and Workforce                 Reduction Programs (in                 millions) Other 2005 2004 2002 2001 Balance                 at January 1, 2004 $ 47 $  $  $ 5 $ 1 Additional                 costs and expenses   42   Payments (8 )   (2 ) (1 ) Adjustments (1 )   (3 )  Balance                 at December 31, 2004 38  42   Additional                 costs and expenses 6 46 5   Payments (8 )  (36 )   Adjustments   (9 )   Balance                 at December 31, 2005 36 46 2   Additional                 costs and expenses 3 29    Payments (8 ) (53 ) (2 )   Adjustments (27 ) (21 )    Balance                 at December 31, 2006 $ 4 $ 1 $  $  $  The       facilities and other reserve balance includes costs related primarily to (1)       future lease payments on closed facilities, (2) contract termination fees and       (3) future lease payments associated with the early retirement of leased       aircraft. During 2006, we reduced the facilities and other reserve by $27       million primarily due to the rejection of certain facility leases and updated       estimates concerning future lease payments. During 2005, we recorded charges       of       $5 million for future lease payments associated with the early retirement of       leased aircraft, during the period from January 1, 2005 through the Petition       Date.
The       severance and related costs reserve represents future payments associated with       our 2005, 2004, 2002 and 2001 workforce reduction programs. During 2006,we       recorded an additional accrual of $29 million for costs associated with our       2005       program under which we planned to reduce staffing by 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by       December 2007. We also reduced the severance and related reserve associated       with       this program by $21 million due primarily to higher employee attrition than       previously assumed. At December 31, 2004, the $42 million balance related to       the       2004 workforce reduction programs represented severance and medical benefits       for       employees who qualified for the programs; this amount was paid during 2005       and       2006.
F-56 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Restructuring,       Asset Writedowns, Pension Settlements and Related Items,       Net 2006 In       2006,       we recorded a $13 million charge in restructuring, asset writedowns, pension       settlements and related items, net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations,       primarily due to the following:  Workforce                 Reduction.

This charge was partially offset by a $21                 million                 reduction in accruals associated with prior year workforce reduction                 programs.
2005 In       2005,       we recorded an $888 million charge in restructuring, asset writedowns, pension       settlements and related items, net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations,       as follows:  Pension                 Curtailment Charge.

F-57 NOTES             TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)  Asset                 Charges.
A                 $41 million aircraft impairment charge related to our agreement to                 sell                 eight owned MD-11 aircraft. In October 2004, we sold these aircraft                 and                 related inventory to a third party for $227                 million.
Note       16. Loss per Share We       calculate basic loss per share by dividing the net loss attributable to common       shareowners by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted       loss per share includes the dilutive effects of stock options and convertible       securities. To the extent stock options and convertible securities are       anti-dilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share.       The following table shows our computation of basic and diluted loss per       share: Years                 Ended December 31, (in                 millions, except per share data) 2006 2005 2004 Basic                 and diluted: Net                 loss $ (6,203 ) $ (3,818 ) $ (5,198 ) Dividends                 on allocated Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock (2 ) (18 ) (19 ) Net                 loss attributable to common shareowners (6,205 ) (3,836 ) (5,217 ) Weighted                 average shares outstanding 196.5 161.5 127.0 Basic                 and diluted loss per share $ (31.58 ) $ (23.75 ) $ (41.07 ) For       the       years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we excluded from our loss per       share calculations all common stock equivalents because their effect on loss       per       share was anti-dilutive. These common stock equivalents primarily include (1)       stock options and our ESOP Preferred Stock through the dates of their       cancellation and conversion, respectively, (see Notes 2 and 12 for additional       information) and (2) shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our       8.0%       Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and our 2 7 / 8 %       Convertible Senior Notes due 2024.
