Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, and Reports on Form 8-K 23 2 Table of Contents PART I Item 1Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of its non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., the Company changed its name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, the Company reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol COST.
General Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets.
Costco buys nearly all of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to Costcos selling warehouses or to a consolidation point (depot) where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs. As a result, Costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels, which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. By providing this more cost-effective means of distributing goods, Costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers, and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source. In addition, these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases. The cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for their personal needs. Costcos merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products, often in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities, at attractively low prices.
Because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, Costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors, even though Costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts. As sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital.
Costcos typical warehouse format averages approximately 137,000 square feet. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods, Costcos warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities.
By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and by offering membership to selected groups and businesses, Costco has been able to limit inventory losses to less than three-tenths of one percent of net saleswell below those of typical discount retail operations. Losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal, since individual memberships are generally limited to members of qualifying groups, and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit. Memberships are invalidated at the point of sale for those members who have issued dishonored checks to Costco.
3 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) Costcos policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and annual direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets. In connection with new warehouse openings, Costcos marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through credit unions, employee associations and other entities representing individuals who are eligible for Gold Star membership. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members.
Costcos warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 68-hour week, and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season. Generally, warehouses are open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Because these hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional discount grocery retailers and supermarkets, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. In addition, sales are processed through centralized, automated check-out stands. Most items are not individually price marked; rather, each item is bar-coded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers. This allows price changes without remarking merchandise. Substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise pre-marked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special, larger package sizes.
Costcos merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers, discount retailers or supermarkets. An important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which Costco can provide its members significant cost savings. Items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are usually not carried. Costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, the Company carries an average of only 3,700 to 4,500 active stockkeeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in its core warehouse business, as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40,000 to 60,000 SKUs or more. These practices are consistent with Costcos membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members, thereby encouraging high volume shopping. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities only. Appliances, equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models. Costcos policy is generally to accept returns of merchandise within a reasonable time after purchase.
The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by Costco during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, health and beauty aids, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and cleaning and institutional supplies) 31 % 31 % 30 % Food (including dry and fresh foods and institutionally packaged foods) 30 % 30 % 30 % Hardlines (including major appliances, video and audio tape, electronics, tools, office supplies, furniture and automotive supplies) 19 % 19 % 20 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, cameras, jewelry, housewares, books and small appliances) 11 % 11 % 12 % Other (including pharmacy, optical, one-hour photo, print shop, food court, hearing aid and gas stations) 9 % 9 % 8 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) Costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of merchandise is obtained by Costco from any one of these or any other single supplier. Costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable, it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business. Costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable, and the savings to its members are greater.
Costco reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of 13 four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first, second and third quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on Costcos operations, except an increased level of sales and earnings during the Christmas holiday season. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal year 2000 consisted of 53 weeks.
Membership Policy Costcos membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Costco has two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual) members. In addition, the Company offers an Executive Membership program to both Business and Gold Star members.
Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Costco promotes Business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45 for the primary and spouse membership card with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $35 (including a free spouse card).
Individual memberships are available to employees of federal, state and local governments, financial institutions, corporations, utility and transportation companies, public and private educational institutions, and other organizations. Individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45, which includes a spouse card.
Executive Memberships are available to all members for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit card processing, small business loans, auto and home insurance, long-distance telephone service, check printing, and real estate and mortgage services. The services offered are generally provided by third-party providers and vary by state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco.
As of September 1, 2002, Costco had approximately 4.5 million Business memberships and approximately 14.6 million Gold Star memberships. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location.
Labor As of September 1, 2002, Costco had approximately 92,000 employees, with about one-half of those being employed part-time. Approximately 12,700 hourly employees in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and one warehouse in Virginia are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. Costco considers its employee relations to be good.
5 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) Competition The Company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry. When The Price Company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in 1976, the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores, grocery stores and traditional wholesalers. Since then, new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment. Wal-Mart has become the largest retailer in the United States (and the world) and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats. Target has also emerged as a significant retail competitor. Approximately 980 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including the 350 warehouses operated by the Company in North America; and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. Low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Toys-R-Us, Circuit City and Barnes & Noble, have significant market share in their respective categories. New forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores, while home shopping and electronic commerce over the Internet is becoming increasingly popular. Likewise, in the institutional food business, companies such as Smart & Final, which operates predominately in California, Washington, Oregon, Florida and Arizona, are capturing an increasingly greater share of the institutional food business from wholesale operators and others.
Regulation Certain state laws require that the Company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. While compliance with such laws may cause the Company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and the Company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations.
It is the policy of the Company to sell at lower than manufacturers suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the Company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, the Company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict the Companys ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices. The Company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation.
Certain states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including the Company, within their jurisdictions. The Company believes that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations.
6 Table of Contents Item 2Properties Warehouse Properties At September 1, 2002, Costco operated 374 warehouse clubs: 290 in the United States (in 36 states and Puerto Rico); 60 in Canada (in 9 Canadian provinces); 14 in the United Kingdom (12 in England; 2 in Scotland); five in Korea; three in Taiwan; and two in Japan.

These warehouses are not included in the number of warehouses open in any period because the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method and therefore their operations are not consolidated in the Companys financial statements.
The Companys headquarters are located in Issaquah, Washington. Additionally, the Company maintains regional buying and administrative offices, operates regional cross-docking facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of certain shipments to the warehouses, and operates various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other businesses.
Item 3Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company does not believe that any such claim, proceeding, or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of its operations.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, conditions affecting the acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate, actions of vendors, and other risks identified from time to time in the Companys public statements and reports filed with the SEC.
Comparison of Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2001 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net income for fiscal 2002 increased 16% to $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share, from $602,089, or $1.29 per diluted share during fiscal year 2001.
Net sales increased 11% to $37,993,093 in fiscal 2002 from $34,137,021 in fiscal 2001. This increase was due to higher sales at existing locations opened prior to fiscal 2001; increased sales at the 32 new warehouses opened (39 opened, 7 closed) during fiscal 2001; and first year sales at the 29 new warehouses opened (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002. Changes in prices did not materially impact sales levels.
Comparable sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, increased at a 6% annual rate in fiscal 2002 compared to a 4% annual rate during fiscal 2001.
Membership fees and other revenue increased 17% to $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $660,016, or 1.93% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to the increase in membership fees across all member categoriesbeginning with renewals on October 1, 2000, averaging approximately fivedollars per member; additional membership sign-ups at the 29 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2002; and increased penetration of the Companys Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year, currently at 86%.
Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 13% to $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002 from $3,538,881, or 10.37% of net sales, in fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Companys core merchandising business, with fresh foods and foods and sundries categories being the primary contributors. Additionally, a reduction in the LIFO reserve, improved purchasing resulting from expanded depot operations and improved international operations had a positive effect on margins, while increased costs related to the Executive Membership Two-Percent Reward Program had a negative impact. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2002 was to increase gross margin by $13,500, compared to a gross margin decrease of $5,500 in fiscal 2001. If all inventories had been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $150 at September 1, 2002 and $13,650 at September 2, 2001.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.41% during fiscal 2002 from 9.17% during fiscal 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to higher expense ratios at new warehouses, where such expense ratios to sales are typically higher than at more mature warehouses; and also due to increases in salary, healthcare and workers compensation costs.
Preopening expenses totaled $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2002 and $59,571, or 0.17% of net sales, during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, the Company opened 35 new warehouses (including relocations) compared to 39 new warehouses (including relocations) during fiscal 2001. Pre-opening expenses also include 13 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations.
The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $21,050 in fiscal 2002 compared to $18,000 in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $7,765 for the Canadian administrative reorganization (See Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources) and $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses which were offset by net gains on the sale of real property totaling $398. The fiscal 2001 provision included charges of $19,000 for the Canadian administrative reorganization, $15,231 for the impairment of long-lived assets and $2,412 for warehouse closing expense, which were offset by $18,643 of gains on the sale of real property. At September 1, 2002, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $11,845, of which $10,395 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $15,434 at September 2, 2001, of which $6,538 related to future lease obligations. The increase in future lease obligations is attributable to leased warehouses constituting a larger percentage of the closed locations. (See Part II, Item 8Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1).
Interest expense totaled $29,096 in fiscal 2002, and $32,024 in fiscal 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to the retirement in April 2001 of a $140,000 unsecured note payable to banks and to the interest rate reduction on the Companys $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, resulting from interest rate swap agreements entered into effective November 13, 2001, converting the interest rate from fixed to floating. This decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the Company had fewer construction projects in progress during the fiscal 2002 period, and the weighted average capitalized interest rate was lower than in fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense was also offset by the issuance of the $300,000 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes issued in March, 2002, and simultaneously swapped to floating, and increased interest expense related to the Zero Coupon subordinated notes as accrued interest is accreted into principal.
Interest income and other totaled $35,745 in fiscal 2002, compared to $43,238 in fiscal 2001. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest income due to lower interest rates and lower daily cash and short-term investment balances on hand throughout fiscal 2002, as compared to fiscal 2001. This was partially offset by increased year-over-year earnings in Costco Mexico, the Companys 50%-owned joint venture.
The effective income tax rate on earnings was 38.5% in fiscal 2002 and 40% in fiscal 2001. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year-over-year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory rates for foreign operations, the effect of which is expected, substantially, to continue to impact the effective tax rate on a prospective basis.
Comparison of Fiscal 2001 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2000 (53 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net income for fiscal 2001, a 52-week fiscal year, decreased 5% to $602,089, or $1.29 per diluted share, from $631,437, or $1.35 per diluted share during fiscal year 2000, a 53-week fiscal year.
Net sales increased 8% to $34,137,021 in fiscal 2001 from $31,620,723 in fiscal 2000. This increase was due to higher sales at existing locations opened prior to fiscal 2000; increased sales at 21 warehouses (25 opened, 4 closed) that were opened in fiscal 2000 and in operation for the entire 2001 fiscal year; and first year sales at the 32 new warehouses opened (39 opened, 7 closed) during fiscal 2001. Changes in prices did not materially impact sales levels.
Comparable sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, increased at a 4% annual rate in fiscal 2001 compared to an 11% annual rate during fiscal 2000.
14 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership fees and other revenue increased 21% to $660,016, or 1.93% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $543,573, or 1.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily due to the increase in membership fees across most membership categories, averaging approximately $5 per member, which became effective beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000. Additionally, membership sign-ups at the 32 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2001 were also a factor in this increase.
Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 7% to $3,538,881, or 10.37% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $3,298,553, or 10.43% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased by six basis points due to costs related to the Executive Membership two percent reward program, which was somewhat offset by gross margin improvement in the Companys core merchandising activities and ancillary operations. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. If all inventories had been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $13,650 at September 2, 2001, and $8,150 at September 3, 2000.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.17% during fiscal 2001 from 8.71% during fiscal 2000, due to a number of a factors, including an increase in the entry level wage rate of hourly employees beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000; continued expansion of the Companys co-branded credit card program; higher utility and energy costs; and higher expenses associated with an increase in new warehouse openings year-over-year (a net of 32 and 21 warehouses opened in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively) where expense ratios to sales are typically higher than in more mature warehouses.
Preopening expenses totaled $59,571, or 0.17% of net sales, during fiscal 2001 and $42,321, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001, the Company opened 39 new warehouses (including relocations) compared to 25 new warehouses (including relocations) during fiscal 2000. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations.
The provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $18,000 in fiscal 2001 compared to $7,000 in fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2001 provision includes charges of $19,000 for the Canadian administrative reorganization (See Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources), $15,231 for the impairment of long-lived assets and $2,412 for warehouse closing expense, which were offset by $18,643 of gains on the sale of real property. At September 2, 2001, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $15,434, of which $6,538 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,762 at September 3, 2000, of which $8,887 related to future lease obligations. (See Part II, Item 8Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote1).
Interest expense totaled $32,024 in fiscal 2001, and $39,281 in fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to construction projects and a decrease related to the retirement of an unsecured note payable to banks with a principal amount totaling $140,000 in April 2001.
Interest income and other totaled $43,238 in fiscal 2001 compared to $54,226 in fiscal 2000. The decrease was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on lower balances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000, which was partially offset by improved earnings from Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint venture) on a year-over-year basis.
The effective income tax rate on earnings was 40% in both fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000.
15 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands) Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion through investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.
While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend an aggregate of approximately $1,000,000 to $1,100,000 during fiscal 2003 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures will be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations, the use of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, short-term borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program, Senior Notes and other financing sources as required.
Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2003 are to open approximately 28 to 30 new warehouse clubs, including three to five relocations to larger and better-located warehouses. The Company expects to continue expansion of its international operations and plans to open two additional warehouses in the United Kingdom through its 80%-owned subsidiary, and two additional warehouses in Japan. Other international markets are being assessed.
Costco and its Mexico-based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. As of September 1, 2002, Costco Mexico operated 20 warehouses in Mexico and plans to open one or two new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2003.
Reorganization of Canadian Administrative Operations On January 17, 2001, the Company announced plans to reorganize and consolidate the administration of its operations in Canada. Total costs related to the reorganization were $26,765 pre-tax, of which $7,765 pre-tax ($4,775 after-tax, or $.01 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2002 and $19,000 pre-tax ($11,400 after-tax, or $.02 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2001 and reported as part of the provision for impaired assets and closing costs. These costs consisted primarily of employee severance, implementation and consolidation of support systems and employee relocation. The reorganization was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has in place a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $400,000 bank credit facility with a group of 10 banks, of which $200,000 expires on November 11, 2003 and $200,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At September 1, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.
In addition, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $128,000 commercial paper program supported by a $51,000 bank credit facility with a group of three Canadian banks, which expires in March, 2003. At September1, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. The Company is evaluating the business need to renew this commercial paper program and bank credit facility.
The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the $451,000 combined amounts of the respective supporting bank credit facilities.
16 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term 4 billion bank line of credit, equal to approximately $33,600, of which 1 billion ($8,400) expires in April 2003 and 3 billion ($25,200) expires in November 2003. At September 1, 2002, $18,480 was outstanding under the line of credit with an applicable interest rate of 1.375%.
The Companys 80%-owned UK subsidiary has a 60 million ($93,048) bank revolving credit facility and a 20 million ($31,016) bank overdraft facility, both expiring in February 2007. At September 1, 2002, $85,294 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 4.413% and no balance was outstanding under the bank overdraft facility.
Letters of Credit The Company has separate letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $373,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September 1, 2002 totaled approximately $142,000, including approximately $32,000 in standby letters of credit.
Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under long-term contractual obligations was as follows, as of September 1, 2002.

Financing Activities During April 2001, the Company retired its unsecured note payable to banks of $140,000 using cash provided from operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings under its commercial paper program.
In October 2000, the Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3.5 billion Yen, equal to $29,400, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due on October 23, 2007.
In July 2001, the Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3 billion Yen, equal to $25,200, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on July 9, 2008.
In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating.
17 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, an additional $100,000 in debt securities were registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf registration to $600,000. The $300,000 of 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes issued in March 2002, reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000.
Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 1, 2002 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. As of September 1, 2002, the Company had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $35,926, which is recorded in other assets. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt, and result in no net earnings impact.
Financial Position and Cash Flows Working capital totaled $180,806 at September 1, 2002, compared to a negative working capital position of $229,732 at September 2, 2001. The increase of $410,538 was primarily due to an increase in net inventory levels (inventories less accounts payable) of $232,087; increases in cash and cash equivalents of $202,933; an increase in receivables of $150,093; and a decrease in short-term borrowings of $90,778, offset by increases in other current liabilities of $116,897; accrued salaries and benefits of $106,454 and deferred membership income of $37,932.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,018,243 in fiscal 2002, compared to $1,032,563 in fiscal 2001. The decrease of $14,320 is primarily a result of the change in the increase in net inventories (inventories less accounts payable) of $256,258 and a decrease in the change in deferred income taxes of $28,618; offset by a decrease in the receivables, other current assets, accrued and other current liabilities of approximately $136,042; higher net income in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 of $97,894 and a larger add-back for depreciation and amortization of $40,484.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,033,815 in fiscal 2002, compared to $1,339,843 in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $306,028. This decrease is primarily a result of decreases in additions to property and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses of $408,944 and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $27,500, which was offset by the decrease in the net cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $77,153 and the net cash proceeds from the sale of short-term investments of $36,671.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $217,828 in fiscal 2002 compared to $394,345 in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $176,517. The decrease primarily resulted from an increase in the net repayments of short-term borrowings of $285,117 and a change in bank overdrafts of $251,797, offset by an overall increase in the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $218,049 and a decrease in repayments of long-term debt of $140,788.
18 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Stock Repurchase Program (dollars in thousands except per share data) On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company can repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non-issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. To date, no shares have been repurchased under this program.
Under a previous stock purchase program which expired in November, 2001, the Company repurchased 3.13 million shares of common stock at an average price of $31.96 per share, totaling approximately $99,946 (excluding commissions). The Companys repurchase of its common shares under this program was transacted entirely in fiscal 2000.
Membership Fee Increases Beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000, the Company increased annual membership fees for its Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business Add-on Members. These fee increases averaged approximately $5 per member across its member categories, and are recorded as income ratably using the deferred method of accounting.
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to merchandise inventory, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self-insurance reserves. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company records a provision each quarter for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. The Company includes in its calculation of the LIFO provision the net realizable value of those inventory pools where deflation exists. The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.
Impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value.
The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys 19 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates.
Insurance/Self Insurance Reserve The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
Stock Options The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. The Company grants stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the plans.
On August 13, 2002 the Company announced that it would adopt the fair value based method of recording stock options consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS No. 123) for all employee stock options granted subsequent to fiscal year end 2002. All future employee stock option grants will be expensed over the option vesting period based on the estimated fair value at the date the options are granted.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles, which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. On September 3, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 and accordingly will continue to test previously reported goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. The overall effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on the Companys financial statements was not material and the Company recorded no impairment charge. The reduction in amortization expense going forward, as a result of the adoption, is not material.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS No. 143 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No.143 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No.121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Among other things, this statement rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, which required all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 20 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) No.30, Reporting the Results of Operations  Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, will now be used to classify those gains and losses. The statement was effective upon issuance in April 2002 for prospective transactions. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations in fiscal 2002.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
The nature and amount of the Companys long and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September 1, 2002, the Companys fixed rate long-term debt includes its $851,860 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $75,413. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and $300,000 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes. The Company has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt.
The Company holds interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. As these investments are of a short-term nature and are held until maturity, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. In addition, changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest income.
Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 1, 2002 were not material to the Companys results of operations or its financial position.

/s/R ICHARD A. G ALANTI Richard A. Galanti Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Date:November 22, 2002 27 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 1, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the 52 weeks then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 2, 2001 and for the 52 weeks ended September 2, 2001 and the 53 weeks ended September 3, 2000 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements in their report dated October 8, 2001.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 1, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the 52 weeks then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

33 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company). All material inter-company transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Costco primarily operates membership warehouses under the Costco Wholesale name.
Costco operates membership warehouses that offer low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities. At September 1, 2002, Costco operated 394 warehouse clubs: 290 in the United States; 60 in Canada; 14 in the United Kingdom; five in Korea; three in Taiwan; two in Japan; and 20 warehouses in Mexico with a joint venture partner.
The Companys investment in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. The investment in Costco Mexico is included in other assets and was $157,312 at September 1, 2002 and $147,905 at September 2, 2001. The equity in earnings of Costco Mexico is included in interest income and other and for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $21,028, $17,378 and $10,592, respectively. The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of Costco Mexico was $64,674 and $43,646 at September 1, 2002 and September 2, 2001, respectively.
Fiscal Years The Company reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis, which ends on the Sunday nearest August 31st. Fiscal year 2002 was 52 weeks, fiscal year 2001 was 52 weeks and fiscal year 2000 was 53 weeks.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of less than five days to be cash equivalents. Of the total cash and cash equivalents of $805,518 at September 1, 2002 and $602,585 at September 2, 2001, credit and debit card receivables were $351,788 and $241,413, respectively.
Short-term Investments Short-term investments consisted of corporate notes and bonds totaling $4,999 at September 2, 2001. These investments at the end of fiscal 2001 were designated as being available-for-sale and, accordingly, were reported at fair value. The fair market value of short-term investments approximates their carrying value and there were no unrealized holding gains or losses at September 1, 2002, and no significant unrealized holding gains and losses at September 2, 2001. Realized gains and losses are included in interest income and were not significant in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000. Short-term investments held by the Company at September 2, 2001, matured between one and sixty days from the purchase date.
Receivables, net Receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates and promotional allowances, receivables from government tax authorities and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company, and are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,224 at September 1, 2002 and $3,474 at September 2, 2001. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on known troubled accounts and historical experience applied to an aging of accounts.
34 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Vendor Rebates and Allowances Periodic payments from vendors in the form of buy downs, volume or other purchase discounts that are evidenced by signed agreements are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned and as a component of cost of sales as the merchandise is sold. Up-front consideration received from vendors linked to purchases or other commitments is initially deferred and amortized ratably over the life of the contract or as performance of the activities specified by the vendor to earn the fee is completed.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The LIFO inventory adjustment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 increased gross margin by approximately $21,000 as compared to $2,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. If all merchandise inventories had been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $150 at September 1, 2002 and $13,650 at September 2, 2001.
September 1, 2002 September 2, 2001 Merchandise inventories consist of: United States (primarily LIFO) $ 2,552,820 $ 2,244,986 Foreign (FIFO) 574,401 493,518 Total $ 3,127,221 $ 2,738,504 The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a standard percentage of sales. This provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual shrinkage results of the physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the Companys fiscal year.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes. Buildings are depreciated over twenty-five to thirty-five years; equipment and fixtures are depreciated over three to ten years; and leasehold improvements are amortized over the initial term of the lease.
Interest costs incurred on property and equipment during the construction period are capitalized. The amount of interest costs capitalized was $13,480 in fiscal 2002, $19,157 in fiscal 2001, and $10,919 in fiscal 2000.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, which may indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates the carrying value of the asset by comparing the estimated future cash flows generated 35 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition with the assets reported net book value. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, the Company recorded no pretax, non-cash charges in fiscal 2002, and $15,231 and $10,956 in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively, reflecting its estimate of impairment relating principally to excess property and closed warehouses. The charge reflects the difference between carrying value and fair value, which was based on estimated market valuations for those assets whose carrying value is not currently anticipated to be recoverable through future cash flows.
Goodwill Goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, resulting from certain business combinations is included in other assets, and totaled $43,920 at September 1, 2002 and $43,831 at September 2, 2001. On September 3, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles, which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. Accordingly, the Company reviews previously reported goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. In fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from two to forty years and was periodically evaluated for impairment as circumstances dictated. The effects on net income and net income per share data would not be significant if the Company had followed the provisions of SFAS No. 142 in the years ended September 2, 2001 and September 3, 2000.
Acquisition of Minority Interest On May 26, 2000, the Company acquired from the Littlewoods Organisation PLC its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited, bringing the Companys ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 80%. The acquisition was funded with cash and cash equivalents on hand. Costco Wholesale UK Limited currently operates fourteen Costco warehouse locations.
Accounts Payable The Companys banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Accordingly, included in accounts payable at September 1, 2002 and September 2, 2001 are $235,458 and $270,757 respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were drawn.
Insurance/Self Insurance Reserve The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated 36 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. As of September 1, 2002, the Company had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $35,926, which is recorded in other assets. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and the Companys $300,000 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value recorded on the hedged debt, and result in no net earnings impact.
Foreign Currency Translations The functional currencies of the Companys international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies, as well as the Companys investment in the Costco Mexico joint venture, are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss). Revenue and expenses of the Companys consolidated foreign operations are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in expenses.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of the Companys members. The Company accounts for membership fee income on a deferred basis whereby membership fee income is recognized ratably over the one-year life of the membership.
Marketing and Promotional Expenses Costcos policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and annual direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. Marketing and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.
Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, major remodels/expansions, regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and receivables approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. Debt carrying fixed interest rates does not approximate fair value. The fair value of fixed rate debt at September 1, 2002 and September 2, 2001 was $1,382,569 and $1,159,486, respectively.
37 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Reorganization of Canadian Administrative Operations On January 17, 2001, the Company announced plans to reorganize and consolidate the administration of its operations in Canada. Total costs related to the reorganization were $26,765 pre-tax, of which $7,765 pre-tax ($4,775 after-tax, or $.01 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2002 and $19,000 pre-tax ($11,400 after-tax, or $.02 per diluted share) was expensed in fiscal 2001 and reported as part of the provision for impaired assets and closing costs. These costs consisted primarily of employee severance, implementation and consolidation of support systems and employee relocation. The reorganization was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.
Closing Costs Warehouse closing costs incurred relate principally to the Companys efforts to relocate certain warehouses that were not otherwise impaired to larger and better-located facilities. As of September 1, 2002, the Companys reserve for warehouse closing costs was $11,845, of which $10,395 related to lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $15,434 at September 2, 2001, of which $6,538 related to lease obligations.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. That standard requires companies to account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Under the asset and liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.

These options are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of their exercise prices being greater than the average market price of the common shares during those fiscal years.
On November 30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company can repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non-issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. To date, no shares have been repurchased under this program.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFASNo. 143 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No.121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
39 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Among other things, this statement rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt which required all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, will now be used to classify those gains and losses. The statement was effective upon issuance in April 2002 for prospective transactions. The adoption of this statement had no material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for the Companys 2003 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Note 2Debt Bank Lines of Credit and Commercial Paper Programs The Company has in place a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $400,000 bank credit facility with a group of 10 banks, of which $200,000 expires on November 11, 2003 and $200,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At September 1, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the loan facility. Covenants related to the credit facility place limitations on total company indebtedness. As of September 1, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants.
In addition, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $128,000 commercial paper program supported by a $51,000 bank credit facility with three Canadian banks, which expires in March, 2003.

Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15. The indentures contain certain limitations on the Companys and certain subsidiaries ability to create liens securing indebtedness and to enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions. In November 2001, the Company entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements that replaced the fixed interest rate with a floating rate indexed to LIBOR.
In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes due March 15, 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. Simultaneous with the issuance of the 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest to a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. As of September 1, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants.
In October 2000, the Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3.5 billion Yen, equal to $29,400, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due on October 23, 2007.
In July 2001, the Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3 billion Yen, equal to $25,200, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on July 9, 2008.

On August 19, 1997, the Company completed the sale of $900,000 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes (the Notes) due August 19, 2017. The Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3 1 / 2 %, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $449,640. The Notes are convertible into a maximum of 19,344,969 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.00. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase the Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of 42 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 2Debt (Continued) purchase) on August 19, 2007, or 2012. The Company, at its option, may redeem the Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time on or after August 19, 2002. As of September 1, 2002, $48,140 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock.
In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, an additional $100,000 in debt securities were registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf registration to $600,000. The $300,000 of 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes issued in March 2002, reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000.
At September 1, 2002, the fair value of the 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, and the 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes, based on market quotes, was approximately $329,160 and $315,990, respectively. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The fair value of the 3 1 / 2 % Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes at September 1, 2002, based on market quotes, was approximately $662,006. The fair value of other long-term debt approximates carrying value.
Maturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows: 2003 $ 7,584 2004 3,239 2005 309,125 2006 1,302 2007 329,485 Thereafter 567,487 Total $ 1,218,222 Note 3Leases The Company leases land and/or warehouse buildings at 80 of the 374 warehouses open at September 1, 2002, and certain other office and distribution facilities under operating leases with remaining terms ranging from 1 to 40 years. These leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate; (b) purchase of the property at the then fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of a third party purchase offer. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on the price indices and some of the leases provide for rents based on the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Contingent rents have not been material.
Additionally, the Company leases certain equipment and fixtures under short-term operating leases that permit the Company to either renew for a series of one-year terms or to purchase the equipment at the then fair market value.

Future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter under non-cancelable leases with terms in excess of one year, at September 1, 2002, were as follows: 2003 $ 67,955 2004 64,469 2005 64,806 2006 65,540 2007 61,662 Thereafter 771,348 Total minimum payments $ 1,095,780 Note 4Stock Options The Companys 1993 Combined Stock Grant and Stock Option Plan (the 1993 Plan) provided for the issuance of up to 60 million shares of its common stock upon the exercise of stock options and up to 3,333,332 shares through stock grants. During fiscal 2002 the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2002 Plan) was adopted following shareholder approval. The 2002 plan authorized 30 million shares of common stock for issuance, subject to adjustment. For future grants, the 2002 plan replaces the 1993 plan and the 1993 plan has been amended to provide that no more options or stock grants may be issued under such plan. Any shares under the 1993 plan that remain available for future option grants (and any additional shares that subsequently become available through cancellation of unexercised options outstanding) will be added to the number of shares available for grant under the 2002 plan. The 2002 plan authorizes the Company to grant stock options to eligible employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under these plans have a ten-year term and a vesting period of 5 years. At September 1, 2002, options for approximately 19.8 million shares were vested and 26.6 million shares were available for future grants under the plan.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. The Company grants stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the plans.
On August 13, 2002 the Company announced that it would adopt the fair value based method of recording stock options consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS No. 123) for all employee stock options granted subsequent to fiscal year end 2002. All future employee stock option grants will be expensed over the option vesting period based on the estimated fair value at the date the options are granted.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 Risk free interest rate 4.45% 4.96% 6.56% Expected life 5years 5years 5years Expected volatility 46% 43% 42% Expected dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Stock option transactions relating to the aggregate of the Old and New Stock Option Plans are summarized below (shares in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Shares Price(1) Shares Price(1) Shares Price(1) Under option at beginning of year 39,578 $ 29.15 36,021 $ 26.09 36,778 $ 19.89 Granted(2) 7,641 38.10 8,822 34.18 7,501 42.76 Exercised (3,571 ) 18.77 (4,457 ) 14.04 (7,688 ) 12.74 Cancelled (687 ) 37.12 (808 ) 31.35 (570 ) 25.47 Under option at end of year 42,961 $ 31.49 39,578 $ 29.15 36,021 $ 26.09 (1) Weighted-average exercise price/grant price (2) The weighted-average fair value based on the Black-Scholes model of options granted during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, were $17.83, $15.47 and $20.35, respectively.

Note 5Retirement Plans The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan that is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90days of employment, except California union employees. The plan allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first one thousand dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each eligible participant a contribution based on salary and years of service. The Company has a defined contribution plan for Canadian and United Kingdom employees and contributes a percentage of each employees salary.
California union employees participate in a defined benefit plan sponsored by their union. The Company makes contributions based upon its union agreement. The Company also sponsors a 401(k) plan for the California union employees. The plan currently allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first four hundred dollars of employee contributions.
Amounts expensed under these plans were $127,189, $108,256, and $97,830 for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company has defined contribution 401(k) and retirement plans only, and thus has no liability for post-retirement benefit obligations under the SFAS No. 106 Employers Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other than Pensions.
