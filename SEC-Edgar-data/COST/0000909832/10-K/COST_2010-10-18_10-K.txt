Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules 33 2 Table of Contents PART I Item1Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of its non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., the Company changed its name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August30, 1999, the Company reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol COST.
General Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets.
Costco buys the majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to Costcos selling warehouses or to a consolidation point (depot) where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs. As a result, Costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels, which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. By providing this more cost-effective means of distributing goods, Costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers, and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source. In addition, these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases. The cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for their personal needs. Costcos merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label products, often in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities, at attractively low prices.
Because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, Costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors, even though Costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts. As sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital.
Costcos typical warehouse format averages approximately 139,000 square feet. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods, Costcos warehouses need not be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities.
By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and using a membership format, Costco has been able to limit inventory losses to less than two-tenths of one percent of net saleswell below those of typical discount retail operations. Losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit. Members are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale when they have presented dishonored checks to Costco.
3 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) Costcos policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets. In connection with new warehouse openings, Costcos marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members.
Costcos warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season. Generally, warehouses are open weekdays between 10:00a.m. and 8:30p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional wholesalers, discount grocery retailers and supermarkets and due to other operational efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. In addition, sales are processed through centralized, automated check-out stands. Most items are not individually price-marked; rather, each item is bar-coded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers. This allows price changes without remarking merchandise. Substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise pre-marked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special, larger package sizes.
Costcos merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional wholesalers, discount retailers or supermarkets. An important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which Costco can provide its members significant cost savings. Items that members may request but that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are often not carried. Costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, the Company carries an average of approximately 4,000 active stockkeeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in its core warehouse business, as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40,000 to 60,000 SKUs or more. These practices are consistent with Costcos membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members, thereby encouraging high volume shopping. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities only. Appliances, equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models. In keeping with its policy of customer satisfaction, Costcos policy is to accept returns of merchandise.
The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by Costco during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Food (including dry and fresh foods and institutionally packaged foods) 31 % 31 % 30 % Sundries (including candy, snack foods, health and beauty aids, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and cleaning and institutional supplies) 29 % 29 % 30 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, hardware, office supplies, garden and patio, sporting goods, furniture, cameras and automotive supplies) 16 % 16 % 16 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings and small appliances) 12 % 13 % 14 % Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and print shop) 12 % 11 % 10 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) Costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of merchandise is obtained by Costco from any one of these or any other single supplier. Costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became unavailable, it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business. Costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the savings to its members are greater.
Financial information of the Companys segments and geographic areas is included in Note 9, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Costco reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first, second and third quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on Costcos operations, except an increased level of sales and earnings during the Christmas holiday season. Fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 all consisted of 52 weeks.
Membership Policy Costcos membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Costco has two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual) members. In addition, the Company offers an Executive Membership program to both Business and Gold Star members.
Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Costco promotes Business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45 for the primary and spouse membership card with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $35 (including a free spouse card).
Individual memberships (Gold Star memberships) are available to employees of federal, state and local governments, financial institutions, corporations, utility and transportation companies, public and private educational institutions, other organizations and to other persons. Individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45, which includes a spouse card.
Executive memberships are available to all members for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit card processing, small business loans, auto and home insurance, long-distance telephone service, check printing, and real estate and mortgage services. The services offered are generally provided by third-party providers and vary by state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco.
As of August28, 2005, Costco had approximately 5.0million primary Business memberships and approximately 16.2million Gold Star memberships. Included within this membership base are approximately 4.2million members that have upgraded to the Executive Membership program. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location.
Labor As of August28, 2005, Costco had approximately 118,000 employees, including approximately 8,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which is not consolidated. Approximately forty-five percent of the employee base is part-time. Approximately 13,500 hourly employees in 5 Table of Contents Item1Business (Continued) certain of the Companys locations in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and one warehouse in Virginia are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. Costco considers its employee relations to be good.
Competition The Company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry. When The Price Company pioneered the membership warehouse club concept in 1976, the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores, grocery stores and traditional wholesalers. Since then, new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment. Wal-Mart has become the largest retailer in the United States (and the world) and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats. Target and Kohls have also emerged as significant retail competitors. Over 1,100 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including the 403 warehouses operated by the Company in North America; and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. Low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowes, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Best Buy and Barnes& Noble, have significant market share in their categories. New forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores, while home shopping and electronic commerce over the Internet is becoming increasingly popular.
Regulation Certain state laws require that the Company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. While compliance with such laws may cause the Company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and the Company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations.
It is the policy of the Company to sell at lower than manufacturers suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the Company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, the Company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict the Companys ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices. The Company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation.
Certain states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including the Company, within their jurisdictions. The Company believes that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations.

At August28, 2005, the Company operated 27 warehouses in Mexico (through a 50%-owned joint venture). These warehouses are not included in the number of warehouses open in any period because the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method and, therefore, its operations are not consolidated in the Companys financial statements.
Costcos executive offices are located in Issaquah, Washington and occupy approximately 361,000 square feet. In addition, the Company operated eight regional offices in the United States, two regional offices in Canada and four regional offices internationally at the end of fiscal 2005, containing approximately 309,000 square feet. Additionally, the Company operates regional cross-docking facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of certain shipments to the warehouses, and operates various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other businesses. At the end of fiscal 2005, Costco operated nine depots in the United States, three in Canada and two internationally, excluding Mexico, consisting of approximately 5.3million square feet.
7 Table of Contents Item3Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company is a defendant in two actions purportedly brought as class actions on behalf of certain present and former Costco managers in California, in which plaintiffs allege that they have not been properly compensated for overtime work. Scott M. Williams v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, United States District Court (San Diego), Case No.02-CV-2003 NAJ (JFS); Superior Court for the County of San Diego, Case No. GIC-792559; Greg Randall v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC-296369. The Company is also a defendant in an overtime compensation case purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs allege that Costcos semi-annual bonus formula is improper with regard to retroactive overtime pay. Anthony Marin v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, Superior Court for the County of Alameda, Case No. RG-04150447. The Company is also a defendant in an action purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs allege that Costco did not properly compensate and record hours worked by employees and failed to provide meal and rest breaks. Kevin Doty and Sarah Doty v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, United States District Court ( Los Angeles), Case No. CV-05-3241 FMC (JWJx). Claims in these four actions are made under various provisions of the California Labor Code and the California Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek restitution/disgorgement, compensatory damages, various statutory penalties, liquidated damages, punitive, treble and exemplary damages, and attorneys fees. The Company also is a defendant in an action purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Shirley Rae Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, United States District Court (San Francisco), Case No. C-04-3341-MHP. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, exemplary and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. In none of these five cases has the Court been asked yet to determine whether the action should proceed as a class action or, if so, the definition of the class. The Company expects to vigorously defend these actions and does not believe that any claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of its operations.

Executive Overview and Selected Consolidated Statements of Income Data (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Overview Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets.
Key items for fiscal year 2005 included:  Net sales increased 10% over the prior year, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 7% and the opening of 16 new warehouses;  Membership fees for fiscal 2005 increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, representing new member sign-ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increasing penetration of the Companys Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates;  Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) decreased nine basis points as a percent of net sales over the prior year. Gross margins increased year-over-year in most of the Companys merchandise categories, but were offset by changes in the sales mix with higher penetration of lower margin departments, primarily gas. Additionally, margins were negatively impacted by ten basis points due to increased sales penetration of the Executive Membership Program and its related costs;  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved two basis points over the prior year, largely due to increased payroll leverage due to increased sales, a decrease in health care costs as a percent of net sales and a flattening of the rising trend in workers compensation costs, offset by higher stock option expense;  Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by several non-recurring items that are discussed further in the comparison of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 below. Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year.
The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.10 to $0.115 per share; and  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company repurchased shares of Costco common stock, expending approximately $413,252 repurchasing 9.2million shares of stock at an average cost of $44.89 per share.

Comparison of Fiscal 2005 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2005 increased 20.5% to $1,063,092, or $2.18 per diluted share, from $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, during fiscal year 2004. Net income during fiscal 2005 was impacted by the following: a $54,155 (approximately $.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996-2003); a cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge to preopening expenses of $15,999 (approximately $.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to the Companys method of accounting for ground leases (entered into over the past twenty years) that did not require rental payments during the period of construction; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20,592 (approximately $.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $998,326 or $2.04 per diluted share, a 10% increase in earnings per share over the prior fiscal year.
Net Sales Net sales increased 10.0% to $51,862,072 in fiscal 2005 from $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004. Approximately 71% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2005 and 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.03-10, Application of Issue No.02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a 14 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03-10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the net sales increase in fiscal 2005 would have been 10.4%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03-10.) For fiscal 2005, comparable sales increased 7% from fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2004, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2005 would have been 8%.
Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for approximately 89 basis points of the sales increase. In addition, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales due to stronger foreign currencies, accounting for approximately 134 basis points year-over-year of the comparable sales increase.
Membership Fees Membership fees increased 11.6% to $1,073,156, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign-ups at the 16 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2005, increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently 86%.
Gross Margin Gross margin increased 9.1% to $5,515,111, or 10.63% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The nine basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments. The three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix, with higher penetration of lower margin departments. This effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of the Companys merchandise departments, as well as the international operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of EITF 03-10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally. The gross margin percentage was reduced by 10 basis points due to the increased penetration of the Executive Member program, increased spending by Executive Members and the resulting increases in the related costs.
The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2005 included a $13,410 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge. The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year-over-year basis negatively impacted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, by one additional basis point.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.7% to $5,044,341, or 9.73% of net sales, in fiscal 2005, from $4,597,877, or 9.75% of net sales, in fiscal 2004. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for all of fiscal 2004, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of four basis points in fiscal 2005.
For fiscal 2005, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year-over-year by approximately 13 basis points, primarily due to improved payroll utilization at the warehouse level, including increased leverage from increased comparable sales and cost control measures employed in employee 15 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) benefits, primarily health care. This improvement was partially offset by the implementation of EITF 03-10, which negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of net sales by five basis points and an increase in stock-based compensation costs approximating six basis points year-over-year.
Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $53,230, or 0.10% of net sales, during fiscal 2005 compared to $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions February7, 2005 letter related to leases, the Company adjusted its method of accounting for leases (entered into over the past twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge of $15,999 to preopening expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to effect this accounting adjustment. Prior periods financial results have not been restated due to the immateriality of this amount to the consolidated financial statements. Twenty-one warehouses (including five relocations) were opened in fiscal 2005 compared to the opening of 20 warehouses in fiscal 2004. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses.
Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $16,393 in fiscal 2005, compared to $1,000 in fiscal 2004. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long-lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $3,893 for impairment of long-lived assets, $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property.
At August28, 2005, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations.
Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $34,437 in fiscal 2005, compared to $36,651 in fiscal 2004. Interest expense in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 includes interest on the 3 1 / 2 % Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1 / 8 % and 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest on the Companys 3 1 / 2 % Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted approximately $280,811 in principle amount of the Notes into common stock during fiscal 2005. Additionally, capitalized interest increased year-over-year as interest rates and construction costs increased in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increases in interest on the Senior Notes as these fixed rate instruments were swapped into variable rate debt in November 2001 and March 2002, which was mitigated by the fact that the 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June15, 2005.
Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $109,096 in fiscal 2005, compared to $51,627 in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short-term investments on hand throughout fiscal 2005, as well as higher interest rates earned on the balances as compared to fiscal 2004.
16 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is attributable to a one-time $54,155 income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996-2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to the net tax benefit of $20,592, noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%.
Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks): (dollars in thousands, except earnings per share) Net Income Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003.
Net Sales Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.03-10, Application of Issue No.02-16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, which was effective at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03-10, which primarily impacts the Companys vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Companys consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03-10.) For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%.
Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year-over-year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Companys 2004 fiscal year. The positive impact to sales for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points.
17 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Membership Fees Membership fees increased 12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign-ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of the Companys Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%.
Gross Margin Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Companys merchandise departments, helped by strong year-over-year gross margin gains in the Companys ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year-over-year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03-10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced, resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year-over-year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two-Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the penetration of the Executive Member program.
The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the LIFO method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year-over-year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004.
For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year-over-year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03-10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Companys third-party insurance providers, and an increase in stock-based compensation costs following the Companys prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, at the beginning of fiscal 2003, of four basis points.
Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses.
18 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal 2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long-lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long-lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations.
Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on the 3 1 / 2 % Zero Coupon Notes, 7 1 / 8 % and 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Companys bank credit facilities and promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Companys reduction in short-term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating.
Interest Income and Other Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short-term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%.
Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one-time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies.
Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Cash Flows The Companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances, which were $3,459,857 and $3,129,882 at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,783,177 in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $315,606. Higher net income and a decrease in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) year-over-year increased cash flow from operating activities by $391,571. This increase was offset by decreases in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $706,855, primarily relating to the timing in the collection of certain receivables and in payments of income taxes in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004.
A significant component of net cash used in investing activities continues to be the purchase of property and equipment related to the Companys warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,058,729 in fiscal 2005 compared to $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1,010,248. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to an increase in the net investment in short-term investments of $768,596 and an increase in additions to property and equipment of $289,811 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004.
19 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Net cash used in financing activities totaled $518,651 in fiscal 2005 compared to $209,569 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. The decrease of $728,220 primarily resulted from an increase in the repayment of debt of $297,275 primarily relating to the repayment of the 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, which matured on June15, 2005, and repurchases of common stock of $413,252 under the Companys $500,000 share repurchase program.
Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November26, 2004 and February25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November5, 2004 and February8, 2005, respectively. The third and fourth dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May27, 2005 and August26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May6, 2005 and August5, 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2004 the Company paid dividends of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters.
Contractual Obligations The Companys commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August28, 2005.
Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long-term debt (1)(2) $ 879,520 $ 18,064 $ 379,466 $ 65,437 $ 416,553 Capital lease obligations 6,591 3,225 1,305 927 1,134 Operating leases (3) 1,562,267 114,682 219,402 189,188 1,038,995 Purchase obligations (merchandise) (4) 3,049,398 3,048,785 613   Purchase obligations (building, equipment, services and other) (5) 242,361 230,086 12,275   Other (6) 8,591 1,354 1,692 1,362 4,183 Total $ 5,748,728 $ 3,416,196 $ 614,753 $ 256,914 $ 1,460,865 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments.
(2) The amount includes interest accreted to maturity for the Companys Zero Coupon 3 1 / 2 % Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 2017, totaling $415,246. The consolidated balance sheet as of August28, 2005 reflects a balance outstanding of $274,071.
(3) Operating lease obligations have been reduced by $168,742 to reflect sub-lease income.
(4) Includes open merchandise purchase orders at fiscal year end.
(5) The amounts exclude minor outsourced services negotiated at the individual warehouse level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
(6) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations.
Expansion Plans Costcos primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for international expansion.
20 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1,100,000 to $1,250,000 during fiscal 2006 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2006 are to open approximately 28-30 new warehouse clubs on a net basis, inclusive of two to three relocations to larger and better-located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning to open three additional warehouses in the U.K during fiscal 2006. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2006.
Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures On June30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc for $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. On October3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars) The Company has a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $150,000 bank credit facility ($300,000 at August29, 2004) with a group of nine banks, which expires on November15, 2005, and is not expected to be renewed. At August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, were 3.92% and 1.90%, respectively.
A wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary has a $167,000 commercial paper program ($152,000 at August29, 2004) supported by a $50,000 bank credit facility ($46,000 at August29, 2004) with a Canadian bank, which is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2006. At August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, were 4.25% and 3.75%, respectively.

The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $177,000 at August28, 2005, decreasing to $27,000 on November15, 2005. At August29, 2004, the combined amount of supporting bank credit facilities was $325,000.
The Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term $13,694 bank line of credit that expires in February 2006. At August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, $5,477 and $0, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $3,652 and $2,576, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. A second 21 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $13,694 bank line of credit was entered into in February 2005 that expires in February 2006. At August28, 2005, $9,129 was borrowed under the second facility; this bank line was not in place at August29, 2004. Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at both August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, were .84%.
The Companys Korean subsidiary has a short-term $11,665 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2006. At August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $1,668 and $0, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, were 4.51% and 4.52%, respectively.
The Companys Taiwan subsidiary has a $7,439 bank revolving credit facility that expires in January 2006.

Applicable interest rates on the credit facilities at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, were 3.75% and 3.50%, respectively.
The Companys wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $108,408 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,238 bank overdraft facility renewable on a yearly basis in March 2006. At August28, 2005, $39,750 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.30% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility. At August29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility.
Letters of Credit The Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $401,933. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004 totaled approximately $131,169 and $166,800, respectively, including approximately $64,532 and $52,900, respectively, in standby letters of credit.
Financing Activities The Companys 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, carried at $304,350 at August29, 2004, matured and were repaid on June15, 2005 from its cash and cash equivalents.
In April 2003, the Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on April26, 2010.
In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes carried at $307,688 due March15, 2007. Interest is payable semi-annually. Simultaneous with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements converting the interest from fixed to floating.
In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October23, 2001, additional debt securities of $100,000 were registered. The $300,000 of 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000.
During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1 / 2 % Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes were converted by note holders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock.
22 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. As of August28, 2005, the Company had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August29, 2004, the Company had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes effective November13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of its operating leases, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Companys financial condition or consolidated financial statements.
Stock Repurchase Program On November30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market. Through August28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions.
Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, August29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000 of Costco common stock. Under the program, which contains no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant.
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory, 23 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self-insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels.
The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, Costco records the net amounts as commissions earned.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. At August28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation.
The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the Companys fiscal year.
Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approach.
Impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. Managements judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value.
24 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The Company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs, based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Companys actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates.
Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.20 and FASB Statement No.3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non-discretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No.47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No.143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123R, Share-based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black-Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique or option-pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black-Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value 25 Table of Contents Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006, which would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.151, Inventory Costs  An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No.43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets  An Amendment of APB No.29. The provisions of this statement are effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance  that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No.03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a three-step model for determining whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-1-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No.03-1 The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03-1-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10-18 of EITF 03-1 and references existing other-than-temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other-than-temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03-1-1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No.03-10, Application of Issue No.02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03-10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively.
26 Table of Contents Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
The nature and amount of the Companys long and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of August28, 2005, the Companys fixed rate long-term debt includes its $415,246 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes carried at $274,071 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $132,141. The Companys debt also includes $300,000 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes carried at $307,688. The Company has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. As of August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, the Company had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and an aggregate fair value of $7,688 and $25,754, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt.
The Company holds interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Companys investment policy is to manage its total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. The Company diversifies its investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment-grade securities and through internal management and the use of third-party investment managers. Short-term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short-term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances at August28, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15,000 to interest income (pre-tax) on an annual basis.
Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Companys exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August28, 2005 was $42,901.

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those policies and procedures that: (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the 52 weeks ended August28, 2005,August29, 2004, and August31, 2003, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Effective February16, 2004, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.03-10, Application of Issue No.02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting. Our report refers to the Companys change in method of accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor to conform to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force No.03-10, effective February16, 2004 and Issue No.02-16 effective during the year ended August31, 2003.
/s/KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington November9, 2005 36 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Costco Wholesale Corporation: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item8 , that Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission .
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August28, 2005 and August29 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the 52 weeks ended August28, 2005,August29, 2004 and August31, 2003 and our report dated November9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

41 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company). All material inter-company transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.
Costco operates membership warehouses that offer low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities. At August28, 2005, Costco operated 460 warehouse clubs: 335 in the United States and three in Puerto Rico; 65 in Canada; 16 in the United Kingdom; five in Korea; four in Taiwan; five in Japan; and 27 warehouses in Mexico (through a 50%-owned joint venture).
The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned, and for which the Company does not control, are accounted for under the equity method. The investment in Costco Mexico is included in other assets and was $232,402 at August28, 2005 and $178,997 at August29, 2004. The equity in earnings of Costco Mexico is included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, and for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $24,949, $22,208 and $21,400, respectively. The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of Costco Mexico was $133,231 and $108,282 at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, respectively.
Fiscal Years The Company reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis, which ends on the Sunday nearest August31st. Fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 52-week years.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of less than five days to be cash equivalents. Of the total cash and cash equivalents of $2,062,585 at August28, 2005 and $2,823,135 at August29, 2004, credit and debit card receivables were $521,634 and $441,244, respectively.
Short-term Investments Short-term investments have a maturity of three months to five years at the date of purchase. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available for sale are recorded at market value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. Certificates of deposit and $215,525 and $171,179 of corporate notes and bonds at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, respectively, have been designated as hold to maturity securities and are recorded at cost. At August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, the cost of these securities approximated market value.
42 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Short-term investments at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, were as follows: Fiscal 2005 Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Certificates of deposit $ 43,719 $  $  $ 43,719 U.S. government and agency securities 562,370 25 (4,629 ) 557,766 Money market mutual funds 49,372   49,372 Corporate notes and bonds 696,267 66 (2,289 ) 694,044 Asset and mortgage backed securities 52,782 21 (432 ) 52,371 Total short-term investments $ 1,404,510 $ 112 $ (7,350 ) $ 1,397,272 Fiscal 2004 Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Certificates of deposit $ 23,450 $  $  $ 23,450 U.S. government and agency securities 46,060 102 (107 ) 46,055 Money market mutual funds 1,662   1,662 Corporate notes and bonds 216,271 95 (149 ) 216,217 Asset and mortgage backed securities 19,444 34 (115 ) 19,363 Total short-term investments $ 306,887 $ 231 $ (371 ) $ 306,747 Unrealized losses from fixed income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Of the unrealized losses of $7,350 and $371 at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, respectively, $222 and $0 have holding periods exceeding twelve months. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of August28, 2005. The Company currently has the financial ability to hold short-term investments with an unrealized loss until maturity and not incur any recognized losses.
The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. The maturities of short-term investments at August28, 2005, were as follows: Cost Basis Estimated Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 736,390 $ 735,075 Due after one year through five years 648,079 642,249 Due after five years 20,041 19,948 Total $ 1,404,510 $ 1,397,272 Short-term investments include fixed maturity securities.
Receivables, net Receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates and promotional allowances, receivables from government tax authorities and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company, and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,416 at August28, 2005 and $1,139 at August29, 2004. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on known troubled accounts and historical experience applied to an aging of accounts.
43 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Vendor Rebates and Allowances Periodic payments from vendors in the form of volume rebates or other purchase discounts that are evidenced by signed agreements are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount and as a component of cost of sales as the merchandise is sold. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by other systematic and rational approach.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. At August28, 2005, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. At August29, 2004, merchandise inventories valued using LIFO exceeded the comparable FIFO value by approximately $13,410 due to the aggregate effects of deflation.
August28, 2005 August29, 2004 Merchandise inventories consist of: United States (primarily LIFO) $ 3,155,462 $ 2,903,551 Foreign (FIFO) 859,237 740,034 Total $ 4,014,699 $ 3,643,585 The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a standard percentage of sales. This provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual shrinkage results of the physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the Companys fiscal year.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Buildings are generally depreciated over twenty-five to thirty-five years; equipment and fixtures are depreciated over three to ten years; leasehold improvements are amortized over the initial term of the lease or the useful lives of the assets if shorter. The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes those costs using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years.
Interest costs incurred on property during the construction period are capitalized. The amount of interest costs capitalized was $7,226 in fiscal 2005, $4,155 in fiscal 2004, and $3,272 in fiscal 2003.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of long-lived assets for impairment when management makes the decision to relocate or close a warehouse or when events or changes in circumstances occur, which 44 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) may indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates the carrying value of the asset by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition with the assets reported net carrying value. The Company recorded pre-tax, non-cash charges of $3,893, $2,592 and $4,697 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflecting its estimate of impairment relating to real property. The charge reflects the difference between the carrying value and fair value, which was based on estimated market valuations for those assets whose carrying value is not currently anticipated to be recoverable through future cash flows.
Goodwill Goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, resulting from certain business combinations is included in other assets, and totaled $71,848 at August28, 2005 and $65,721 at August29, 2004. The increase in goodwill was primarily due to the Company acquiring the remaining 4% interest in CWC Travel Inc, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles, which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets should no longer be amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. Accordingly, the Company reviews previously reported goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. No impairment of goodwill has been incurred to date.
Accounts Payable The Companys banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Accordingly, included in accounts payable at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004 are $527,920 and $438,025, respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were drawn.
Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, was $42,466 and $30,495, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. The only other derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, 45 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Companys mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. As of August28, 2005, the Company had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300,000 and an aggregate fair value of $7,688, which is recorded in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective March25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the Companys $300,000 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact. As of August29, 2004, the Company had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754. In addition to the Companys swap on the 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes noted above, the Company had entered into a swap on its $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes effective November13, 2001, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge. The $300,000 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes matured and were repaid on June15, 2005. Concurrent to this transaction, the related swap agreement expired.
Equity Investments in Subsidiary and Joint Ventures On June30, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining 4% equity interest in CWC Travel Inc for cash of $3,961, bringing Costcos ownership in this entity to 100%. In conjunction with this purchase the Company recorded goodwill of $3,440. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership as the joint venture partner made a like investment. On October3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costcos ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. In conjunction with this purchase the Company increased the carrying value of the land and buildings of Costco Wholesale UK Limited by $12,808 and recorded goodwill of $16,719.
Foreign Currency Translations The functional currencies of the Companys international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies, as well as the Companys investment in the Costco Mexico joint venture, are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other accumulated comprehensive income (loss). Revenue and expenses of the Companys consolidated foreign operations are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in expenses and were not significant in fiscal 2005, 2004, or 2003.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The allowance for sales returns (sales returns net of merchandise costs) was $8,240 and $5,524 at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004, respectively.
46 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the Company is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts as commissions earned.
Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of the Companys members. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year term of the membership. The Companys Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. The Company accounts for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. The reduction in sales for the fiscal years ended August28, 2005,August29, 2004 and August31, 2003, and the related liability as of those dates were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended August28, 2005 August29, 2004 August31, 2003 Two-percent reward sales reduction $ 319,336 $ 244,487 $ 169,612 Two-percent unredeemed reward liability $ 229,574 $ 170,941 $ 114,681 Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound shipping charges and all costs related to our depot operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation on production equipment, and other related expenses incurred in certain fresh foods and ancillary departments.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers compensation costs for warehouse employees, other than fresh foods and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include utilities, bank charges and substantially all building and equipment depreciation, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.
Marketing and Promotional Expenses Costcos policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. Marketing and promotional costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Stock-Based Compensation The Company adopted the fair value based method of recording stock options consistent with SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for all employee stock options granted subsequent to fiscal year end 2002. Specifically, the Company adopted SFAS No.123 using the prospective method with guidance provided from SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure. All employee stock option grants made since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have or will be expensed over the related stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted. Prior to fiscal 2003, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. Because the Company granted stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant prior to fiscal 2003, no compensation cost was recognized for these option grants.
Had compensation costs for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards made prior to fiscal 2003, under those plans and consistent with SFAS No.123, the Companys net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: Fiscal Year Ended August28, 2005 August29, 2004 August31, 2003 Net income, as reported $ 1,063,092 $ 882,393 $ 721,000 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 43,344 23,000 7,513 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based methods for all awards, net of related tax effects (63,012 ) (58,388 ) (70,257 ) Pro-forma net income $ 1,043,424 $ 847,005 $ 658,256 Net Income per share: Basicas reported $ 2.24 $ 1.92 $ 1.58 Basicpro-forma $ 2.20 $ 1.84 $ 1.44 Dilutedas reported $ 2.18 $ 1.85 $ 1.53 Dilutedpro-forma $ 2.12 $ 1.78 $ 1.40 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. Short-term investments classified as available for sale are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses reflected 48 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Short-term investments designated as hold-to-maturity securities are recorded at cost and approximated market value at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004. The fair value of fixed rate debt at August28, 2005 and August29, 2004 was $841,399 and $1,581,368, respectively, including the senior debt that the Company entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements.
Closing Costs Warehouse closing costs incurred relate principally to the Companys efforts to relocate certain warehouses that were not otherwise impaired to larger and better-located facilities. The provision for fiscal 2005 included charges of $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses and net losses of $881 related to the sale of real property. The fiscal 2004 provision included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses offset by net gains of $15,548 related to the sale of real property. As of August28, 2005, the Companys reserve for warehouse closing costs was $9,556, of which $9,118 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $10,367 at August29, 2004, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations.
Interest Income and Other Interest income and other includes: Fiscal Year Ended August28, 2005 August29, 2004 August31, 2003 Interest income $ 81,915 $ 31,537 $ 21,200 Earnings of affiliates/minority interest and other 27,181 20,090 17,325 Total $ 109,096 $ 51,627 $ 38,525 Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. That standard requires companies to account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Under the asset and liability method of SFAS No.109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.
Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for income tax when, despite the belief that its tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that are not probable of being sustained. The consolidated tax provision and related 49 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest as deemed appropriate. To the extent that the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.
Net Income Per Common and Common Equivalent Share The following data show the amounts used in computing net income per share and the effect on income and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common stock.

These options are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect.
Dividends Costcos Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first two dividends of $0.10 per share were paid November26, 2004 and February25, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November5, 2004 and February8, 2005, respectively. The remaining two dividends of $0.115 per share were paid May27, 2005 and August26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May6, 2005 and August5, 2005, respectively. The Company paid a dividend of $0.10 per share in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004.
Payment of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Factors considered in determining the size of the dividends are profitability and expected capital needs of the Company. Subject to qualifications stated above, the Company presently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.
Stock Repurchase Program On November30, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November30, 2004. Under the program, 50 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would be retired. On October25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. On June7, 2005 the Company began repurchasing shares on the open market and through August28, 2005 the Company has repurchased 9,205,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $44.89, totaling approximately $413,252, including commissions.
Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end, on August29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Costco authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $1,000,000. Under the program, which has no expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. Subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2005 year end and through October28, 2005, the Company purchased an additional 2,247,000 shares at an average price of $45.83, fully utilizing the amount approved by the Board of Directors in October 2004 and reducing the amount of share value available to be purchased under the plan approved in fiscal 2006 by $16,240.
Significant Non-Cash Transactions During fiscal 2005, $280,811 in principal amount of the Companys 3 1 / 2 % Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes was converted by noteholders into 9,910,011 shares of common stock.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, A Replacement of APB Opinion No.20 and FASB Statement No.3. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non-discretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal 2007.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No.47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No.143, which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123R, Share-based Payments. SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which the Company adopted as of the beginning of its fiscal 2003, and supersedes APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R applies to 51 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. All employee stock option grants made by the Company since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been expensed over the related option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted using the Black-Scholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique, or option-pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black-Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of its fiscal 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of FAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing $13,043 in fiscal 2006 that would previously have been presented in a proforma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.151, Inventory CostsAn Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No.43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. Further, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.153, Exchanges of Non-monetary AssetsAn Amendment of APB No.29. The provisions of this statement are effective for asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance  that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In March 2004, the FASB EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No.03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a three-step model for determining whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after June15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after June15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-1-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No.03-1 The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, (FSP EITF 03-1-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraph 10-18 of EITF 03-1 and 52 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) references existing other-than-temporary impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005 and the Company continued to apply relevant other-than-temporary guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03-1-1 during fiscal 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of the guidance of FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 will have a significant effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No.03-10, Application of Issue No.02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendors sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Companys fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-10 did not affect the Companys consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. Had the Companys first half of fiscal 2004 and all of fiscal 2003 been reported under EITF 03-10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by approximately $186,900 and $282,300, respectively.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal years to conform to the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year.
Note 2Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is net income, plus certain other items that are recorded directly to stockholders equity. Comprehensive income was $1,204,987 for fiscal 2005, $976,517 for fiscal 2004 and $800,745 for fiscal 2003. Foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments are the primary components applied to net income to calculate the Companys comprehensive income and totaled $146,273 and ($4,378), respectively, for fiscal 2005, $94,264 and ($140), respectively, for fiscal 2004, and $79,745 and $0, respectively, for fiscal 2003.

In April 2003, the Companys wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $36,516, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on April26, 2010.
The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary.
On August19, 1997, the Company completed the sale of $900,000 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes (the Notes) due August19, 2017. The Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3 1 / 2 %, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $449,640. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 9,430,147 shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.00. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase the Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) on August19, 2007, or 2012. The Company, at its option, may redeem the Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time on or after August19, 2002. As of August28, 2005, $329,163 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $280,811 in principal was converted in fiscal 2005.
In February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October23, 2001, an additional $100,000 in debt securities was registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf registration to $600,000. The $300,000 of 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes issued in March 2002 reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to $300,000.
At August28, 2005, the fair value of the 5 1 / 2 % Senior Notes, based on market quotes, was approximately $303,150. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The fair value of the 3 1 / 2 % Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes at August28, 2005, based on market quotes, was approximately $405,072. The fair value of other long-term debt approximates carrying value.
Maturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows: 2006 $ 3,225 2007 309,068 2008 60,264 2009 950 2010 64,381 Thereafter 276,012 Total $ 713,900 56 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 4Leases The Company leases land and/or warehouse buildings at 102 of the 433 warehouses open at August28, 2005, and certain other office and distribution facilities under operating leases with remaining terms ranging from 1 to 42 years. These leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a)renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate; (b)purchase of the property at the then fair market value; or (c)right of first refusal in the event of a third party purchase offer. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on the price indices and some of the leases provide for rents based on the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Contingent rents have not been material. The Company accounts for its leases with step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease.
Additionally, the Company leases certain equipment and fixtures under short-term operating leases that permit the Company to either renew for a series of one-year terms or to purchase the equipment at the then fair market value.
Aggregate rental expense for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $131,690, $113,681 and $103,134, respectively. The amount for 2005 excludes $15,999 in rent expense associated with the correction made in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to the Companys method of accounting for ground leases that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. Future minimum payments, net of sub-lease income of $168,742 for all years combined, during the next five fiscal years and thereafter under non-cancelable leases with terms of at least one year, at August28, 2005, were as follows: 2006 $ 114,682 2007 111,638 2008 107,764 2009 100,332 2010 88,856 Thereafter 1,038,995 Total minimum payments $ 1,562,267 Note 5Stock Options The Companys 1993 Combined Stock Grant and Stock Option Plan (the 1993 plan) provided for the issuance of up to 60million shares of its common stock upon the exercise of stock options and up to 3,333,332 shares through stock grants. During fiscal 2002 the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2002 plan) was adopted following shareholder approval. The 2002 plan authorized 30million shares of common stock for issuance, subject to adjustment. For future grants, the 2002 plan replaces the 1993 plan and the 1993 plan has been amended to provide that no more options or stock grants may be issued under such plan. Any shares under the 1993 plan that remain available for future option grants (and any additional shares that subsequently become available through cancellation of unexercised options outstanding) will be added to the number of shares available for grant under the 2002 plan. The 2002 plan authorizes the Company to grant stock options to eligible employees, directors and consultants. During fiscal 2005 the 2002 plan was amended and is now referred to as the Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan following shareholder approval. The Amended and Restated 2002 plan authorized the issuance of an additional 10million shares for option grants and authorized the award of stock bonuses or stock units in addition to stock option grants currently authorized. The number of shares issued as stock bonuses or stock units is limited to one-third of those available for option grants. Options granted under these plans have a ten-year term and generally have a vesting period of five years. At August28, 2005, options for approximately 26.0million shares were vested and 11.5million shares were available for future grants under the plan.
57 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 5Stock Options (Continued) In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company recognized stock compensation costs of $67,937, $36,508 and $12,069, respectively. The effects of applying SFAS No.123 were substantially less in fiscal 2003 than the effects on net income and earnings per share in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 and expected in future periods because this was the initial year of adoption. Fiscal 2005 and 2004 reflects compensation expense from options granted in that year, as well as continuing recognition of expense associated with options issued in prior years as they vest. Shares granted in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled 10,573,953, 7,780,924 and 8,479,550 shares, respectively, with the majority of these shares being granted in the middle of the fiscal third quarter for each fiscal year.
Total stock compensation costs on a pre-tax basis that would have been recorded had SFAS No.123 been adopted as of its initial effective date would have totaled $98,765, $92,679 and $112,863 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Risk free interest rate 4.28% 3.38% 3.30% Expected life 6.6years 6.2years 6.0years Expected volatility 38% 44% 46% Expected dividend yield 1.11% 1.04% 0% Stock option transactions relating to the aggregate of the 1993 and 2002 plans are summarized below (shares in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Shares Price(1) Shares Price(1) Shares Price(1) Outstanding at beginning of fiscal year 50,534 $ 33.45 48,790 $ 31.93 42,961 $ 31.49 Granted(2) 10,574 44.07 7,781 37.19 8,480 30.47 Exercised (9,138 ) 30.44 (5,153 ) 24.23 (2,154 ) 16.13 Cancelled (685 ) 36.44 (884 ) 36.27 (497 ) 37.14 Outstanding at end of fiscal year 51,285 $ 36.14 50,534 $ 33.45 48,790 $ 31.93 (1) Weighted-average exercise price/grant price.

Note 6Retirement Plans The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan that is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90 days of employment. For all U.S. employees, with the exception of California union employees, the plan allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first one thousand dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each eligible participant a contribution based on salary and years of service.
California union employees participate in a defined benefit plan sponsored by their union. The Company makes contributions based upon its union agreement. For all the California union employees, the Company sponsored 401(k) plan currently allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first five hundred dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each eligible participant a contribution based on hours worked and years of service. The Company has a defined contribution plan for Canadian and United Kingdom employees and contributes a percentage of each employees salary. The Company complies with government requirements related to retirement benefits for other international operations and accrues expenses based on a percentage of each employees salary as appropriate.
Amounts expensed under these plans were $191,651, $169,664 and $149,392 for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has defined contribution 401(k) and retirement plans only, and thus has no liability for post-retirement benefit obligations under SFAS No.106 Employers Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other than Pensions.

The effective income tax rate on earnings was 31.4% in fiscal 2005, 37% in fiscal 2004, and 37.8% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 is primarily attributable to a $54,155 income tax benefit resulting from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996-2003) and a net tax benefit on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $30,602, resulting from excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings and recognized a tax expense of $10,010, resulting from tax expense on translation gains accumulated to the date that the Company determined that certain unremitted foreign earnings were no longer permanently reinvested. The net benefit of $20,592 relates to that portion of unremitted foreign earnings that the Company plans to repatriate in the foreseeable future. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the effective tax rate was 28.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of $20,592, as noted above, and a tax benefit of $13,895 primarily associated with lower state taxes. The state tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated effective state tax rate utilized in the first through third quarters of fiscal 2005. Excluding the benefit of these two items, the fourth quarter tax rate for fiscal 2005 would be 35.8%.
The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. affiliates aggregating $865,579 and $857,963 at August28, 2005, and August29, 2004, respectively, as such earnings are deemed permanently reinvested. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits and complexity of the computation, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability or benefit associated with such earnings if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested.
61 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 8Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company is a defendant in two actions purportedly brought as class actions on behalf of certain present and former Costco managers in California, in which plaintiffs allege that they have not been properly compensated for overtime work. The Company is also a defendant in an overtime compensation case purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs allege that Costcos semi-annual bonus formula is improper with regard to retroactive overtime pay. The Company is also a defendant in an action purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs allege that Costco did not properly compensate and record hours worked by employees, and failed to provide meal and rest breaks. Claims in these four actions are made under various provisions of the California Labor Code and the California Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek restitution/disgorgement, compensatory damages, various statutory penalties, liquidated damages, punitive, treble and exemplary damages, and attorneys fees. The Company also is a defendant in an action purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, exemplary and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. In none of these five cases has the Court been asked yet to determine whether the action should proceed as a class action or, if so, the definition of the class. The Company expects to vigorously defend these actions and does not believe that any claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of its operations.
