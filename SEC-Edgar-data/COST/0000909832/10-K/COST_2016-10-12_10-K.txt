3 Table of Contents PART I Item1Business Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, we merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of our non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., we changed our name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August30, 1999, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed our name to Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol COST.
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2011, 2010, and 2009 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August28, 2011,August29, 2010, and August30, 2009, respectively.
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea, and a 50% owned joint venture in Mexico (Mexico). At the beginning of fiscal 2011, we began consolidating our Mexico joint venture due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Mexicos results previously were accounted for under the equity method and our 50% share was included in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. In the current year, the financial position and results of Mexicos operations are fully consolidated and the joint venture partners 50% share is included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income. The initial consolidation of Mexico increased total assets, liabilities, and revenue by approximately 3%, with no impact on net income or net income per common share attributable to Costco. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report.
General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters.
We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (depot) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor.
Because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available. To the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital.
4 Table of Contents Item1Business (Continued) Our typical warehouse format averages approximately 143,000 square feet; newer units tend to be slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales in the last several fiscal yearswell below those of typical discount retail operations.
We generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail to prospective new members, and regular direct marketing programs (such as The Costco Connection, a magazine we publish for our members, coupon mailers, weekly email blasts from costco.com, and handouts) to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers.
Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week, open weekdays between 10:00a.m. and 8:30p.m., with earlier weekend closing hours. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers, discount retailers and supermarkets, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking.
Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. Therefore, we carry an average of approximately 3,600 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to 45,000 to 140,000 SKUs or more at discount retailers, supermarkets, and supercenters. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we generally have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty.
Only the 2011 data in the accompanying tables includes Mexico.
The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items: 2011 2010 2009 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, tobacco, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies) 22 % 23 % 23 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, office supplies, cameras, garden and patio, sporting goods, toys, seasonal items and automotive supplies) 17 % 18 % 19 % Food (including dry and institutionally packaged foods) 21 % 21 % 21 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings and small appliances) 10 % 10 % 10 % Fresh Food (including meat, bakery, deli and produce) 12 % 12 % 12 % Ancillary and Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and travel) 18 % 16 % 15 % 5 Table of Contents Item1Business (Continued) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year-end: 2011 2010 2009 Food Court 586 534 521 One-Hour Photo Centers 581 530 518 Optical Dispensing Centers 574 523 509 Pharmacies 529 480 464 Gas Stations 368 343 323 Hearing-Aid Centers 427 357 303 Print Shops and Copy Centers 10 10 10 Car Washes 7 7 2 Number of warehouses 592 540 527 The 2010 and 2009 numbers exclude the 32 warehouses operated in Mexico.
Our electronic commerce businesses, costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada, provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses, in addition to services such as digital photo processing, pharmacy, travel, and membership services.
Our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit cards, American Express and a private label Costco credit card. Losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal, as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made.
We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to name brand items.
Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report.
Membership Policy Our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location in any country. We have two primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual). Our member renewal rate was 89% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86% on a worldwide basis, consistent with recent years. The renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of approximately $50 for the primary and household membership card, with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of approximately $50 (including a free household card). Many of our business members also shop at Costco for their personal needs. Individual (Gold Star) memberships are available to individuals who do not qualify for a Business membership, for an annual fee of approximately $50, which includes a household card.
6 Table of Contents Item1Business (Continued) Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Gold Star 25,000 22,500 21,500 Business 6,300 5,800 5,700 Business, Add-on Primary 4,000 3,300 3,400 Total primary cardholders 35,300 31,600 30,600 Additional cardholders 28,700 26,400 25,400 Total cardholders 64,000 58,000 56,000 The numbers for 2010 and 2009 exclude approximately 2,900 and 2,800 cardholders of Mexico at the end of those years.
Executive membership is available to all members, with the exception of Business Add-on members, in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom for an annual fee of approximately $100. This program, excluding Mexico, offers additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as merchant credit-card processing, auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, check printing services and a high yield savings program. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by country and state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% annual reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. At the end of 2011, 2010, and 2009, Executive members represented 38%, 36%, and 33%, respectively, of our primary membership. Executive members generally spend more than other members, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase.
Labor Our employee count approximated: 2011 2010 2009 Full-time employees 92,000 82,000 79,000 Part-time employees 72,000 65,000 63,000 Total employees 164,000 147,000 142,000 The numbers for 2010 and 2009 exclude approximately 9,000 individuals who were employed by Mexico at the end of those years. Approximately 13,600 hourly employees in certain of our locations (all former Price Company locations) in five states are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. We compete with over 800 warehouse club locations across the U.S. and Canada (Wal-Marts Sams Club and BJs Wholesale Club), and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations. In addition, we compete with a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. Competitors such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kohls and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowes, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Best Buy and Barnes& Noble. Our international operations face similar types of competitors.
7 Table of Contents Item1Business (Continued) Regulation Certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, and gasoline. While compliance with such laws may cause us to charge higher prices, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and we believe that compliance with such laws currently in effect do not have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. If enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations.
Intellectual Property We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success. Our failure to continue to develop, maintain, and protect these properties would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale  series of trademarks and our private label brand, Kirkland Signature  . We believe that Kirkland Signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to increase the sales penetration of our private label items in the future. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate.

1993 62 9 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.
We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could negatively affect our financial performance.
The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries. We compete with a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, and store hours. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do.
General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance.
Higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscal and tax policies and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. Prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can also increase our merchandise costs and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events.
Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets.
Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property, and build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses, which may have a material adverse affect on our future growth and profitability.
10 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas, a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses.
We also intend to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. In new markets, we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our United States and Canada operations.
Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our United States and Canada operations, which comprised 89% and 83% of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2011, respectively. Within the United States, we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 24% of consolidated net sales in 2011. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our United States operations, particularly in California, and our Canada operations could arise from, among other things: failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members.
We depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner.
We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise, leading to loss of sales and profits.
We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volume we demand may not be consistently available.
Our suppliers are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions, that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal or regulatory stan 11 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) dards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business.
Disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.
We depend on the orderly operation of the receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor shortages and disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members.
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on margins and operating income.
Our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our financial results.
Membership loyalty is essential to our business model. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, lower employee morale and productivity, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, membership fee revenues, resulting in a reduction in shareholder value.
In addition, we sell many products under our owned and exclusive Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our Kirkland Signature products for our customers is essential to developing and maintaining customer loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.
Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.
Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, sales returns reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs, inventories, vendor rebates and other consideration, self-insurance liabilities, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes 12 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted. This legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. We expect our healthcare costs to increase, but not materially, as a result of this legislation. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Unfavorable changes in tax rates could adversely affect our operations, financial conditions or cash flows.
We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, any change in the enacted tax rates, any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction, including transfer pricing disputes, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could make our financial results inaccurate or untimely.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to and cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.
We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our business.
Although we believe that we have independent, redundant, and primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain 13 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
We expect to make significant technology investments in the coming years, which are key to managing our business. We must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace. Excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs may result in the loss of our competitive position or underlying financial data. Additionally, the costs, potential problems, and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or provide them in a delayed or more costly manner.
Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
During 2011, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% of our consolidated net sales. We plan to continue expanding our international operations. As a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the United States, we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many beyond our control and similar to those we face in the United States. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws and regulations of foreign governments and the United States (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the United States. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations.
Market expectations for our financial performance is high.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, margins, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies.
14 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our financial performance.
Natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, particularly in California or in Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. Public health issues, such as a potential H1N1 flu (swine flu) pandemic, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers.
Factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
We use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. Increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. We also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation. Climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.
We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and other environmental matters.
Any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs.
We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, other government investigations, consumer, employment, tort and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report). We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and 15 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources. Our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties.
We are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products.
If our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs and childrens products, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safely standards or our members expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. The sale of these items involves the risk of injury to our members. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases. Our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term.
Our success depends on the continued contributions of management and on our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees.
Our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such person(s) could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other than an annual agreement with our CEO, Mr.Sinegal, we have no employment agreements with our officers. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company does not maintain key man insurance.
If we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and business information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.
We receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our members. In addition, our online operations at www.costco.com and www.costco.ca depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our members personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquid- 16 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) ity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.
Additionally, the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the international, federal and state levels.Privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.
Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business.

19 Table of Contents Item6Selected Financial Data The following table sets forth certain information concerning our consolidated financial condition, operating results, and key operating metrics. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Item7 and our consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report.
At the beginning of fiscal 2011, we began consolidating our 50% owned Mexico joint venture (Mexico) on a prospective basis due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Mexicos results for the prior years were accounted for under the equity method and our 50% share was included in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income in Item8. In the current year, the financial position and results of Mexicos operations are fully consolidated and the joint venture partners 50% share is included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income in Item8 of this Report. The initial consolidation of Mexico increased total assets, liabilities, and revenue by approximately 3%, with no impact on net income or net income per common share attributable to Costco. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report.

20 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) OVERVIEW We believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth (sales in warehouses open for at least one year). Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit. Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). The higher our comparable sales the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, including a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet-based retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. Our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authorityconsistently providing the most competitive values. This may cause us, for example, to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members, negatively impacting gross margin.
We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger and better-located facilities. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. However, the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are ameliorated. Our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.
Our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
Key items for 2011 included:  Net sales increased 14.2% to $87,048, driven by a 10% increase in comparable sales and sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2011. Net sales were favorably impacted by increases in the price of gasoline and by foreign currencies strengthening against the U.S. dollar; 21 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued)  Membership fees increased 10.4% to $1,867, primarily due to the increased penetration of the higher-fee Executive Membership program and new membership sign-ups;  Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points and included a pre-tax last in, first out (LIFO) inventory charge of $87. There was no LIFO charge in 2010;  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 31 basis points;  Net income attributable to Costco increased 12.2% to $1,462, or $3.30 per diluted share compared to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share in 2010. The previously mentioned LIFO charge negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.12;  The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share;  We repurchased 8,939,000 shares of our common stock, at an average cost of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641;  The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $4,000 of our common stock under a repurchase program expiring in April 2015; and  In August 2011, we announced the retirement of Jim Sinegal as our Chief Executive Officer, effective January1, 2012. The Board of Directors elected Craig Jelinek, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January1, 2012. Mr.Sinegal will remain with Costco in an advisory role until February 2013. In addition, he will continue to serve on the Board of Directors.
Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.
Only the 2011 data in the accompanying tables includes Mexico.
Results of Operations Net Sales 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 87,048 $ 76,255 $ 69,889 Net sales increase (decrease) 14.2 % 9.1 % (1.5 %) Increase (decrease) in comparable sales 10 % 7 % (4 %) Warehouse openings, net 20 13 15 2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales Net sales increased $10,793 or 14.2% during 2011 compared to 2010. Excluding sales of Mexico, the increase would have been 11%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, and the remainder primarily from sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011 (24 opened, and four closed, two due to relocation and two temporarily closed for repairs due to damage caused by the March11, 2011 Japan earthquake, one of which remained closed as of the end of 2011).
22 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2011 by approximately $1,308, or 172 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price increases during 2011 by approximately $1,699, or 223 basis points, which resulted from a 24% increase in the average sales price per gallon.
Our sales results continued to be impacted, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2010, by general economic conditions, and those conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment.
Comparable Sales Comparable sales, including Mexico for both this year and last year, increased 10% during 2011, and were positively impacted by increases in the average amount spent by our members and in their shopping frequency. The strengthening of foreign currencies favorably impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,260, or 162 basis points during 2011. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $1,679, or 220 basis points during 2011. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).
2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Net sales increased $6,366 or 9.1% during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and the remainder primarily from sales at the 13 net new warehouses opened during 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation).
Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2010 by approximately $1,570 or 225 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price inflation during 2010 by approximately $895, or 128 basis points, which resulted from a 17% increase in the average sales price per gallon.
Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 7% in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency. Strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,510, or 217 basis points, in 2010. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $882, or 126 basis points, during 2010. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).
Membership Fees 2011 2010 2009 Membership fees $ 1,867 $ 1,691 $ 1,533 Membership fees increase 10.4 % 10.3 % 1.8 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.15 % 2.22 % 2.19 % Total cardholders (000s) 64,000 58,000 56,000 23 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2011 vs. 2010 Membership fees increased 10.4% in 2011. Excluding membership fees from Mexico, the increase would have been 8.3% in 2011. This increase was due to the higher penetration of our higher-fee Executive Membership program and the additional membership sign-ups at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011. Our member renewal rates are consistent with recent years, currently at 89% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86% on a worldwide basis.
Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted membership fees in 2011 by approximately $30.
2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher-fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign-ups at warehouses opened in 2009, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign-ups at the 13 net new warehouses opened in 2010. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2010 was 88% in the U.S. and Canada. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36.
Gross Margin 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin $ 9,309 $ 8,260 $ 7,554 Gross margin increase 12.7 % 9.4 % 1.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.69 % 10.83 % 10.81 % 2011 vs. 2010 Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2010. Gross margin for core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than total net sales, increased 18 basis points, primarily due to hardlines and food and sundries. However, when the core merchandise gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total net sales, it decreased two basis points from the prior year due primarily to the increased sales penetration of the lower-margin gasoline business. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margins decreased by two basis points as a percent of total net sales. The gross margin comparison was negatively impacted by $87 or 10 basis points due to a LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2011. The charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily food and sundries and gasoline. There was no LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2010.
Excluding the impact of consolidating Mexico, the gross margin comparison as a percent of net sales would have been a decrease of 18 basis points during 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin in 2011 by approximately $149.
2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2009. Gross Margin for core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than 24 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) total net sales, increased 25 basis points year-over-year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable $32 LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no LIFO adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two-percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted gross margin by approximately $183.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,682 $ 7,840 $ 7,252 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.97 % 10.28 % 10.38 % 2011 vs. 2010 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 31 basis points compared to 2010; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the decrease was 11 basis points. The year-over-year decrease was due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs, largely payroll. This improvement was partially offset by a non-recurring benefit of $24, or three basis points, recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability.
The consolidation of Mexico, which compared to our other operating segments has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of its own net sales, favorably impacted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A during 2011 by approximately $116.
2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales SG&A expense increased three basis points. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: a $24 refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability; and a $23 charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge in 2010. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140.
Preopening Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Preopening expenses $ 46 $ 26 $ 41 Warehouse openings, including relocations 24 14 19 25 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market.
Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long-lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for impaired assets& closing costs, net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long-lived assets; future lease obligations, including contract termination costs, of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; and accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired. The impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations.
At the end of 2011 and 2010, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties.
Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 116 $ 111 $ 108 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in fiscal 2007. The 5.3% Senior Notes are due March15, 2012.
Interest Income and Other, Net 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest income and other, net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in interest income year-over-year was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, slightly higher interest rates, and the consolidation of our Mexico operations. The decrease in earnings of affiliates and other, net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of Mexico (see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report). In addition, there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $9 and $14 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Derivatives section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report.
26 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010.
The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year.
The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write-down on investments that were non-deductible for tax purposes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short-term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short-term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn.
Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011.
Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short-term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments of $1,828 were held by these non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities.
Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010.
28 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013to 2014 2015to 2016 2017 and thereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise) (1) $ 5,879 $  $  $  $ 5,879 Long-term debt (2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases (3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other) (4) 324 71 19  414 Construction commitments 191    191 Capital lease obligations (2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other (5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.
(2) Includes contractual interest payments.
(3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub-lease income.
(4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
(5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.
Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better-located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re-open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures.

31 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In March 2011, we reclassified our $900 5.3% Senior Notes due March15, 2012, originally issued in February 2007, to a current liability within the current portion of long-term debt within the consolidated balance sheets to reflect its maturity of less than one year. Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances.
In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003.
In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten-year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6-month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi-annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018.
In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary.
In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes.
In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign-exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features.
We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts as of August28, 2011, and August29, 2010.
We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark-to-market adjustment.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements.
Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792.
During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act.
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis.
We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales.
Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period.
Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data.
Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle.
We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year.
Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value.
We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change.
Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate.

Item7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds,U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase.The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields.The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. Arevised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors,limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agencyobligations, repurchase agreementscollateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds.
The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage-backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA+. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations.
Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short-term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre-tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income.
The nature and amount of our long and short-term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed-rate long-term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long-term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6-month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item8 of this Report for more information on our long and short-term debt.
36 Table of Contents Item7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency-Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August28, 2011, and August29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August28, 2011 and August29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively.

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal year that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
The certifications required by Section302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as Exhibit 31.1 to this report.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2011, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August28, 2011. The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August28, 2011 and August29, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August28, 2011,August29, 2010, and August30, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated October14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
/s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington October14, 2011 42 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Costco Wholesale Corporation: We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting included in Item9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August28, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August28, 2011 and August29, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the 52-week periods ended August28, 2011,August29, 2010, and August30, 2009, and our report dated October14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

47 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, a Washington corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest, consolidated entities in which it has made equity investments or has other interests through which it has majority-voting control or it exercises the right to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys performance (Costco or the Company). The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Companys equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and other consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation.
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended guidance concerning whether a companys variable interest(s) in an entity constitute a controlling financial interest. The Company adopted this guidance on August30, 2010 (at the beginning of its fiscal year 2011). As a result of the adoption, the Company determined that its 50%-owned joint venture, Costco Mexico (Mexico), would be consolidated on a prospective basis beginning August30, 2010. Costco operates 32 warehouses in Mexico similar to Costco warehouses operated elsewhere.
Historically, the Company accounted for its 50% interest in Mexico under the equity method of accounting. The Companys equity method investment in Mexico included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of August29, 2010 totaled $357, which was derecognized as part of the initial consolidation of the joint venture on August30, 2010. Total assets and liabilities increased by approximately 3% due to the initial consolidation and the 50% noncontrolling interest in Mexico of $357 was recorded as a component of equity as a result of the initial consolidation. The initial consolidation of Mexico had no impact on net income or net income per common share attributable to Costco (Net Income). The Companys net income excludes income attributable to noncontrolling interests in its operations in Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan. In December 2010, the Company and its 50% joint venture partner amended the Mexico joint venture agreements. As a result, the Company obtained, subject to certain continuing conditions, majority-voting control of the joint venture. As the Company had previously consolidated the joint venture, these amendments did not impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.
The Company operates membership warehouses that offer low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories in no-frills, self-service facilities. At August28, 2011, Costco operated 592 warehouses worldwide which included: 429 U.S. locations (in 40 U.S. states and Puerto Rico), 82 Canadian locations (in nine Canadian provinces), 32 Mexico locations, 22 United Kingdom locations, nine Japan locations, eight Taiwan locations, seven Korea locations, and three Australia locations.
Fiscal Year End The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August31. References to 2011, 2010, and 2009 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August28, 2011,August29, 2010, and August30, 2009, respectively.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 48 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Companys previously reported consolidated financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of less than one week. Credit and debit card receivables were $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Short-term Investments In general, short-term investments have a maturity of three months to five years at the date of purchase. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Companys determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and all are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Companys investments, derivative instruments, and fixed rate debt.
The Company follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements relating to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities, including the presentation of required disclosures, in its consolidated financial statements. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used are: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
49 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value: Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments, such as money market mutual funds, whose value is based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market, exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.
Level 2 includes assets and liabilities where quoted market prices are unobservable but observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities, or could be obtained from data providers or pricing vendors. The Companys Level 2 assets and liabilities primarily include United States (U.S.) government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured corporate bonds, investments in corporate notes and bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, and forward foreign exchange contracts. Valuation methodologies are based on consensus pricing, using market prices from a variety of industry-standard independent data providers or pricing that considers various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, for which the Company typically receives independent external valuation information.
Level 3 is comprised of significant unobservable inputs for valuations from the Companys independent data and a primary pricing vendor that are also supported by little, infrequent, or no market activity. Management considers indicators of significant unobservable inputs such as the lengthening of maturities, later-than-scheduled payments, and any remaining individual securities that have otherwise matured, as indicators of Level 3. Assets and liabilities are considered Level 3 when their fair value inputs are unobservable, unavailable or management concludes that even though there may be some observable inputs, an item should be classified as a Level 3 based on other indicators of significant unobservable inputs, such as situations involving limited market activity, where determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. The Company utilizes the services of a primary pricing vendor, which does not provide access to its proprietary valuation models, inputs and assumptions. While the Company is not provided access to proprietary models of the vendor, the Company reviewed and contrasted pricing received with other pricing sources to ensure accuracy of each asset class for which prices are provided. The Companys review also included an examination of the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes, credit rating levels and various durations, a process that is continually performed for each reporting period. In addition, the pricing vendor has an established challenge process in place for all security valuations, which facilitates identification and resolution of potentially erroneous prices. The Company believes that the prices received from the primary pricing vendor are representative of exit prices in accordance with authoritative guidance, and are classified appropriately in the fair value hierarchy.
Our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt, which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized discount.

Vendor receivable balances are generally presented on a gross basis separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by other systematic approach.
Reinsurance receivables are held by the Companys wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. The receivable balance represents amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements, and are reflected on a gross basis, separate from the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented on a gross basis within other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Receivables from governmental entities largely consists of various tax related items.
Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members insurance companies for the amount above their co-pay, which is collected at the point-of-sale.
Amounts are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and application of the specific identification method. Write-offs of receivables were immaterial for fiscal years 2011, 2010, or 2009.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories consist of the following at the end of 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 United States (primarily LIFO) $ 4,548 $ 4,150 Foreign (FIFO) 2,090 1,488 Merchandise Inventories $ 6,638 $ 5,638 51 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.
Due to inflation in 2011, the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle.
The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based on the Companys experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. In general, new building additions are separated into components, each with its own estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or the lease term, if shorter. Leasehold improvements incurred after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvement is made.
Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: Years Buildings and improvements 5-50 Equipment and fixtures 3 - 20 Repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Assets that were removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. When assets are retired or sold, the asset costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any remaining gain or loss recorded.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when relocating or closing a warehouse or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups 52 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) to be held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the groups net carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss would be recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held for sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal groups fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or other valuation techniques. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $1, $2, and $11, respectively, included in provision for impaired assets and closing costs, net and interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income. In 2009, the charge was primarily related to the closure of its two Costco Home locations in July 2009.
Assets classified as held for sale were not material as of August28, 2011 or August29, 2010.
Other Assets Other assets consist of the following at the end of 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Prepaid rents, lease costs, and long-term deposits $ 211 $ 186 Tax-related assets 179 18 Goodwill, net 74 71 Cash surrender value of life insurance 64 65 Other 95 96 Investment in Mexico 0 357 Other Assets $ 623 $ 793 As previously discussed, the Company began consolidating Mexico at the beginning of 2011, on a prospective basis. The amount of retained earnings that represented undistributed earnings of Mexico was $307 at the end of 2010. The Company did not make any capital contributions to its investment in Mexico in 2010 or 2009. The investments and equity in earnings of other unconsolidated joint ventures are not material.
Tax-related assets represent amounts deposited with taxing authorities in connection with ongoing income tax audits and the Companys long term deferred tax assets.
Goodwill resulting from certain business combinations is reviewed for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. No impairment of goodwill has been incurred to date.
The Company adjusts the carrying value of its employee life insurance contracts to the net cash surrender value at the end of each reporting period.
53 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Accounts Payable The Companys banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Accordingly, included in accounts payable at the end of 2011 and 2010 are $108 and $617, respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were drawn.
Insurance/Self-Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance program, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next fiscal year. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. As of the end of 2011 and 2010, these insurance liabilities were $595 and $541 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accounts payable, accrued salaries and benefits, and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.
The Companys wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Companys premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party members. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance program limit any participating members individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the annual agreement.
Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities consist of the following at the end of 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Accrued member rewards $ 602 $ 522 Insurance-related liabilities 276 263 Tax-related liabilities 122 79 Cash card liability 112 100 Deferred sales 141 98 Other current liabilities 96 86 Vendor consideration liabilities 66 57 Sales return reserve 74 72 Interest payable 51 51 Other Current Liabilities $ 1,540 $ 1,328 54 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. The Company manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Companys international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. The aggregate notional amounts of forward foreign-exchange contracts were $247 and $225 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The Company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the Company has an established banking relationship. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. The contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts as of August28, 2011, and August29, 2010.
The amount of net foreign-currency transaction gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income relating to forward foreign-exchange contracts were nominal in 2011, 2010 and 2009. These gains and losses are largely offset by the impact of revaluing related foreign currency denominated payables, which are also recognized in interest income and other, net.
The Company is exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for the energy it consumes, particularly electricity and natural gas, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for approximately 36% of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark-to-market adjustment.
Foreign-Currency The functional currencies of the Companys international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Revenues and expenses of the Companys consolidated foreign operations are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
The Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, generally the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries to their functional currency, in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. These gains and losses were $8 and $13 in 2011 and 2010, respectively and not significant in 2009.
55 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Revenue Recognition The Company generally recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When the Company collects payments from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amounts received are generally recorded as deferred sales included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company reserves for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis.
The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales.
Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of the Companys members. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. As previously disclosed, effective with renewals occurring on and after March1, 2009, the Company changed an element of its membership renewal policy. Memberships renewed within two months after expiration of the current membership year are extended for twelve months from the expiration date. (Under the previous policy, renewals within six months of the expiration date were extended for twelve months from the expiration date.) Memberships renewed more than two months after such expiration date are extended for twelve months from the renewal date. This change has had an immaterial effect of deferring recognition of certain membership fees paid by late-renewing members.
The Companys Executive Members qualify for a 2% reward (up to a maximum of approximately five hundred dollars per year on qualified purchases made at Costco), which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, with the related accrued member rewards liability included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. The net reduction in sales was $790, $688, and $610 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Companys depot operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits and depreciation on production equipment in certain fresh foods and ancillary departments.
56 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers compensation costs for warehouse employees, other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include utilities, bank charges, rent and substantially all building and equipment depreciation, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.
Marketing and Promotional Expenses Costcos policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. Marketing and promotional costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted is recognized using the straight-line method. The fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model. While options and RSUs granted to employees generally vest over five years, all grants allow for either daily or quarterly vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. The historical experience rate of actual forfeitures has been minimal. As such, the Company does not reduce stock-based compensation for an estimate of forfeitures because the estimate is inconsequential in light of historical experience and considering the awards vest on either a daily or quarterly basis. The impact of actual forfeitures arising in the event of involuntary termination is recognized as actual forfeitures occur, which generally has been infrequent. Stock options have a ten-year term. Stock-based compensation expense is predominately included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 7 for additional information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans.
Leases The Company leases land and/or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities primarily under operating leases. Operating leases expire at various dates through 2051, with the exception of one lease in the Companys United Kingdom subsidiary, which expires in 2151. These leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a)renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b)purchase of the property at the then-fair market value; or (c)right of first refusal in the event of a third party purchase offer.
The Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease, from the date the Company has control of the 57 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) property. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on the price indices, and some of the leases provide for rents based on the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume.
The Company has entered into four capital leases for warehouse locations, expiring at various dates through 2040. Capital lease assets are included in buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense on capital lease assets is recorded as depreciation expense and is predominately included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Capital lease liabilities are recorded at the lesser of the estimated fair market value of the leased property or the net present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments and are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities. Interest on these obligations is included in interest expense.
Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.
Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net Warehouse closing costs incurred relate principally to expenses associated with the Companys relocation of certain warehouses (that were not otherwise impaired) to larger and better-located facilities. The provisions for 2011, 2010, and 2009 included charges in the amounts indicated below: 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long-lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 Warehouse closing expenses primarily relate to accelerated building depreciation based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date and remaining lease obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for leased locations. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the Companys reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5 and primarily related to estimated future lease obligations and other estimated contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties.
Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net includes: 2011 2010 2009 Interest income, net $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest Income and Other, Net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 As previously discussed, Costco began consolidating Mexico at the beginning of 2011, on a prospective basis. For 2010 and 2009, the equity in earnings of Mexico is included in interest income and other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, and was $41 and $32, respectively.
58 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company recognizes the credit loss component in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. The Company generally only invests in debt securities.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.
The determination of the Companys provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Companys consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. See Note 9 for additional information.
Net Income Attributable to Costco per Common Share The computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise and vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to stock options and restricted stock units and the if converted method for the convertible note securities.
Stock Repurchase Programs Repurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. See Note 6 for additional information.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements As discussed above in Note 1, the Company adopted guidance related to consolidation of variable interest entities.
59 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) In October 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance on revenue recognition for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. Under this guidance, when vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling-price method. This guidance also prescribes disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of its fiscal year 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. Under Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy, the guidance requires disclosure of information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis (as opposed to a net basis) in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured. The Company adopted this guidance at the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal 2010, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures on the roll-forward activities, which were adopted at the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statement disclosures.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend the requirements related to fair value measurement which changes the wording used to describe many requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. Additionally, the amendments clarify the FASBs intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011, and is applied prospectively. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal year 2012. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statement disclosure.
In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.Instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or to present the information in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance must be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. The Company plans to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its third quarter of fiscal 2012. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and will impact the financial statements presentation only.
In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the rules related to testing goodwill for impairment. The revised guidance allows an entity to make an initial qualitative evaluation, based on the entitys events and circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The results of this qualitative assessment determine whether it is necessary to perform the currently required two-step impairment test. The new 60 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company plans to early adopt this guidance for its fiscal year 2012 annual impairment test. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Note 2Investments The major categories of the Companys investments are as follows: Money market mutual funds The Company invests in money funds that seek to maintain a net asset value of par, while limiting overall exposure to credit, market, and liquidity risks.
U.S. government and agency securities These U.S. government-secured debt instruments are publically traded and valued. Losses in this category are primarily due to market liquidity and interest rate reductions.
Corporate notes and bonds The Company evaluates its corporate debt securities based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the credit rating of the issuer. The vast majority of the Companys corporate debt securities are rated investment grade by the major rating agencies.
FDIC-insured corporate bonds These bonds are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. Losses in this category are primarily due to market liquidity and interest rate reductions.
Asset and mortgage-backed securities The vast majority of the Companys asset and mortgage-backed securities have investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. These investments are collateralized by residential real estate, credit card receivables, commercial real estate, foreign mortgage receivables, and lease receivables. Estimates of fair value are based upon a variety of factors including, but not limited to, credit rating of the issuer, internal credit risk, interest rate variation, prepayment assumptions, and the potential for default.
Certificates of deposit Certificate of deposits are short-term interest-bearing debt instruments issued by various financial institutions with which the Company has an established banking relationship.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include held-to-maturity investments that are carried at amortized cost and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis. There were no fair value adjustments to these financial assets measured during the 2011 and 2010.
Nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as long lived assets that are measured at fair value resulting from an impairment, if deemed necessary. Fair value adjustments to these nonfinancial assets and liabilities during 2011 and 2010 were immaterial.
Note 4Debt Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs The Company enters into various short-term bank credit facilities. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the total amount of credit under these facilities was $391 and $341, respectively. The total amount outstanding was $26 at the end of 2010.

Interest is payable semi-annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018.
In October 2007, the Companys Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and principal is due in October 2017. The Company guarantees all financing instruments issued by its Japanese subsidiary.

Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. The Company, at its option, may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In March 2011, the Company reclassified its 2012 Notes, to a current liability within the current portion of long-term debt of the consolidated balance sheets to reflect its remaining maturity of less than one year.
In August 1997, the Company sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax where applicable, were as follows: 2011 2010 Unrealized gains on short-term investments $ 7 $ 6 Foreign-currency translation adjustment and other 366 116 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ 373 $ 122 68 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 7Stock-Based Compensation Plans Through the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company granted stock options under the Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Second Restated 2002 Plan) and predecessor plans. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company has granted RSUs under the Second Restated 2002 Plan. In July 2008 the Third Restated 2002 Plan was amended by the Board of Directors (Fourth Restated 2002 Plan). Under the Fourth Restated 2002 Plan, prospective grants of RSUs are subject, upon certain terminations of employment, to quarterly, as opposed to daily vesting. Previously awarded RSU grants continue to involve daily vesting upon certain terminations of employment. Additionally, employees who attain certain years of service with the Company will receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions on the annual vesting date rather than upon qualified retirement. The first grant impacted by these amendments occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Fourth Restated 2002 Plan was amended following shareholder approval and is now referred to as the Fifth Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Fifth Restated 2002 Plan). The Fifth Restated 2002 Plan authorizes the issuance of an additional 18,000,000 shares (10,285,714 RSUs) of common stock for future grants in addition to grants currently authorized. Each share issued in respect of stock bonuses or stock units is counted as 1.75 shares toward the limit of shares available. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs.

Employee Tax Consequences on Certain Stock Options In 2010, the Company recorded a non-recurring benefit of $24 to selling, general and administrative expense related to a refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity RSUs granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five years and three years, respectively; however, the Company provides for accelerated vesting for employees that have attained twenty-five or more years of service with the Company. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested shares. At the end of 2011, 8,565,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs to eligible employees and directors under the Fifth Restated 2002 Plan.
The following awards were outstanding at the end of 2011:  9,010,000 shares of time-based RSUs that vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time; and  717,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 315,000 will be formally granted to certain executive officers of the Company upon the official certification of the attainment of specified performance targets for 2011.

Note 8Retirement Plans The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan that is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90 days of employment. For all U.S. employees, with the exception of California union employees, the plan allows pre-tax deferrals against which the Company matches 50% of the first one thousand dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution based on salary and years of service.
California union employees participate in a defined benefit plan sponsored by their union. The Company makes contributions based upon its union agreement. For all the California union employees, the Company-sponsored 401(k) plan currently allows pre-tax deferrals against which the Company matches 50% of the first five hundred dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each eligible participant a contribution based on hours worked and years of service.
The Company has a defined contribution plan for Canadian and United Kingdom employees and contributes a percentage of each employees salary. Certain other foreign operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans that are not material. Amounts expensed under all plans were $345, $313, and $287 for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and were included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs on the consolidated statements of income.

The reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2011, 2010, and 2009 is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Federal taxes at statutory rate $ 834 35.0 % $ 718 35.0 % $ 604 35.0 % State taxes, net 55 2.4 56 2.7 48 2.8 Foreign taxes, net (66 ) (2.8 ) (38 ) (1.9 ) (24 ) (1.4 ) Other 18 0.7 (5 ) (0.2 ) 0 0 Total $ 841 35.3 % $ 731 35.6 % $ 628 36.4 % The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 2011 2010 Equity compensation $ 89 $ 112 Deferred income/membership fees 134 118 Accrued liabilities and reserves 429 392 Other 32 35 Total deferred tax assets 684 657 Property and equipment 494 414 Merchandise inventories 164 170 Total deferred tax liabilities 658 584 Net deferred tax assets $ 26 $ 73 72 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 9Income Taxes (Continued) The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2011 and 2010 include current deferred income tax assets of $360 and $307, respectively, included in deferred income taxes and other current assets; non-current deferred income tax assets of $53 and $10, respectively, included in other assets; and non-current deferred income tax liabilities of $387 and $244, respectively, included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities.
The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, aggregating to $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011and 2010, respectively, as such earnings are deemed by the Company to be indefinitely reinvested. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits and complexity of the computation, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability or benefit that would be associated with such earnings if such earnings were not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2011 and 2010 is as follows: 2011 2010 Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 83 $ 80 Gross increasescurrent year tax positions 21 29 Gross increasestax positions in prior years 10 4 Gross decreasestax positions in prior years (6 ) (1 ) Settlements (1 ) (27 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (1 ) (2 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 106 $ 83 Included in the balance at the end of 2011, are $64 of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $34 and $27 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. The Company recognized $2 of expense and $7 of income related to interest and penalties in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties are $12 and $9 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The Company is currently under audit by several taxing jurisdictions in the United States and in several foreign countries. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months and the unrecognized tax benefits we have recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not possible to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.

With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2007. The Company is currently subject to examination in Canada for fiscal years 2006 to present and in California for fiscal years 2004 to present. No other examinations are believed to be material.

The Company is a defendant in the following matters, among others: A class action was filed on May15, 2009, on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which the plaintiff principally alleges that the Companys routine closing procedures and security checks cause employees to incur delays that qualify as uncompensated working time. Mary Pytelewski v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Superior Court for the County of San Diego, Case No.37-2009-00089654. The case was removed to the United States District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego), Case No.09-CV-02473-AJB (BGS). On December14, 2010, the court certified two classes of hourly non-exempt employees subject to the Companys closing lockdown procedures: one under California law for California non-union employees who were subject to the closing procedures between May15, 2005, and October1, 2009; and a nationwide class under federal law for full-time employees who were subject to the closing procedures between March1, 2008, and October1, 2009. The case has been renamed Eric Stiller v. Costco Wholesale Corp. and the parties are conducting discovery. A similar class action was filed on November20, 2009, in the State of Washington.

On July14, 2010, a putative class action was filed alleging that the Company unlawfully failed to pay overtime compensation, denied meal and rest breaks, failed to pay minimum wages, failed to provide accurate wage-itemization statements, and willfully failed to pay termination wages allegedly resulting from misclassification of certain California department managers as exempt employees. On September3, 2010, the Company removed the case to federal court. The court remanded the action, and the Companys petition to the Ninth Circuit for permission to appeal the remand order was denied. On June24, 2011, defendants filed a motion to strike the class and certain other allegations from the complaint. On July26, 2011, the court granted the motion in part, without leave to amend, striking allegations predating December31, 2008, which are covered by a prior class settlement. The Court also granted the motion with respect to allegations post-dating December31, 2008, but granted plaintiff leave to amend. On August25, 2011, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and on September20, 2011, defendants renewed the motion to strike. The motion is set for hearing on October13, 2011. Manuel Medrano v.

The Company has been named as a defendant in two purported class actions relating to sales of organic milk. Hesse v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. C07-1975 (W.D. Wash.); Snell v. Aurora Dairy Corp., et al., No.07-CV-2449 (D. Col.). Both actions claim violations of the laws of various states, essentially alleging that milk provided to Costco by its supplier Aurora Dairy Corp. was improperly labeled organic. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on July18, 2008. With respect to the Company, plaintiffs seek to certify four classes of people who purchased Costco organic milk. Aurora has maintained that it has held and continues to hold valid organic certifications. The consolidated complaint seeks, among other things, actual, compensatory, statutory, punitive and/or exemplary damages in unspecified amounts, as well as costs and attorneys fees. On June3, 2009, the district court 76 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 11Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) entered an order dismissing with prejudice, among others, all claims against the Company. As a result of an appeal by the plaintiffs, on September15, 2010, the court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the rulings of the district court and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Plaintiffs have filed amended complaints.
In Verzani, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No.09 CV 2117 (United States District Court for the Southern District of New York), a purported nationwide class action, the plaintiffs allege claims for breach of contract and violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, based on the failure of the Company to disclose on the label of its Shrimp Tray with Cocktail Sauce the weight of the shrimp in the item as distinct from the accompanying cocktail sauce, lettuce, and lemon wedges. The complaint seeks various forms of damages (including compensatory and treble damages and disgorgement and restitution), injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneys fees, costs, and prejudgment interest. On April21, 2009, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prevent the Company from selling the shrimp tray unless the Company separately discloses the weight of the shrimp and provides shrimp consistent with the disclosed weight. By orders dated July29 and August6, 2009, the court denied the preliminary injunction motion and dismissed the claim for breach of contract, and on July21, 2010, the court of appeals summarily affirmed these rulings. On September28, 2010, the district court denied the motion of one plaintiff to file an amended complaint. On September20, 2011, the court of appeals affirmed the rulings of the district court.
In Kilano, et. ano, v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No.2:10-cv-11456-VAR-DAS (United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan), filed on April12, 2010, a purported class action was filed on behalf of certain Michigan Executive level-members who received 2% rewards. Plaintiffs allege that the Company guarantees that the member will receive rewards of no less than the fifty dollar difference between Executive and Gold Star membership and that the Company is required to but has failed to automatically reimburse members whose rewards are less than this difference. Plaintiffs allege violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. They seek compensatory and statutory damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys fees. The Company filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. On April5, 2011, the court denied plaintiffs motion for class certification. On July22, 2011, plaintiffs sought leave to file an amended complaint.
On March15, 2011, Robles, et al., v. Costco Wholesale Corporation was filed as a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Case No.11-CV-1785. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class composed of all disabled persons with ambulatory impairments who depend upon the use of a wheelchair and are allegedly unable to obtain optometry services at the Company. Plaintiffs allege that the Company has failed to remove architectural barriers that prevent full and equal enjoyment of and access to its eye examination services. They allege violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. They seek injunctive relief and compensatory damages, costs, and attorneys fees. The Company has filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint.
Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed, ostensibly on behalf of the Company, against certain of its current and former officers and directors, relating to the Companys stock option grants. One suit, Sandra Donnelly v. James Sinegal, et al., Case No.08-2-23783-4 SEA (King County Superior Court), was filed in Washington state court on or about July17, 2008. Plaintiff alleged, among 77 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in millions, except share data) (Continued) Note 11Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) other things, that individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by backdating grants of stock options issued between 1997 and 2005 to various current and former executives, allegedly in violation of the Companys shareholder-approved stock option plans. On April3, 2009, on the Companys motion the court dismissed the action, following the plaintiffs disclosure that she had ceased to own Costco common stock, a requirement for her to pursue a derivative action. The second action, Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust v. James Sinegal, et al., Case No.2:08-cv-01450-TSZ (United States District Court for the Western District of Washington), was filed on or about September29, 2008, and named as defendants all but one of the Companys directors and certain of its senior executives. Plaintiff alleged that defendants approved the issuance of backdated stock options, concealed the backdating of stock options, and refused to vindicate the Companys rights by pursuing those who obtained improper incentive compensation. The third action, Daniel Buckfire v. James D. Sinegal, et al., No.2:09-cv-00893-TSZ (United States District Court for the Western District of Washington), was filed on or about June29, 2009, and contains allegations substantially similar to those in the Pirelli action. On August12, 2009, the court entered an order consolidating the Pirelli and Buckfire actions. On October2, 2009, plaintiffs Pirelli and Buckfire filed a consolidated amended complaint. On November16, 2009, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint on various grounds, including that plaintiffs failed to properly allege why a pre-suit demand had not been made on the Board of Directors. On September20, 2010, a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs that would terminate the litigation.The agreement, which was subject among other things to federal district court approval, provided that the Company will pay an amount not to exceed $4.85 million in attorneys fees to plaintiffs counsel and will adopt or maintain certain governance, control and other process changes. On December20, 2010, the parties executed a stipulation of settlement, and on January14, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for court approval of the settlement. On February28, 2011, the court entered an order that preliminarily approved, subject to further consideration at a settlement hearing, the proposed settlement of the action involving, among other things, a dismissal of the consolidated derivative actions with prejudice. On June10, 2011, the court granted final approval to the settlement, and the case has been dismissed.
On October4, 2006, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, seeking records relating to the Companys receipt and handling of hazardous merchandise returned by Costco members and other records. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorneys Office.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Information Request to the Company, dated November1, 2007, under the Clean Air Act. The EPA sought records regarding warehouses in the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada relating to compliance with regulations concerning air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. On March4, 2009, the Company was advised by the Department of Justice that the Department was prepared to allege that the Company has committed at least nineteen violations of the leak-repair requirements of 40 C.F.R.  82.156(i) and at least seventy-four violations of the recordkeeping requirements of 40 C.F.R.  82.166(k), (m)at warehouses in these four states. The Company has responded to these allegations, is engaged in communications with the Department about these and additional allegations made by letter dated September10, 2009, and has entered into tolling agreements. Substantial penalties may be levied for violations of the Clean Air Act. The Company is cooperating with this inquiry.

Costco Wholesale Corp., et al, No.37-2009-00099912 (Superior Court for the County of San Diego), alleging on information and belief that the Company has violated and continues to violate provisions of the California Health and Safety Code and the Business and Professions Code through the use of certain spill clean-up materials at its gasoline stations. Relief sought includes, among other things, requests for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, civil penalties, costs and attorneys fees. On September2, 2010, the court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. An amended complaint was filed on September13, 2010.
The Company has received notices from most states stating that they have appointed an agent to conduct an examination of the books and records of the Company to determine whether it has complied with state unclaimed property laws. In addition to seeking the turnover of unclaimed property subject to escheat laws, the states may seek interest, penalties, costs of examinations, and other relief. The State of Washington conducted such an examination on its own behalf and on February4, 2011 issued an assessment. The Company filed suit on March4, 2011, to contest the assessment.
Except where indicated otherwise above, a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time for the matters described. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter.
