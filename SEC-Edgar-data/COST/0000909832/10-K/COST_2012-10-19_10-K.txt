Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules 36 2 Table of Contents PART I Item1Business Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, we merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of our non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., we changed our name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August30, 1999, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington and changed our name to Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol COST.
General We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets and supercenters.
We buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (depot) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive container-based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses, generally in less than twenty-four hours. This maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, thereby lowering our receiving costs by eliminating many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels, which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor.
Because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally have the opportunity to sell and be paid for inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors, even though we take advantage of early payment discounts whenever available to us. As sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by our working capital.
Our typical warehouse format averages approximately 140,000 square feet; newer units tend to be larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses need not have elaborate facilities. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses to less than two-tenths of one percent of net sales in each of the last three fiscal yearswell below those of typical discount retail operations.
We generally limit marketing and promotional activities to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and regular direct marketing programs (such as The Costco Connection, a magazine we publish for our members, and coupon mailers) to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical retailers. In connection with new warehouse openings, our marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members 3 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) are contacted by direct mail or by providing membership offerings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up messages distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective Business and Gold Star members.
Our warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 69-hour week. Generally, warehouses are open weekdays between 10:00a.m. and 8:30p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers, discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking.
Our merchandising strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained elsewhere. An important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which we can provide our members significant savings. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, we carry an average of approximately 4,000 active stockkeeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40,000 SKUs or more. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities only.
In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. In fiscal 2007, we introduced a 90-day return policy in the United States on certain electronic items. Additionally, we now provide, free of charge, technical support service, as well as an extended warranty on certain electronic items.
The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by major category of items: 2007 2006 2005 Sundries (including candy, snack foods, tobacco, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies) 23 % 24 % 25 % Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, office supplies, garden and patio, sporting goods, furniture, and automotive supplies) 21 % 20 % 20 % Food (including dry and institutionally packaged foods) 19 % 19 % 19 % Softlines (including apparel, domestics, jewelry, housewares, media, home furnishings, cameras and small appliances) 11 % 12 % 12 % Fresh Food (including meat, bakery, deli and produce) 12 % 11 % 11 % Ancillary and Other (including gas stations, pharmacy, food court, optical, one-hour photo, hearing aid and travel) 14 % 14 % 13 % 4 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. The following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end: 2007 2006 2005 Food Court and Hot Dog Stands 482 452 427 One-Hour Photo Centers 480 450 423 Optical Dispensing Centers 472 442 414 Pharmacies 429 401 374 Gas Stations 279 250 225 Hearing-Aid Centers 237 196 168 Print Shops and Copy Centers 8 9 10 Number of warehouses 488 458 433 Warehouses operated by our Mexico joint venture are not included above. At September2, 2007, our 50% owned joint venture in Mexico operated 30 warehouses.
Our electronic commerce businesses, costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada, provide our members additional products generally not found in our warehouses, in addition to services such as digital photo processing, pharmacy, travel and membership services.
Our warehouses accept cash, checks, certain debit cards, American Express and a private label Costco credit card. Losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from cashing checks at the point of sale until restitution is made.
We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of merchandise is obtained from any one of these or any other single supplier. We have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase selected private label merchandise, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater.
Financial information of our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 12, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first, second and third quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on our operations, except an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. Fiscal years 2007 and 2005 each consisted of 52 weeks, and fiscal year 2006 was a 53-week year.
Membership Policy Our membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue, which allows us to offer low prices.
Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location in any country. We have two primary types of members: Business, and Gold Star (individual). In addition, U.S. and Canadian 5 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) members can upgrade to an Executive Membership. We continue to experience strong member renewal rates, currently at 87%. Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $50 for the primary and spouse membership card, with add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $40 (including a free spouse card). A significant number of our business members also shop at Costco for their personal needs.
Individual memberships (Gold Star memberships) are available to individuals who do not qualify for a Business membership. Individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of $50, which includes a spouse card.
Our membership base was made up of the following (in thousands): September2, 2007 September3, 2006 Gold Star 18,600 17,300 Business 5,400 5,200 Total primary cardholders 24,000 22,500 Add-on cardholders 26,400 25,200 Total cardholders 50,400 47,700 The rates for Business and Gold Star members discussed above reflect the $5 increase that went into effect on May1, 2006 for new members and July1, 2006 for existing members.
Executive Membership is available to all members in the U.S. and Canada for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit card processing, small business loans, auto and home insurance, business telephone service, check printing, and real estate and mortgage services. The services offered are generally provided by third-party providers and vary by state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. At the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, Executive members represented 23% and 20%, respectively, of our primary membership base and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase.
Labor Our employee count approximated: September2, 2007 September3, 2006 Full-time employees 70,000 66,000 Part-time employees 57,000 53,000 Total employees 127,000 119,000 These numbers exclude approximately 9,000 and 8,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture) as of September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, respectively, which is not consolidated in our financial statements, but is accounted for using the equity method. Approximately 13,900 hourly employees in certain of our locations in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and one warehouse in Virginia are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
6 Table of Contents Item 1Business (Continued) Competition Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. Over 1,200 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including our 454 North American warehouses, and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. In addition to other membership warehouse operators such as Wal-Marts Sams Club and BJs Wholesale Club, we compete with a wide range of national and regional retailers and wholesalers, including supermarkets, supercenters, general merchandise chains, specialty chains, gasoline stations, as well as electronic commerce businesses. Wal-Mart, Target and Kohls are significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowes, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Staples, Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Best Buy and Barnes& Noble.
Regulation Certain state laws require that we apply minimum markups to our selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products, alcoholic beverages and gasoline. While compliance with such laws may cause us to charge somewhat higher prices than we otherwise would charge, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and we believe that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on our operations.
It is our policy to sell at lower than manufacturers suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to us or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, we believe that we have not been materially affected by our inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict our ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices. We cannot predict the effect on our business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation.
Certain states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. We believe that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations.

Item1ARisk Factors Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.
7 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. They could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by our forward-looking statements. Those statements may relate to such matters as sales growth, increases in comparable store sales, impact of cannibalization, price changes, earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, warehouse openings and closures, the effect of adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, strategic direction and the demand for our products and services. You should read these risk factors in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item7 of this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item8 of this Report. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not perceive them to be material, that could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the SEC.
We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could negatively affect our financial performance.
The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, warehouse sites, products and services and in other important respects with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries. We compete with other wholesale club operators, discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as electronic commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter stores, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to members, location, store hours and price. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could negatively affect our financial performance. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do.
General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance.
Higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, fluctuations of certain commodity prices, consumer debt levels, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. These factors can also increase our cost of sales and/or operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and results. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events.
Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing markets and by opening warehouses in new markets.
Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build or lease new warehouses. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of our warehouses, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or 8 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to build or lease new warehouses, which may have a material adverse affect on our future profitability.
We seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas, a new warehouse may draw members away from our nearby existing warehouses and may cause comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses to slow or decline.
We also intend to open warehouses in new markets. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. While we have a track record of profitable growth, in new markets we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability may be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.
Any inability to open new warehouses on schedule could hurt our financial performance.
We expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. Our opening of new warehouses, domestically and internationally, will depend on our ability to: identify and secure suitable locations; negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms; attract and train qualified employees; and manage preopening expenses, including construction costs. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our warehouses. Our ability to open new warehouses also is affected by environmental regulations, local zoning issues and other laws related to land use. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors will affect our ability to open warehouses on schedule, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our United States and Canada operations.
Our financial performance is highly dependent on our United States and Canada operations, which comprised 94% of consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2007 and 2006, and 93% and 94% of operating income in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Furthermore, we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 28% and 31% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our United States and Canada operations could arise from, among other things: failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor and healthcare costs; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets; and failing consistently to provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members.
We depend on vendors to supply us with quality merchandise at the right time and at the right price.
We depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. Sales demands may lead to insufficient in-stock positions of our merchandise.
9 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) We purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers. We have thousands of vendor relationships. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and/or more expensive than those from existing vendors.
Our vendors are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions, that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. For these or other reasons, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our quality control or legal or regulatory standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell to our members. This failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our private label brand, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business.
In addition, the United States foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share.
Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.
Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, sales returns reserve, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs, inventories, self insurance, stock-based compensation, income taxes, unclaimed property laws and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.
Our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
Our international operations could form a larger portion of our business in future years. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations and exchange rates, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, 10 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws and regulations of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the United States.
Implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term and fail to provide the anticipated benefits.
We have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our operations and in our administrative functions. The costs, potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits; it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail.
Market expectations for our financial performance is high.
We believe that the price of our stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet these expectations for our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to drop.
Cost related to natural disasters could unfavorably affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes (particularly in California) could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our depots or warehouses within a country in which we operate and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses.
We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, and other environmental matters.
Any failure to comply with these laws could result in costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our operations.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may unfavorably affect our operations or increase our costs.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including grand jury investigations, consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could unfavorably affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources. Our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines and penalties.
11 Table of Contents Item1ARisk Factors (Continued) Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes: maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.
Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees.
To be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates, while controlling related labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. We also depend on our executives and other key employees for our success. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future.
If we do not maintain the security of member-related information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.
As do most retailers and wholesale club operators, we receive certain personal information about our members.

15 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the end of August. Fiscal years 2007 and 2005 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2006 included 53 weeks, with the extra week included in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Key items for fiscal year 2007 included:  Net sales in fiscal 2007 (52 weeks) increased 7.0% over fiscal 2006 (53 weeks), driven by an increase in comparable sales (sales in warehouses open for at least one year) of 6% and the opening of 30 new warehouses;  Membership fees for fiscal 2007 increased 10.5%, to $1.31 billion, primarily due to the $5 increase in our annual membership fee in 2006 for our non-Executive members;  Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales decreased 3 basis points over the prior year;  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 22 basis points over the prior year;  Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006;  On February20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March15, 2012 and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March15, 2017;  The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share in April 2007; and  We repurchased 36.4million shares of our common stock, expending approximately $1.98 billion at an average cost of $54.39 per share.
Results of Operations (dollars in thousands, except per share and warehouse number data) The following unusual items impacted fiscal 2007 results:  Sales returns reserve: In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy, we completed a review of historical data of trends in sales returns, which indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than was previously estimated. We revised our estimate of our sales returns reserve to include the longer timeframe, as well as a lower realization rate on certain returned items. The effect of the revisions to our estimated reserve resulted in a decrease in net sales of $452.6 million and a charge to gross margin of approximately $94.3 million.
Employee tax consequences on stock options: In connection with the review of stock option grants and guidance issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on November30, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a program intended to protect approximately 1,000 employees who are United States taxpayers from certain adverse tax consequences arising from that review. The program involved increasing the exercise prices on certain stock options granted from 2000 to 2003 and, in turn, making payments to employees in an amount approximately equal to the increase in the exercise price. While we are still examining the availability of similar alternatives for employees outside the United States, we recorded a charge in fiscal 2007 for the estimated amount to remedy adverse tax consequences related to stock options held and previously exercised by employees outside the United States. In aggregate, these charges totaled $47.3 million.
16 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  Excise tax refund: We received a $10.1 million refund, related to fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2006, as a result of a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to excise taxes previously paid.
Deferred membership: In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date (daily convention) as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method (based on the period in which the fee was collected). This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. Prospectively, we will account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis over the specific membership term using the daily convention.
We believe it is helpful to disclose the effects of these items for purposes of providing a meaningful comparison of our current fiscal year results to prior fiscal years, as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results. The impact of each of these items noted above is presented below: Fiscal 2007 (amounts in thousands) Salesreturn reserve Employee tax consequenceson stock options Deferred Membership Excisetax refund Total Net sales $ (452,553 ) $  $   $ (452,553 ) Membership fees   (56,183 )  (56,183 ) Total revenue (452,553 )  (56,183 )  (508,736 ) Merchandise costs 358,290 (157 )  8,661 366,794 Gross margin(1) (94,263 ) (157 )  8,661 (85,759 ) SG&A  (47,115 )  300 (46,815 ) Operating income (94,263 ) (47,272 ) (56,183 ) 8,961 (188,757 ) Interest expense  (50 )   (50 ) Interest income and other (1,000 )   1,090 90 Income before income taxes (95,263 ) (47,322 ) (56,183 ) 10,051 (188,717 ) Provision for income taxes 34,942 17,358 20,608 (3,687 ) 69,221 Net Income $ (60,321 ) (29,964 ) $ (35,575 ) 6,364 $ (119,496 ) (1) Net sales less merchandise costs.
Net Sales Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net sales $ 63,087,601 $ 58,963,180 $ 51,879,070 Effect of change in estimated sales returns reserve 452,553   Net sales, as adjusted $ 63,540,154 $ 58,963,180 $ 51,879,070 Net sales increase 7.0 % 13.7 % 10.0 % Net sales increase, as adjusted 7.8 % 13.7 % 10.0 % Increase in comparable warehouse sales 6 % 8 % 7 % Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 17 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales increased $4.13 billion, or 7.0% to $63.09 billion in fiscal 2007 (a 52-week fiscal year) from $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006 (a 53-week fiscal year). The $4.13 billion increase in net sales is comprised of $2.10 billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and $2.03 billion from sales at new warehouses opened during fiscal 2007 and 2006, partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns.
Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the $4.13 billion net sales growth by approximately $356.1 million, with approximately $17.8 million of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices.
Most of the comparable sales growth derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $418.4 million, or 72 basis points.
In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of $57.9 million as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 where our reserve was increased, resulting in a decrease to net sales of $33.1 million. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007.
2006 vs. 2005 Net sales increased 13.7% to $58.96 billion in fiscal 2006, from $51.88 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily due to: 8% from comparable warehouse sales growth; 3.7% increase primarily from warehouse sales excluded from the comparable warehouse sales calculation; and 2% from an additional week in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year. Gasoline sales positively impacted comparable warehouse sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points.
Most of the comparable sales growth was derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses, while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly. Comparable sales growth was slightly offset by cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).
Changes in prices of merchandise, with the exception of gasoline, did not materially affect the sales increase. Gasoline sales contributed to the 13.7% net sales growth by approximately 235 basis points in fiscal 2006, with approximately 70% of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices.
Membership Fees Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Membership fees $ 1,312,554 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Adjustment to deferred membership balance 56,183   Membership fees, as adjusted $ 1,368,737 $ 1,188,047 $ 1,073,156 Membership fees increase 10.5 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees increase, as adjusted 15.2 % 10.7 % 11.6 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.08 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Adjusted membership fees, as a percent of adjusted net sales 2.16 % 2.02 % 2.07 % Total cardholders 50,400 47,700 45,300 18 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Membership fees increased 10.5% to $1.31 billion, or 2.08% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 from $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. Excluding the adjustment to deferred membership fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 discussed above, adjusted membership fees increased 15.2% from fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to: a five dollar increase in our annual membership fee for our U.S. and Canada Gold Star (individual), Business and Business Add-on members, which was effective May1, 2006 for new members and July1, 2006 for existing members; increased penetration of the higher-fee Executive Membership program; and additional membership sign-ups at the 30 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2007.
2006 vs. 2005 Membership fees increased 10.7% to $1.19 billion, or 2.02% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from $1.07 billion, or 2.07% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased penetration of the Executive Membership program and additional membership sign-ups at the 25 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2006.
Gross Margin Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Gross margin $ 6,637,899 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Unusual items 85,759   Gross margin, as adjusted $ 6,723,658 $ 6,217,683 $ 5,532,109 Gross margin increase 6.8 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin increase, as adjusted 8.1 % 12.4 % 9.4 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.52 % 10.55 % 10.66 % Adjusted gross margin as a percent of adjusted net sales 10.58 % 10.55 % 10.66 % 2007 vs. 2006 Gross margin was $6.64 billion in fiscal 2007 or 10.52% of net sales, compared to $6.22 billion or 10.55% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and gross margin in fiscal 2007, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.58%, or an increase of 3 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily due to a 24 basis point increase in certain merchandise departments, largely food and sundries, as well as smaller increases in certain warehouse ancillary businesses, costco.com and our international operations, offset by a decrease in our hardlines and softlines categories of approximately 15 basis points. In addition, increased penetration of the Executive Membership two-percent reward program and increased spending by Executive members negatively affected gross margin by six basis points.
In our fourth fiscal quarter, the decrease in our reserve for estimated sales returns resulted in an improvement of gross margin of approximately 2 basis points. This improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of 2007.
2006 vs. 2005 Gross margin was $6.22 billion in fiscal 2006 or 10.55% of net sales, compared to $5.53 billion or 10.66% of net sales in fiscal 2005. This eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of 19 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) the Executive Membership two-percent reward program and increased spending by executive members, which decreased gross margin by ten basis points. Additionally, a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix, with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories. These decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) $ 6,273,096 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 Unusual items (46,815 )   SG&A, as adjusted $ 6,226,281 $ 5,732,141 $ 5,061,339 SG&A a percent of net sales 9.94 % 9.72 % 9.76 % Adjusted SG&A as percent of adjusted net sales 9.80 % 9.72 % 9.76 % 2007 vs. 2006 SG&A expenses were $6.27 billion, or 9.94% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Excluding the unusual items affecting net sales and SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 9.80%, an increase of eight basis points. Of this increase, 3 basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation, and a net 5 basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs. The payroll increase was largely attributed to hourly rate increases that went into effect in March 2007 and a lower overall comparable warehouse sales increase.
2006 vs. 2005 SG&A expenses were $5.73 billion, or 9.72% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.06 billion, or 9.76% of net sales in fiscal 2005. Improved warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A by approximately nine basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll, which was positively impacted by strong comparable warehouse sales and a lower rate of increase in workers compensation costs. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation cost of approximately five basis points in fiscal 2006.
Preopening Expenses Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 Fiscal2005 Preopening expenses $ 55,163 $ 42,504 $ 53,230 Warehouse openings 30 28 21 Relocations  (3 ) (5 ) Warehouse openings, net of relocations 30 25 16 Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses, warehouse remodel projects and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening 20 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) expenses per warehouse opening can vary due to the timing of the opening relative to our fiscal year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market and the number and magnitude of warehouse remodel projects.
2007 vs. 2006 Preopening expenses totaled $55.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $42.5 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to increased warehouse remodel activity and international openings.
2006 vs. 2005 Preopening expenses totaled $42.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $53.2 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we adjusted our method of accounting for leases (entered into over the previous twenty years), primarily related to ground leases at certain owned warehouse locations that did not require rental payments during the period of construction. We recorded a cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge of $16.0 million to preopening expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Excluding this charge, preopening expenses increased year over year, due to the increase in warehouse openings.

2007 vs. 2006 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $13.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, approximately $13.0 million of this provision related to the acceleration of depreciation on ten buildings expected to be relocated in fiscal 2008.
2006 vs. 2005 The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $5.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2005.

On February20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $5.9 million, (together the 2007 Senior Notes). The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from the additional interest incurred related to the 2007 Senior Notes, offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $300 million 5.5% Senior Notes (2002 Senior Notes) in March 2007. In addition, interest expense decreased on the 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) as note holders converted approximately $61.2 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes into common stock, or $42.3 million after factoring in the related debt discount.
2006 vs. 2005 Interest expense totaled $12.6 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $34.4 million in fiscal 2005. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily included interest on the 2002 Senior Notes, the Zero Coupon Notes, and balances outstanding under our bank credit facilities and promissory notes. In fiscal 2005, interest expense also included interest on the 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the repayment of the 7 1 / 8 % Senior Notes in June 2005. In addition, interest expense decreased on the Zero Coupon Notes as note holders converted into common stock approximately $286.5 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes, or $188.9 million after factoring in the related debt discount. The amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal 2006 due to increased warehouse openings, contributing to the decrease in interest expense, as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased. The overall decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the increase in interest rates on the 2002 Senior Notes, which were swapped into variable rate debt in March 2002.
Interest Income and Other Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 Fiscal2005 Interest income $ 128,413 $ 113,712 $ 81,915 Earnings of affiliates 35,622 28,180 26,459 Minority interest and other 1,449 (3,537 ) 722 Interest Income and other $ 165,484 $ 138,355 $ 109,096 22 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2007 vs. 2006 Interest income and other totaled $165.5 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $138.4 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is largely due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments resulting from increased earnings from operations and the proceeds of the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes, as well as an increase in the earnings of affiliates, primarily our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture).
2006 vs. 2005 Interest income and other totaled $138.4 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $109.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase primarily reflects increased interest income resulting from higher interest rates earned, as well as an extra week in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.
Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 Fiscal2005 Income tax expense $ 627,219 $ 648,202 $ 485,870 Effective tax rate 36.68 % 37.01 % 31.37 % The effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 36.68%, 37.01% and 31.37%, respectively. The lower rate in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to a non-recurring $54.2million income tax benefit, primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996-2003) and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings subject to repatriation of $20.6 million. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 would have been 36.20%.
Net Income Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net income $ 1,082,772 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Unusual items (net of tax) 119,496   Net income, as adjusted $ 1,202,268 $ 1,103,215 $ 1,063,092 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.37 $ 2.30 $ 2.18 Shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share 457,641 480,341 492,035 Diluted earnings per share increase 3 % 6 % 18 % 2007 vs. 2006 Net income for fiscal 2007 was $1.08 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $1.10 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03. The unusual items previously discussed totaled $119.5 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Exclusive of these items, earnings for fiscal 2007 were $2.63 per diluted share, a 14% increase over the prior year.
23 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2006 vs. 2005 Net income for fiscal 2006 increased 3.8%, to $1.10 billion or $2.30 per diluted share, from $1.06 billion or $2.18 per diluted share, during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4million shares of common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02. The fiscal 2005 results included several non-recurring items that in the aggregate positively impacted reported earnings for all of fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.14 per share: a $54.2 million (approximately $0.11 per diluted share) income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada; a cumulative pre-tax, non-cash charge to preopening expenses of $16.0 million (approximately $0.02 per diluted share) related to a correction to our method of accounting for ground leases; and a net tax benefit with respect to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of $20.6 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share). Exclusive of these items, fiscal 2005 earnings were $2.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006s earnings per diluted share represents an increase of 13% over that figure.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table itemizes our most liquid assets (dollars in thousands): September2, 2007 September3, 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,779,733 $ 1,510,939 Short-term investments 575,787 1,322,181 Total $ 3,355,520 $ 2,833,120 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances, which were $3.36 billion and $2.83 billion at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, respectively. Of these balances, approximately $655.2 million and $593.6 million at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year-end close. The increase in our most liquid assets of $522.4 million to $3.36 billion at September2, 2007 was due primarily to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes and the cash provided by our operating activities, offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.08 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.83 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of $245.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow due to a decrease in our investment in net merchandise inventories (merchandise inventory less accounts payable) of $378.8 million, offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of $130.4 million.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $655.3 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2006, respectively, a decrease of approximately $502.2 million. The decrease in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to an increase of $169.2 million in additions to property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and remodel projects, offset by an increase in cash provided by the net reductions in short-term investments of $663.8 million.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $164.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $1.23 billion in fiscal 2006. The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of the 2007 Senior Notes in February 2007, which provided approximately $1.99 billion in 24 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) proceeds. This was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2007, which used $1.98 billion of cash, compared to $1.44 billion in fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $534.8 million and the repayment of long-term debt of $307.9 million related primarily to the 2002 Senior Notes retired in March 2007.
Dividends In April 2007, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.13 to $0.145 per share or $0.58 on an annualized basis. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled $0.55 per share. In fiscal 2006, we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share.
Contractual Obligations Our commitments at fiscal year end to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows, as of September2, 2007 (amounts in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2008 2009 to 2010 2011 to 2012 2013 and thereafter Total Contractual obligations Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 3,626,627 $ 1,357 $  $  $ 3,627,984 Long-term debt(2) 173,160 277,652 1,116,400 1,470,117 3,037,329 Operating leases(3) 137,225 242,461 209,723 1,305,035 1,894,444 Purchase obligations (equipment, services and other)(4) 350,108 40,517 1,089  391,714 Construction Commitments 329,941    329,941 Capital lease obligations and other(2) 3,990 1,937 686 5,193 11,806 Other(5) 2,168 3,936 2,546 4,928 13,578 Total $ 4,623,219 $ 567,860 $ 1,330,444 $ 2,785,273 $ 9,306,796 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders.
(2) Amounts include contractual interest payments.
(3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance and have been reduced by $149,407 to reflect sub-lease income.
(4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
(5) Consists of asset retirement and deferred compensation obligations.
Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land, building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses, plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements.
While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is managements current intention to spend approximately $1.6 billion to 25 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) $1.8 billion during fiscal 2008 for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2008 are to open approximately 38 to 42 new warehouses, inclusive of 8 to 10 relocations to larger and better-located facilities. We expect to continue our review of expansion plans in our international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets.
Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures In each of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we contributed an additional $15 million to our investment in Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which did not impact our percentage ownership of this entity, as our joint venture partner contributed a like amount. There were no such contributions in 2007.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in U.S. dollars) A wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary has a $189.8 million commercial paper program ($180.9 million at September3, 2006) supported by a $113.9 million bank credit facility that expires in March 2008 ($54.2 million at September3, 2006) with a Canadian bank, which we guarantee. At September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September2, 2007, and September3, 2006 were 5.00% and 4.65%, respectively. At September2, 2007, standby letters of credit totaling $24.1 million issued under the bank credit facility left $89.8 million available for commercial paper support. At September3, 2006, standby letters of credit totaling $20.8 million issued under the bank credit facility left $33.4 million available for commercial paper support.
Our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term $38.7 million bank line of credit ($12.8 million at September3, 2006) that expires in February 2008. At September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, $10.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were borrowed under the line of credit, and $8.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit.

Our Korean subsidiary has a short-term $12.8 million bank line of credit ($12.5 million at September3, 2006) which expires in March 2008. At September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the line of credit and $2.0 million in both years was used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006 were 6.09% and 5.48%, respectively.
Our Taiwan subsidiary has a $6.1 million bank revolving credit facility ($5.2 million at September3, 2006) and a $3.0 million bank overdraft facility, both expiring in January 2008. At September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility and $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, were 4.50% and 4.00%, respectively. A second $15.2 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in July 2008. At September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, no amounts were borrowed under the second credit facility 26 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) and $4.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, were used to support standby letters of credit. Applicable interest rates on the credit facility at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, were 4.44% and 4.00%, respectively. A third $9.1 million bank revolving credit facility is in place, which expires in March 2008. At September2, 2007 no amounts were borrowed under the third credit facility and no amounts were used to support standby letters of credit. The applicable interest rate on the credit facility at September2, 2007 was 4.57%.
Our wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary has a $80.6 million bank revolving credit facility ($113.9 million at September3, 2006) expiring in February 2010, a $70.5 million bank overdraft facility ($66.5 million at September3, 2006), renewable on a yearly basis in May 2008, and a $40.3 million uncommitted money market line entered into in February 2007 and renewable on a yearly basis beginning in May 2008. At September2, 2007, $20.1 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.23%, $15.6 million was outstanding under the uncommitted line with an applicable interest rate of 6.47% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility with an applicable interest rate of 6.75%. At September3, 2006, $38.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, with an applicable interest rate of 5.32%, and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility.
Letters of Credit We have letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit) totaling $475.0 million. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006 totaled $119.1 million and $84.9 million, respectively, including $71.7 million and $54.9 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit.
Financing Activities On February20, 2007, we issued $900 million of 5.3% Senior Notes due March15, 2012 at a discount of $2.5 million and $1.1 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes due March15, 2017 at a discount of $5.9 million (together, the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 of each year, with the first payment due on September15, 2007. The net proceeds were used, in part, to repay the 2002 Senior Notes in March 2007, and the balance has been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. The $8.4 million discount and $2.0 million issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes.
At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes.
In April 2003, our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of $34.4 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due in April 2010. In November 2002, our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due in November 2009. In July 27 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2001, our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $25.8 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due in July 2008. In October 2000, our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $30.1 million, through a private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due in October 2007 and will be refinanced. As of September2, 2007, the 1.187% and the 2.070% promissory notes are reported in the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets.
In August 1997, we completed the sale of $900.0 million principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Notes due in August2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $449.6 million. The current Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 1.5million shares of Costco Common Stock shares at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August2012. We may redeem, at our option, the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time in or after August2002. As of September2, 2007, $832.4 million in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock, of which $61.2 million and $286.5 million in principal were converted in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $42.3 million and $188.9 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, after factoring in the related debt discount.
Derivatives We have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amount, which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, was $75.0 million and $63.5 million, respectively. The mark-to-market adjustment related to these contracts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary, primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases.
Effective March25, 2002, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our 2002 Senior Notes, which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1 million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero.
We are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which we partially mitigate through the use of firm-price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of our locations in the U.S. and Canada. The effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented.
28 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements With the exception of our operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements.
Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1.00 billion and $2.00 billion of stock repurchases, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4.50 billion. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an additional $300.0 million of stock repurchases, which expires in 2010.
During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 36.4million shares at an average price of $54.39 totaling approximately $1.98 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 28.4million shares of common stock, at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1.46 billion. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately $646.4 million at September2, 2007. Purchases are made from time-to-time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired.
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self-insurance liabilities and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels.
In connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of 2007, we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, during fiscal 2007 we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452.6 million and a pretax charge to income of $94.3 million for the related gross margin and disposition costs.
We evaluate the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the 29 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales.
Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one-year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56.2 million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors.
Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year-end. At both September2, 2007 and September3, 2006 merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle.
We provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year.
Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market value.
We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. A considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 30 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change.
Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006 and we will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No.115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value 31 Table of Contents Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007. We must adopt these new requirements no later than our first quarter of fiscal 2009.
We are in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on our future consolidated financial statements.
Item7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
The nature and amount of our long and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of September2, 2007, our fixed-rate long-term debt included $67.6 million principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $47.8 million, $900.0 million of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $897.8 million, $1.10 billion of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1.09 billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $127.9 million. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt.
We hold interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity, while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds. We diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment-grade securities through a combination of internal and third-party investment management. Short-term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the majority of these instruments are of a short-term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease, there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances at September2, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $15.2 million (pre-tax) to interest income on an annual basis.
Most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies, limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates. We periodically enter into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September2, 2007 was $75.0 million.

33 Table of Contents Item9AControls and Procedures (Continued) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September2, 2007, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September2, 2007.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the 52-week period ended September2, 2006, the 53-week period ended September3, 2006, and the 52-week period ended August28, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Effective August29, 2005, the beginning of the Companys fiscal year ended September3, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R), Share-Based Payment and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September3, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated October 24, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on internal control over financial reporting.
/s/KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington October24, 2007 39 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Costco Wholesale Corporation: We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporations (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September2, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting included in Item9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September2, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the 52-week period ended September2, 2007, the 53week period ended September3, 2006, and the 52-week period ended August28, 2005, and our report dated October 24, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

44 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company). All material inter-company transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.
Costco operates membership warehouses that offer low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities. At September2, 2007, Costco operated 488 warehouses: 379 in the United States and 4 in Puerto Rico; 71 in Canada; 19 in the United Kingdom; 6 in Japan; 5 in Korea; and 4 in Taiwan. The Companys 50%-owned joint venture in Mexico operates an additional 30 warehouses.
The Companys investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. The investment in Costco Mexico is included in other assets and was $302,550 at September2, 2007 and $270,304 at September3, 2006. The equity in earnings of Costco Mexico is included in interest income and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, and for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, was $33,499, $26,646 and $24,949, respectively. The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of Costco Mexico was $193,176 and $159,677 at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, respectively. The investments and equity in earnings of other unconsolidated joint ventures are not material.
The Company, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), adjusted its beginning retained earnings for fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note 11 for additional information on the adoption SAB 108.
Fiscal Year End Costco operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August31. The fiscal year ended September2, 2007 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended September3, 2006 included 53 weeks, with the 53 rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter. The fiscal year ended August28, 2005 included 52 weeks.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions 45 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) with settlement terms of less than five days. Of the total cash and cash equivalents of $2,779,733 at September2, 2007 and $1,510,939 at September3, 2006, credit and debit card receivables were $655,205 and $593,645, respectively.
Short-term Investments In general, short-term investments have a maturity of three months to five years at the date of purchase. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at market value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis.
Receivables, net Receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates and promotional allowances, receivables from government tax authorities, reinsurance receivables held by the Companys wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. Vendor receivable balances are presented on a gross basis separate from any related payable due to that vendor. However, in certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor. Amounts are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,459 at September2, 2007 and $2,423 at September3, 2006. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and application of the specific identification method.
Vendor Rebates and Allowances Periodic payments from vendors in the form of volume rebates or other purchase discounts that are evidenced by signed agreements are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by other systematic and rational approach.
Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. At both September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle.
46 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) September2, 2007 September3, 2006 Merchandise inventories consist of: United States (primarily LIFO) $ 3,799,999 $ 3,613,412 Foreign (FIFO) 1,079,466 947,820 Total $ 4,879,465 $ 4,561,232 The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales, using estimates based on the Companys experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows: Years Buildings 5 - 50 Equipment and fixtures 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements Shorterofusefullifeor leaseterm Land improvements 15 Software acquisition and development 3 - 6 Interest costs incurred on property during the construction period are capitalized. The amount of interest costs capitalized was $11,423 in fiscal 2007, $12,681 in fiscal 2006, and $7,226 in fiscal 2005.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when management makes the decision to relocate or close a warehouse or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates whether the carrying value of the asset group is recoverable by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition with the asset groups reported net carrying value. The Company recorded a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $3,893 in fiscal 2005, reflecting its estimate of impairment relating to real property. The charge reflects the difference between the carrying value and fair value, which was based on estimated market valuations for those asset groups whose carrying value is not currently anticipated to be recoverable through future cash flows.
47 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Closing Costs Warehouse closing costs incurred relate principally to the Companys relocation of certain warehouses that were not otherwise impaired to larger and better-located facilities. The provision for fiscal 2007 included charges of $15,887 for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to accelerated depreciation on buildings to be demolished or sold and $2,279 for net gains related to the sale of real property. The fiscal 2006 provision included charges of $3,762 for warehouse closing expenses and net losses of $1,691 related to the sale of real property. The fiscal 2005 provision included charges of $11,619 for warehouse closing expenses, primarily related to lease obligations and accelerated depreciation and $881 for net losses on the sale of real property. As of September2, 2007, the Companys reserve for warehouse closing costs was $6,823 of which $6,086 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $7,041 at September3, 2006, of which $5,950 related to future lease obligations.
Goodwill Goodwill resulting from certain business combinations is included in other assets, and totaled $75,707 at September2, 2007 and $72,953 at September3, 2006. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. No impairment of goodwill has been incurred to date.
Accounts Payable The Companys banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Accordingly, included in accounts payable at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006 are $591,936 and $564,754, respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were drawn.
Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, director and officers liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. As of the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, these liabilities of $488,734 and $491,037, respectively, were included in accrued salaries and benefits, other current liabilities and accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Companys wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary participates in a reinsurance pool. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool limit any participating members individual risk. Reinsurance revenues earned of $50,897, $67,589 and $61,697 during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were primarily related to premiums received from the reinsurance pool. Reinsurance costs of $52,179, $65,760 and $65,830 during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily related to premiums paid to the reinsurance pool. Both revenues and costs are presented net in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
48 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Derivatives The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. These forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The aggregate notional amounts, which approximate the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, were $74,950 and $63,487, respectively. The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by the Companys wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary primarily to hedge U.S. dollar merchandise inventory purchases.
Effective March25, 2002, the Company entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps associated with its $300,000 5.5% Senior Notes which matured and were retired in March 2007. The swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt. As the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt, changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact. At September3, 2006, the aggregate value of the swaps was $1,243 and was included in deferred income taxes and other current assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. In March 2007, upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements, the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero.
The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing, which it partially mitigates through the use of firm-price contracts with counterparties for approximately 23% of its locations. The effects of these arrangements were not significant for any period presented.
Equity Investments in Subsidiary and Joint Ventures During 2006 and 2005, the Company contributed an additional $15,000 to its investment in Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which did not impact its percentage ownership of this entity, as the joint venture partner contributed a like amount. The Company did not contribute additional capital in 2007.
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currencies of the Companys international subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies, as well as the Companys investment in the Costco Mexico joint venture, are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income. Revenue and expenses of the Companys consolidated foreign operations are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in interest income and other and were not significant in fiscal 2007, 2006, or 2005.
Revenue Recognition The Company generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When the Company collects payments from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amounts received 49 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) are generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels.
During 2007, in connection with changes to its consumer electronic returns policy, the Company developed more detailed operational data regarding member return patterns. The data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve. Accordingly, during fiscal 2007 the Company increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of $452,553 and a pretax charge to income of $95,263 for the related gross margin and disposition costs.
The Company evaluates the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when Costco is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, can influence product or service specifications, or has several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If the Company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, it records the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales.
Amounts collected from members, which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes, are recorded on a net basis.
Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of the Companys members. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one-year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each members specific renewal date, as this methodology represented an improvement over the historical method, which was based on the period in which the fee was collected. This review resulted in a $56,183 reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. This adjustment included both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors. The adjustment for the change in method and for the correction was recorded in full in the fiscal 2007 consolidated statement of income as the Company concluded the impact to the current and historical financial statements was not material. Membership fees received from members for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $1,415,134, $1,264,929 and $1,113,948, respectively.
50 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The Companys Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. The Company accounts for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. The reduction in sales for the fiscal years ended September2, 2007,September3, 2006, and August28, 2005, and the related liability as of those dates were as follows: Fiscal2007 Fiscal2006 Fiscal2005 Two-percent reward sales reduction $ 487,877 $ 418,466 $ 319,336 Two-percent unredeemed reward liability $ 363,399 $ 299,519 $ 229,574 Merchandise Costs Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold, inbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Companys depot operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses and are reduced by vender consideration received. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation on production equipment, and other related expenses incurred by the Companys cross-docking depot facilities and in certain fresh foods and ancillary departments.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers compensation costs for warehouse employees, other than depots, fresh foods and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include utilities, bank charges and substantially all building and equipment depreciation, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.
Marketing and Promotional Expenses Costcos policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. Marketing and promotional costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative and preopening expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Preopening Expenses Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, major remodels and expansions, new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation At the beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, (SFAS 123) and all employee stock option grants made since the beginning of fiscal 2003 have been or will be 51 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) expensed ratably over the related vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options were granted (however, see Review of Stock Option Grant Practices in Note 11, for a discussion of a special committee review of historical grant practices).
The Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment (as amended) (SFAS 123R) at the beginning of fiscal 2006, which requires companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. Had compensation costs for the Companys stock-based compensation been determined for awards made prior to fiscal 2003 under SFAS 123R, the Companys net income and net income per share would have been adjusted to the proforma amounts indicated below: Fiscal2005 Net income, as reported $ 1,063,092 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 43,344 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value-based methods for all awards, net of related tax effects (63,012 ) Proforma net income $ 1,043,424 Net Income per share: Basicas reported $ 2.24 Basicpro-forma $ 2.20 Dilutedas reported $ 2.18 Dilutedpro-forma $ 2.12 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Short-term investments designated as hold-to-maturity securities are recorded at cost which approximated market value at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006. The fair value of fixed rate debt at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006 was $2,249,977 and $574,426, respectively. The carrying value of fixed rate debt at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006 was $2,167,883 and $523,892, respectively.

Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.
Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that its tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that are not probable of being sustained. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. To the extent that the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.
Net Income per Common Share The computation of basic net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to stock options and restricted stock units and the if converted method for the convertible note securities.
Stock Repurchase Programs Share repurchases are not displayed separately as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of stockholders equity in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act, which requires retirement of repurchased shares. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. See Note 5 for additional information.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, account- 53 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) ing in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, and the Company will adopt these new requirements as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The estimated cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2008 is not expected to be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company must adopt these new requirements no later than its first quarter of fiscal 2009.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to FASB No.115 (SFAS 159). Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007. The Company must adopt these new requirements no later than its first quarter of fiscal 2009.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 will have on its future consolidated financial statements.

Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on the price indices, and some of the leases provide for rents based on the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Contingent rents have not been material. The Company accounts for its leases with step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease.
Aggregate rental expense for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $143,448, $134,406 and $127,770, respectively. The amount for 2005 excludes $15,999 in rent expense associated with the correction made in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to the Companys method of accounting for ground leases that did not require rental payments during the period of construction.
The Company has sub-leases related to certain of its operating lease agreements. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized sub-lease income of $9,008, $9,425 and $7,773, respectively, included in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of income.

In fiscal 2006, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.49 per share. The Companys current quarterly dividend rate is $0.145 per share or $0.58 per share on an annualized basis.
Payment of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Factors considered in determining the size of the dividends are profitability and expected capital needs of the Company. The Company presently expects to continue to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.
Stock Repurchase Programs In January and July of 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved additional stock repurchases of $1,000,000 and $2,000,000, respectively, which expire in 2009, bringing total authorizations since inception of the program in fiscal 2001 to $4,500,000. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2007, the Board of Directors approved an additional $300,000 for stock repurchases, which expires in 2010.
During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 36,390,000 shares at an average price of $54.39, totaling approximately $1,979,170, including commissions. During fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 28,407,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $51.44, totaling approximately $1,461,217, including commissions. Purchases are made from time-to-time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases, or pursuant to share repurchase plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired.
These amounts differ from the stock repurchase balances in the statements of cash flows due to repurchases that are accrued at year-end. As of September2, 2007, under current Board authorizations, the Company had $646,364 available for additional share repurchases.
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes net income, plus certain other items that are recorded directly to stockholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the Companys consolidated balance sheets consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, were as follows: September2, 2007 September3, 2006 Unrealized losses on short-term investments $ (815 ) $ (4,849 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment and other 371,404 282,112 Accumulated other comprehensive income $ 370,589 $ 277,263 Note 6Stock-Based Compensation Plans Through the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company granted stock options under the Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (Second Restated 2002 Plan) and predecessor plans, and since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company has granted restricted stock units (RSUs) under the Second Restated 2002 Plan. Stock options generally vest over five years and have a ten-year term. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs.
In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123 at the beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company changed its method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense from the graded-vesting method to the straight-line method. Under the graded-vesting method, an award is accounted for as multiple awards, based on the number of vesting tranches, each tranche with a different requisite service period. The effect of graded-vesting attribution is to recognize more compensation expense in the early years of the overall vesting period. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted prior to fiscal 2003 will continue to be recognized using the graded-vesting method, while compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted subsequent to fiscal 2002 is being recognized using the straight-line method. SFAS 123R requires the estimation of the number of stock-based awards that will 62 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 6Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued) ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), and requires that the compensation expense recognized equals or exceeds the number of stock-based awards vested. While options and RSUs generally vest over five years with an equal amount vesting on each anniversary of the grant date, the Companys plans allow for daily vesting of the pro-rata number of stock-based awards that would vest on the next anniversary of the grant date in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. As such, the Company does not reduce stock-based compensation for an estimate of forfeitures because this would result in less compensation expense recognized than the number of stock-based awards vested. The impact of actual forfeitures arising in the event of involuntary termination is recognized as actual forfeitures occur.
Summary of Stock Option Activity The following table summarizes stock option transactions during fiscal 2007: Shares (in000s) Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value(1) Outstanding at September3, 2006 39,868 $ 37.57 Granted   Exercised (9,511 ) 34.17 Forfeited or expired (269 ) 40.80 Outstanding at September2, 2007 30,088 39.26 5.37 $ 676,594 Exercisable at September2, 2007 19,283 $ 38.35 4.43 $ 451,196 (1) The difference between the exercise price and market value at September2, 2007.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 Expected volatility 28 % 38 % Expected term 5.2years 6.6years Risk free interest rate 4.33 % 4.28 % Expected dividend yield 0.99 % 1.11 % Weighted-average fair value per option granted $ 13.87 $ 18.01 In fiscal 2006, the expected volatility was based primarily on the historical volatility of the Companys stock and, to a lesser extent, the six-month implied volatility of its traded options. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, expected stock price volatility was estimated using only historical volatility. In fiscal 2006, the expected term was the average of the life of all historical grants that have been exercised and the term at which the historical average intrinsic gain is reached. Prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, the expected term was calculated as the average term between grant and exercise dates for those 63 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 6Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued) options where at least 40% of the original grant was exercised. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with an equivalent remaining term. The expected dividend yield is based on the annual dividend rate at the time of the grant.
The following is a summary of stock options outstanding as of September2, 2007 (number of options in thousands): Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Prices Number Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Number Weighted- Average Exercise Price $9.00$34.28 6,482 4.49 $ 32.01 4,894 $ 31.66 $34.74$37.35 7,755 5.04 36.91 5,101 36.67 $37.44$43.00 5,295 3.91 40.53 5,222 40.57 $43.79$43.79 7,493 7.58 43.79 2,341 43.79 $44.97$52.50 3,063 5.17 47.33 1,725 48.21 30,088 5.37 $ 39.26 19,283 $ 38.35 At September3, 2006 and August28, 2005, there were 22,289 and 25,987 options exercisable at weighted average exercise prices of $35.92 and $33.66, respectively.
Tax benefits and intrinsic value related to total stock options exercised during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 are provided in the following table: 2007 2006 2005 Actual tax benefit realized for stock options exercised $ 65,778 $ 80,417 $ 50,298 Intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 212,678 $ 240,211 $ 145,223 Employee Tax Consequences on Certain Stock Options As previously disclosed, in fiscal 2006, the Company initiated an internal review of its historical stock option grant practices to determine whether the stated grant dates of options were supported by the Companys books and records. As a result of this preliminary review, a special committee of independent directors was formed. In connection with this review, and guidance issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on November30, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a program intended to protect approximately 1,000 Company employees who are United States taxpayers from certain adverse tax consequences resulting from their options having been granted originally at prices lower than the market value. The program involved increasing the exercise prices on certain stock options granted from 2000 to 2003 and, in turn, the Company making payments to employees in an amount approximately equal to the increase in the exercise price.
As a result of this program, the Company made cash payments totaling $18,735 to approximately 1,000 employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which resulted in a pre-tax stock compensation charge of $8,072 (incremental fair value). The difference between the cash payment and the incremental fair value of $10,663 was recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital, as it represented a partial cash settlement of the original award because no future service was required to earn the cash payment.
64 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 6Stock-Based Compensation Plans (Continued) While the Company is still examining the availability of similar alternatives for employees outside the United States, the Company recorded $37,923 in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in fiscal 2007 for the estimated charge to remedy adverse tax consequences related to stock options held and previously exercised by employees outside the United States. This amount primarily relates to options exercised from 2003 through the end fiscal 2007, and represents the estimated payment the Company would make to compensate employees for expected disallowance of the deduction previously allowed for gains on options exercised that were previously deemed to have been granted at fair market value.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity RSUs are granted to employees and non-employee directors, which generally vest over five years and three years respectively; however, the Company provides for accelerated vesting upon qualified retirement for recipients that have attained certain years of service with the Company. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested shares. Accordingly, the fair value of RSUs is the quoted market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period. At September2, 2007, 7.1million RSUs were available to be granted to eligible employees, directors and consultants under the Second Restated 2002 Plan.
The following awards were outstanding as of September2, 2007:  4,496,500 shares of time-based RSUs in which the restrictions lapse upon the achievement of continued employment over a specified period of time; and  282,500 performance RSUs, of which 205,000 were approved in fiscal 2007 and will formally be granted to certain executive officers of the Company upon the achievement of specified performance targets. Once formally granted, the restrictions lapse upon achievement of continued employment over a specified period of time.

The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options at September2, 2007, was $139,880, and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 2.2 years.
Note 7Retirement Plans The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan that is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90 days of employment. For all U.S. employees, with the exception of California union employees, the plan allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first one thousand dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual contribution based on salary and years of service.
California union employees participate in a defined benefit plan sponsored by their union. The Company makes contributions based upon its union agreement. For all the California union employees, the Company sponsored 401(k) plan currently allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first five hundred dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each eligible participant a contribution based on hours worked and years of service.
The Company has a defined contribution plan for Canadian and United Kingdom employees and contributes a percentage of each employees salary. The Company complies with government requirements related to retirement benefits for other international operations and accrues expenses based on a percentage of each employees salary as appropriate.
Amounts expensed under all plans were $238,826, $233,595 and $191,651 for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company has defined contribution 401(k) and retirement plans only, and thus has no liability for post-retirement benefit obligations.

The effective income tax rate on earnings was 36.68% in fiscal 2007, 37.01% in fiscal 2006 and 31.37% in fiscal 2005. The lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to a $54,155 income tax benefit resulting from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the United States and Canada (covering the years 1996-2003) and a net tax benefit on unremitted foreign earnings of $20,592. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $30,602, resulting from excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings, and recognized a tax expense of $10,010, resulting from tax expense on translation gains accumulated to the date that the Company determined that certain unremitted foreign earnings were no longer permanently reinvested. The net benefit of $20,592 related to that portion of unremitted foreign earnings that the Company planned to repatriate in the foreseeable future. Excluding these benefits the effective income tax rate on earnings in fiscal 2005 was 36.2%. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company distributed $119,588 and $427,296, respectively, from its Canadian operations.
The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. affiliates, including its 50% owned investment in the Mexico corporate joint venture, aggregating $1,046,747 and $907,090 at September2, 2007 and September3, 2006, respectively, as such earnings are deemed permanently reinvested. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits and complexity of the computation, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability or benefit associated with such earnings if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested.

These equity instruments are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect. All outstanding RSUs are dilutive for all fiscal years presented and thus are included in the table above.
Note 10Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company is a defendant in the following matters, among others: Two cases purportedly brought as class actions on behalf of certain present and former Costco managers in California, in which plaintiffs principally allege that they have not been properly compensated for overtime work. Scott M. Williams v. Costco Wholesale Corp., United States District Court (San Diego), Case No.02-CV-2003 NAJ (JFS); Greg Randall v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC-296369. The Randall matter is currently in the final stages of class certification briefing. Williams has been stayed pending the class certification outcome in Randall.
An overtime compensation case certified as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs principally allege that Costcos semi-annual bonus formula is improper with regard to retroactive overtime pay. Anthony Marin v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Superior Court for the County of Alameda, Case No. RG-04150447. Costco has filed an appeal challenging the entry of a $5.3 million judgment in favor of the class.
A case brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs principally allege that Costco did not properly compensate and record hours worked by 69 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 10Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) employees and failed to provide meal and rest breaks. Kevin Doty and Sarah Doty v. Costco Wholesale Corp., United States District Court (Los Angeles), Case No. CV-05-3241 FMC (JWJ). On May14, 2007, the Court granted final approval to a $7.5 million classwide settlement. Settlement distribution via a third-party administrator is ongoing.
A case purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which the plaintiff principally alleges that Costcos routine closing procedures and security checks cause employees to incur delays that qualify as uncompensated working time and that effectively deny them statutorily guaranteed meal periods and rest breaks. Elizabeth Alvarado v. Costco Wholesale Corp., United States District Court (San Francisco), Case No. C-06-04015-MJJ. Discovery is ongoing in this case. A class certification hearing is set for December18, 2007.
Claims in these five actions are made under various provisions of the California Labor Code and the California Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek restitution/disgorgement, compensatory damages, various statutory penalties, punitive damages, interest, and attorneys fees.
A case brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and California state law. Shirley Rae Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., United States District Court (San Francisco), Case No. C-04-3341-MHP. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, interest and attorneys fees. Class certification was granted on January11, 2007. On May11, 2007, the United States Court of Appeal for Ninth Circuit granted a petition to hear Costcos appeal of the certification. On May30, 2007, the District Court ordered a stay during the pendency of the appeal.
Class actions stated to have been brought on behalf of certain present and former Costco members. In Barmak v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et al., No. BC348857 (Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles), it is asserted that the Company violated various provisions of the common law and California statutes in connection with its former practice of paying Executive Members who downgraded or terminated their memberships a 2% Reward for less than twelve months of eligible purchases. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, restitution, injunctive relief, attorneys fees and costs, prejudgment interest, and punitive damages. The Court denied the Companys motion to dismiss the complaint in which the Company had asked that the challenged practice, while it was still in effect, was appropriately disclosed to Executive Members. On August31, 2007, the Court certified a nationwide class in respect of the breach of contract claim and a California class for the remaining claims.
In Evans, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. BC351869 (commenced in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles and removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and Dupler v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Index No.06-007555 (commenced in the Supreme Court of Nassau County, New York and removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York), it is asserted that the Company violated various provisions of California and New York common law and statutes in connection with a membership renewal practice. Under that practice, members who pay their renewal fees late generally have their twelve-month membership renewal periods commence at the time of the prior years expiration rather than the time of the late payment. Plaintiffs in these two actions seek compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement, preliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneys fees and costs, prejudgment interest and, in Evans, punitive damages. Briefing is ongoing concerning plaintiffs motion for class certification in Dupler.

Mimi Serna,Timothy Herrock,et al. v.Costco Wholesale Corp., Case No.2:07-CV-1491-AHM (JWJx). This is a consumer class action filed in March 2007 in the United States District Court for theCentral DistrictofCaliforniaalleging willful violations of the 15 U.S.C.  1681c(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Section1681c(g), enacted December4, 2003, provides that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last five digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction. Plaintiffs allege that, on or after January1, 2005, Costco printed the expiration date and/or more than the last five digits of their credit card or debit card number on electronically printed receipts provided at the point of sale involving transactions at Costcos gasoline dispensers throughout the United States. The lawsuitseeks statutory damages, punitive damages, andattorneysfees. Briefing is under way concerning plaintiffs motion for class certification.
On October4, 2006, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, seeking records relating to the Companys receipt and handling of hazardous merchandise returned by Costco members and other records. The Company is cooperating with the United States Attorneys Office and at this time cannot reasonably estimate any loss that may arise from this matter.
71 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 10Commitments and Contingencies (Continued) On March15, 2007, the Company was informed by the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Western District of Washington that the office is conducting an investigation of the Companys past stock option granting practices to determine whether there have been any violations of federal law. As part of this investigation, the U.S. Attorneys Office has served a grand jury subpoena on the Company seeking documents and information relating to its stock option grants. The Company is cooperating with the inquiry and at this time cannot reasonably estimate any loss that may arise from this matter.
Except where indicated otherwise above, a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time for the matters described. The Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter.
Note 11Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 In September 2006, the SEC released SAB 108. The transition provisions of SAB 108 permitted the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect in retained earnings of immaterial errors relating to prior years. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the SEC to be amended. In accordance with SAB 108, the Company adjusted beginning retained earnings for fiscal 2006 for the items described below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior periods.
Review of Stock Option Grant Practices Following publicity regarding the granting of stock options, the Company initiated an internal review of its historical stock option grant practices to determine whether the stated grant dates of options were supported by the Companys books and records. As a result of this preliminary review, a special committee of independent directors was formed. The Company filed a Form 8-K dated October12, 2006, which provided details regarding the special committees review. The special committee engaged independent counsel and forensics experts, and comprehensively reviewed all equity grants made during the years 1996 through 2005. In late September 2006, the special committee reported its conclusions and recommendations to the board of directors, which, after further review, adopted these conclusions and recommendations. The review identified no evidence of fraud, falsification of records, concealment of actions or documentation, or intentional deviation from generally accepted accounting principles. The review indicated that, in several instances, it was impossible to determine with precision the appropriate measurement date for specific grants. For these grants it was feasible only to identify a range of dates that included the appropriate measurement dates, where some dates in the range were after the recorded grant date.
The subject grants were made to over one thousand of the Companys employees, including, among others, the Companys warehouse managers and buyers. None of the options in which the review identified imprecision in the grant process were issued to the Companys chief executive officer, chairman, or non-employee directors, except in April 1997 both the chief executive officer and the chairman received, as part of a broad grant to hundreds of employees, one grant subject to imprecision that may have benefited each by up to approximately $200. Other grants subject to imprecision were made to a director who serves as executive vice president and chief financial officer and to a director who had no 72 Table of Contents COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Continued) Note 11Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 (Continued) role in the determination of any grant date, but who serves as senior executive vice president and chief operating officer.
Given the lack of historical documentation, it was not possible to precisely determine the amount of the adjustments that should be made. Based on the recommendation of the special committee, which was based on the documentation that was available, the Company, as of the end of fiscal 2006, recorded an adjustment to transfer $116,157 from retained earnings to paid-in capital, representing previously unrecorded after-tax compensation expense, and to increase the deferred tax asset account by $31,480. In those cases where the committee was unable to identify the likely grant date of the options, the latest date on which the decision could have been made was used. The Company also recorded $1,701 for the estimated federal income tax consequences stemming from the probable disallowance of compensation deductions claimed related to the subject option grants. The Company informed the SEC of the special committees investigation and conclusions. A grand jury investigation concerning the review is ongoing. See Note 10 for additional information.
The special committee and management do not believe that the net effects of this adjustment were material, either quantitatively or qualitatively, in any of the years covered by the review. In reaching that determination, the following quantitative measures were considered: Year Netaftertax effectof adjustment Reported net income(1) Percentof reportednet income 2005 $ 3,954 $ 1,063,092 0.37 % 2004 6,430 882,393 0.73 % 2003 9,092 721,000 1.26 % 2002 14,872 699,983 2.12 % 1996-2001 81,809 2,769,678 2.95 % Total $ 116,157 $ 6,136,146 1.89 % (1) Excludes cumulative effect of accounting change related to membership fees of $118,023 (net of tax) reported in fiscal 1999.
Accounting for Reinsurance Agreements The Company adjusted its beginning retained earnings for fiscal 2006 related to a correction in the historical accounting treatment of certain finite risk arrangements. Because of the limited amount of risk transfer included in the agreements, historical premium payments should have been accounted for as a deposit asset rather than expensed over the policy term.
Deferred Tax Liability Adjustment The Company also adjusted its beginning retained earnings for fiscal 2006 for a historical misstatement in deferred taxes related to unreconciled differences in the detailed records supporting the deferred tax liability for depreciation of property and equipment. These differences had accumulated over a period of several years. This resulted in an overstatement of the tax basis and a corresponding understatement of the Companys net deferred tax liability.
