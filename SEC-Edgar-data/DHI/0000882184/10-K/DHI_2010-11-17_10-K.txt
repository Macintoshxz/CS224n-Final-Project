(the Company) is a national homebuilder. As such, we construct and sell single-family homes in metropolitan areas of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West regions of the United States. We offer high quality homes, designed principally for first-time and move-up home buyers. Our homes generally range in size from 1,000 to 5,000square feet and range in price from $80,000 to $900,000. For the year ended September30, 2001, we closed 21,371 homes with an average sales price approximating $200,700.
We are one of the largest and most geographically diversified homebuilders in the United States, with operating divisions in 20states and 38markets as of September30, 2001. The markets we operate in include: Albuquerque, Atlanta, Austin, Birmingham, Charleston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbia, Dallas, Denver, FortMyers/ Naples, FortWorth, Greensboro, Greenville, Hilton Head, Houston, Jacksonville, Killeen, LasVegas, LosAngeles, Louisville, Maryland-D.C., Miami/ West Palm Beach, Minneapolis/ St.Paul, Myrtle Beach, NewJersey, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh/ Durham, Richmond, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, SanAntonio, SanDiego, Tucson, Virginia-D.C. and Williamsburg.
We build homes under the following names: D.R.Horton, Arappco, Cambridge, Continental, Dietz Crane, Dobson, Emerald, Mareli, Milburn, Regency, SGS, Torrey and Trimark.
Our financial reporting segments consist of homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding operations comprise the most substantial part of our business, with more than 98% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001. The homebuilding operations segment generates the majority of its revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots. The financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance and closing services. Financial information, including revenue, pre-tax income and identifiable assets of both of our reporting segments are included in the consolidated financial statements.
We were incorporated in Delaware on July1, 1991, to acquire all of the assets and businesses of 25predecessor companies, which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by Donald R. Horton.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1901Ascension Blvd., Suite100, Arlington, Texas 76006, our telephone number is (817)856-8200, and our Internet website address is www.drhorton.com.
1 Table of Contents Operating Strategy We believe that the following operating strategies have enabled us to achieve consistent growth and profitability: Geographic Diversity From 1978 to late 1987, excluding locations acquired in our 1998 merger with Continental Homes, our homebuilding activities were conducted in the Dallas/ FortWorth area. We then instituted a policy of diversifying geographically, entering the following of our current markets, both through startup operations and acquisitions, in the years shown: Years Entered Markets 1987 Phoenix 1988 Atlanta, Orlando 1989 Charlotte 1990 Houston 1991 Maryland-D.C., Virginia-D.C.
1992 Chicago, Raleigh/Durham 1993 Austin, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, 	SanDiego 1994 Minneapolis/St. Paul, Las Vegas, SanAntonio 1995 Birmingham, Denver, Greensboro, Miami/West Palm 	Beach 1996 Albuquerque 1997 Greenville, New Jersey, Tucson 1998 Charleston, Hilton Head, Jacksonville, Killeen, 	Louisville, Myrtle Beach, Portland, Richmond, Sacramento, 	Williamsburg 1999 Columbia 2001 FortMyers/Naples We continually monitor the sales and margins achieved in each of the subdivisions in which we operate as part of our evaluation of the use of our capital. While we believe there are significant growth opportunities in our existing markets, we also intend to continue our policy of diversification by seeking to enter new markets. We believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential. Typically, we will not invest material amounts in real estate, including raw land, developed lots, models and speculative homes, or overhead in start-up operations in new markets, until such markets demonstrate significant growth potential and acceptance of our products.
Acquisitions As an integral component of our operational strategy of continued expansion, we continually evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions. We believe that expanding our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies affords us several benefits not found in start-up operations. Such benefits include:  Established land positions and inventories;  Existing relationships with land owners, 	developers, subcontractors and suppliers;  Brand name recognition;and  Proven product acceptance by home buyers in the 	market.
In evaluating potential acquisition candidates, we seek homebuilding companies that have an excellent reputation, a track record of profitability and a strong management team with an entrepreneurial orientation.
2 Table of Contents We limit the risks associated with acquiring a going concern by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have an immediate positive impact on our earnings. During the last eight fiscal years, we have made 16 acquisitions, including the assets of Fortress-Florida, Inc. (Fortress) and Emerald Builders (Emerald) in May and July, 2001, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2000, Fortress, which operates in the Jacksonville, Florida market, closed 711 homes, generating revenues of approximately $99million. For the year ended December31, 2000, Emerald, with operations primarily in Houston, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona, closed 1,394 homes, generating revenues of approximately $236million. In October, 2001, we signed a definitive agreement under which Schuler Homes (NASDAQ:SHLR) will merge into D.R.Horton, Inc., through a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $1.2billion, including the assumption of debt. We will continue to evaluate potential future acquisition opportunities that satisfy our acquisition criteria in both existing and new markets.
Decentralized Operations We decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more operating flexibility to our local division presidents. We have 45separate operating divisions, some of which are in the same market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president, an office manager and staff, a sales manager and sales personnel, and a construction manager and construction superintendents. We believe that division presidents, who are intimately familiar with local conditions, make better decisions regarding local operations. Our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted operating levels in their operating divisions.
Operating Division Responsibilities Each operating division is responsible for:  Site selection, which involves  A feasibility study;  Soil and environmental reviews;  Review of existing zoning and other governmental 	requirements;and  Review of the need for and extent of offsite work 	required to meet local building codes.
Negotiating lot option or similar contracts;  Overseeing land development;  Planning its homebuilding schedule;  Selecting building plans and architectural 	schemes;  Obtaining all necessary building 	approvals;and  Developing a marketing plan.
Corporate Office Controls The corporate office controls key risk elements through centralized:  Financing;  Cash management;  Risk management;  Accounting and management reporting;  Payment of subcontractors invoices; 3 Table of Contents  Administration of payroll and employee benefits;  Final approval of land and lot acquisitions;  Capital allocation;and  Oversight of inventory levels.
Cost Management We control our overhead costs by centralized administrative and accounting functions and by limiting the number of field administrative personnel and middle level management positions. We also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities, publications and newsletters sponsored by local real estate brokers, mortgage companies, utility companies and trade associations.
We control construction costs through the efficient design of our homes and by obtaining favorable pricing from certain subcontractors and national vendors based on the high volume of services and products they provide us. We also control construction costs by monitoring expenses on each house through our purchase order system. We control capital and overhead costs by monitoring our inventory levels through our management information systems.
Markets We conduct homebuilding activities in five geographic regions, consisting of: Geographic Region Markets Mid-Atlantic Charleston, Charlotte, Columbia, Greensboro, 	Greenville, Hilton Head, Maryland-D.C., Myrtle Beach, New 	Jersey, Raleigh/Durham, Richmond, Virginia-D.C., Williamsburg Midwest Chicago, Louisville, Minneapolis/St. Paul Southeast Atlanta, Birmingham, FortMyers/Naples, 	Jacksonville, Miami/West Palm Beach, Orlando Southwest Albuquerque, Austin, Dallas, FortWorth, 	Houston, Killeen, Phoenix, SanAntonio, Tucson West Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Portland, 	Sacramento, Salt Lake City, SanDiego When entering new markets or conducting operations in existing markets, among the things we considerare:  Regional economic conditions;  Job growth;  Land availability;  Local land development process;  Consumer tastes;  Competition;and  Secondary home sales activity.
4 Table of Contents Our homebuilding revenues by geographic region are: Year Ended September30, 1999 2000 2001 (In millions) Mid-Atlantic $ 540.6 $ 614.5 $ 615.6 Midwest 347.1 451.0 457.6 Southeast 429.6 491.5 518.2 Southwest 1,068.0 1,176.7 1,489.5 West 733.7 870.5 1,302.7 Total $ 3,119.0 $ 3,604.2 $ 4,383.6 Land Policies Typically, we acquire land and enter into lot option contracts to acquire developed building lots only after necessary entitlements have been obtained, i.e., when we have the right to begin development or construction. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we will, among other things, complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies and other engineering work, and determine that all necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction have been acquired. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our own homebuilding activities, occasionally we sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders.
We also use lot option contracts, in which we purchase the right, but not the obligation, to buy building lots at predetermined prices on a takedown schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings. Lot option contracts generally are on a nonrecourse basis, thereby limiting our financial exposure to earnest money deposits given to property sellers. This enables us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development. At September30, 2001, about 46% of our total lot position of 115,655 lots was under option contracts.
A summary of our land/lot position at September30, 2001 is: Finished lots we own 15,831 Lots under development we own 46,263 Total lots owned 62,094 Lots available under lot option and similar 	contracts 53,561 Total land/lot positions 115,655 We limit our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:  Generally commencing construction of homes under 	contract only after receipt of a satisfactory down payment and, 	where applicable, the buyers receipt of mortgage approval;  Limiting the number of speculative homes (homes 	started without an executed sales contract) built in each 	subdivision;  Closely monitoring local market and demographic 	trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, 	such as new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and 	personal income trends;  Utilizing lot option contracts, where 	possible;and  Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to 	smaller tracts of land.
5 Table of Contents Construction Our home designs are prepared by architects in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of the community. We also offer optional interior and exterior features to enhance the basic home design and to promote our sales efforts.
Substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors. Our construction supervisors monitor the construction of each home, participate in material design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, subject the work of subcontractors to quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. Subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at a fixed price. Agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each subdivision. We compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate.
Construction time for our homes depends on the weather, availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home, and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a home within four months.
We do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in process materials for homes under construction. Typically, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancellable at our option with a 30day notice. In recent years, we have not experienced any significant delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor.
Marketing and Sales We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision. At September30, 2001, we owned 942 model homes, which we generally do not offer for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective home buyers by providing them with floor plans, price information, tours of model homes and the selection of options and other custom features. We train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising plans.
In addition to using model homes, we typically build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision to enhance our marketing and sales activities. Construction of these speculative homes also is necessary to satisfy the requirements of relocated personnel and independent brokers, who often represent home buyers requiring a completed home within 60days. We sell a majority of these speculative homes while they are under construction or immediately following completion. The number of speculative homes is influenced by local market factors, such as new employment opportunities, significant job relocations, growing housing demand and the length of time we have built in the market. Depending upon the seasonality of each market, we attempt to limit our speculative homes in each subdivision. At September30, 2001, we averaged less than five speculative homes, in various stages of construction, in each subdivision.
We advertise on a limited basis in newspapers and in real estate broker, mortgage company and utility publications, brochures, newsletters and on billboards. In addition, we use our Internet web site to market the location, price range, and availability of our homes. To minimize advertising costs, we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns. We also believe that model homes play a significant role in our marketing efforts. Consequently, we expend significant effort in creating an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.
Our sales contracts require a down payment of at least $500. The contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates within a specified period, typically four to six weeks, and may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. We include a home sale in our sales backlog when the sales contract is signed and we have received the initial down payment. We do not recognize revenue upon the sale of a home until it is closed and title passes to the home buyer. The average period between the signing of a sales contract for a home and closing is approximately three to five months.
6 Table of Contents Customer Service and Quality Control Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing, quality control inspections and responding to customers post-closing needs. We believe that prompt and courteous response to home buyers needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service, and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and home buyers. We provide our home buyers with a limited one-year warranty on workmanship and building materials. The subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In most cases, we supplement our one-year warranty by purchasing a ten-year limited warranty from a third party. To cover our potential warranty obligations, we accrue an estimated amount for future warranty costs.
Customer Financing We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell. CHMortgage, a wholly-owned subsidiary, provides mortgage banking services in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North and South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. DRHMortgage, LLC, a joint venture formed in 1998 with a third party, presently provides services in California. On a combined basis, our mortgage banking entities provided mortgage financing services for about 61% of the homes closed during the year ended September30, 2001, in the markets served, compared to 51% during the year ended September30, 2000. We anticipate expanding these mortgage activities to other markets in which we conduct homebuilding operations.
In other markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing, we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to home buyers a range of conventional mortgage financing programs. By making information about these programs available to prospective home buyers and maintaining a relationship with such mortgage lenders, we are able to coordinate and expedite the entire sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place on a timely and efficient basis.
Title Services Through our subsidiaries, Century Title, Custom Title, DRH Title Company of Texas, Ltd., DRH Title Company of Florida, Inc., DRH Title Company of Minnesota, Inc., Metro Title Company, Principal Title and Travis County Title Company, we serve as a title insurance agent by providing title insurance policies and closing services to purchasers of homes we build in the Austin, Dallas, FortWorth, Houston, Maryland-D.C., Miami/ West Palm Beach, Minneapolis, Orlando, Phoenix, SanAntonio and Virginia-D.C. markets. We assume no underwriting risk associated with these title policies.
Employees At September30, 2001, we employed 4,342persons, of whom 1,095 were sales and marketing personnel, 1,382 were executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 1,326 were involved in construction, and 539 worked in mortgage and title operations. The Company had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.
Competition The single family residential housing industry is highly competitive and we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders, often with larger subdivisions designed, planned and developed by such homebuilders. Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design, mortgage financing terms and location.
7 Table of Contents Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters The housing, mortgage and title insurance industries are subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and our subcontractors must comply with various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including zoning, density and development requirements, building, environmental, advertising and consumer credit rules and regulations, as well as other rules and regulations in connection with our development, homebuilding, sales and financial services activities. These include requirements affecting the development process, as well as building materials to be used, building designs and minimum elevation of properties. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the FHA and VA are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. This can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding.
We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties. These environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas.
Our internal mortgage activities and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws, consumer credit rules and regulations and other rules and regulations unique to such activities. Additionally, mortgage loans and title activities originated under the FHA, VA, FNMA and GNMA are subject to rules and regulations imposed by those agencies.
ITEM2.PROPERTIES We own a 52,000square foot office complex, consisting of three single-story buildings of steel and brick construction, located in Arlington, Texas, that serves as the principal executive offices and houses one of the Dallas/ FortWorth divisions. We also own a 37,000square foot one-story building in Atlanta, Georgia; a 22,864square foot building in Lakeville, Minnesota; two buildings in Englewood, Colorado totaling 28,217square feet; and a 16,000square foot building in The Woodlands, Texas, that serve as division offices for some of our operating divisions. We lease approximately 438,000square feet of space for our other operating divisions under leases expiring between November 2001 and March 2011.
ITEM3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business. Such matters, if decided adversely to us, would not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition.
ITEM4.SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS None.

We have declared quarterly cash dividends of four cents per share for fiscal 2000 and five cents per share for fiscal 2001.
The declaration of cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our general financial condition and general business conditions. We are required to comply with certain covenants contained in the bank agreements and Senior Note and Senior Subordinated Note indentures. The most restrictive of these requirements allows us to pay cash dividends on common stock in an amount, on a cumulative basis, not to exceed 50% of consolidated net income, as defined, subject to certain other adjustments. Pursuant to the most restrictive of these requirements, we had approximately $392.5million available for the payment of dividends and the acquisition of our common stock at September30, 2001.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED D.R.Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) provide homebuilding services in 20states and 38markets through its 45homebuilding divisions. Through its financial services operations, the Company also provides mortgage banking and title agency services in many of these same markets.
Year Ended September30, 2001 Compared 	to Year Ended September30, 2000 Consolidated revenues increased 21.9%, to $4,455.5million in 2001 from $3,653.7million in 2000, primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues. The increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to $103.0million in revenues generated by Fortress-Florida, acquired in May 2001, and Emerald Builders, acquired in July 2001.
Income before income taxes increased 31.9%, to $407.8million in 2001 from $309.2million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, income before income taxes increased 0.7percentage points, to 9.2%, from 8.5% in 2000, primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage achieved by the homebuilding segment, which was offset in part by write-downs to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of the Companys investments in start-up and emerging growth companies and the decline in the fair value of the Companys interest rate swap agreements during theyear.
The consolidated provision for income taxes increased 30.1%, to $152.9million in 2001, from $117.5million in 2000, due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate decreased 0.5percentage points, to 37.5% in 2001, from 38.0% in 2000, primarily due to changes in the overall effective state income taxrate.

Revenues from home sales increased in four of the 12 Table of Contents Companys five market regions, with percentage increases ranging from 0.8% in the Midwest region to 53.4% in the West region. Home sales revenues declined 0.7% in the Mid-Atlantic region. The increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of the Companys markets, and an increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well as the increases attributable to the acquisition of Fortress-Florida in May 2001 and Emerald Builders in July 2001. In markets where the Company operated throughout both twelve-month periods, home sales revenues increased by 19.9%, to $4,188.7million (20,748homes closed) in 2001 from $3,494.9million (19,138homes closed) in2000.
The average selling price of homes closed during 2001 was $200,700, up 9.9% from $182,600 in 2000. The increase in average selling price was due to changes in the mix of homes closed and, with the strong housing demand, the Companys ability to sell more custom features with its homes and to raise prices in some of its markets.
The value of new net sales contracts increased 22.5%, to $4,502.6million (22,179homes) in 2001 from $3,676.4million (19,223homes) in 2000. The value of new net sales contracts increased in all of the Companys five market regions, with percentage increases ranging from 2.4% in the Mid-Atlantic to 45.7% in the West. The overall increase in the value of new net sales contracts was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of the Companys markets, as well as sales achieved by Fortress-Florida, acquired in May 2001, and Emerald Builders, acquired in July 2001. In markets where the Company operated throughout both fiscal years, the value of new net sales contracts increased 19.5%, to $4,391.0million, and the number of new net sales contracts increased 12.0%, to 21,518 homes. The average price of a new net sales contract in 2001 was $203,000, up 6.1% over the $191,300 average in 2000. The increase in average selling price was due to changes in the mix of homes sold and, with the strong housing demand, the Companys ability to sell more custom features with its homes and to raise prices in some of its markets.
At September30, 2001, the Companys backlog of sales contracts was $1,933.8million (9,263homes), up 25.8% from $1,536.9million (7,388homes) at September30, 2000. In markets where the Company operated at the end of both fiscal years, the Companys backlog of sales contracts increased 14.4%, to $1,758.1 (8,229homes). The average sales price of homes in backlog was $208,800 at September30, 2001, up 0.4% from the $208,000 average at September30, 2000.
Cost of sales increased by 19.9%, to $3,527.1million in 2001 from $2,941.1million in 2000. The increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues. Cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues declined 1.0percentage point, to 80.4% in 2001, from 81.4% in 2000, as the Company continued to benefit from increased prices, savings achieved in its national purchasing program and lower material costs. Total homebuilding cost of sales was 80.4% of total homebuilding revenue, down 1.2percentage points from 81.6% in2000.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 19.9%, to $432.0million in 2001 from $360.4million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased to 9.9% in 2001 from 10.0% in 2000, primarily as a result of a 0.2percentage point decline in salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenues.
Interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to $8.8million in 2001 from $10.2million in 2000. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, homebuilding interest expense decreased to 0.2% in 2001 from 0.3% in 2000. Throughout 2001, inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interest-bearing debt. Therefore, a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 2000. The Company follows a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development. During both periods, the Company expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory. Capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time of home closings.
Other expense associated with homebuilding activities was $34.7million in 2001, as compared to $2.1million of other income in 2000. The expense in 2001 is primarily due to a $22.9million write-down to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of the Companys investments in start-up and emerging growth companies and a $13.8million decline in the fair value of the Companys interest rate swap agreements.
13 Table of Contents Year Ended September30, 2000 Compared 	to Year Ended September30, 1999 Revenues from home sales increased 14.4%, to $3,496.1million (19,144homes closed) in 2000 from $3,055.0million (18,395homes closed) in 1999. Revenues from home sales increased in all of the Companys market regions, with percentage increases ranging from 8.5% in the Southeast region to 28.7% in the Midwest region.

The average selling price of homes closed during 2000 was $182,600, up 9.9% from $166,100 in 1999. The increase in average selling price was due to changes in the mix of homes closed and, with the strong housing demand, the Companys ability to sell more custom features with its homes and to raise prices to cover increased costs.
The value of new net sales contracts increased 12.6%, to $3,676.4million (19,223homes) in 2000 from $3,266.2million (18,911homes) in 1999.

Cost of sales increased by 15.4%, to $2,941.1million in 2000 from $2,548.5million in 1999. The increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues. Cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues declined 0.2percentage points, to 81.4% in 2000 from 81.6% in 1999, as higher costs were more than offset by increased prices and savings achieved in our national purchasing program. Cost of land/lot sales decreased to 87.6% of land/lot sales revenues in 2000, from 88.2% in 1999. Total homebuilding cost of sales was 81.6% of total homebuilding revenue, down 0.1percentage point from 81.7% in1999.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 16.4%, to $360.4million in 2000 from $309.6million in 1999. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses increased to 10.0% in 2000 from 9.9% in1999.

Throughout 2000, inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interest-bearing debt. Therefore, a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 1999. The Company follows a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development. During both periods, we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory. Capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time of home closings.

These activities are being expanded to additional markets served by the homebuilding segment. General and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 33.6%, to $47.4million in 2001 from $35.5million in 2000. As a percentage of financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased by 5.7percentage points to 65.9% in 2001 from 71.6% in 2000, primarily from efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues generated in markets entered in2000.
Year Ended September30, 2000 Compared 	to Year Ended September30, 1999 Revenues from the financial services segment increased 32.9% to $49.5million in 2000 from $37.3million in 1999.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At September30, 2001, the Company had available cash and cash equivalents of $239.3million. Inventories (including finished homes, construction in progress, and developed residential lots and other land) at September30, 2001, had increased by $613.3million from September30, 2000, due to a general increase in business activity, the acquisitions of Fortress-Florida and Emerald Homes and the expansion of operations in the Companys market areas.

Each $1,000 note was sold for $524.78, providing a yield-to-maturity of 3.25%per year. The notes are convertible into the Companys common stock at any time, if the sale price of the common stock exceeds specified thresholds or in other specified instances, at the rate of approximately 17.5shares per $1,000 face amount at maturity. The conversion ratio equates to an initial conversion price of $30.00per share.

The Company examines the carrying value of its excess cost over net assets acquired (goodwill)and other intangible assets as current events and circumstances warrant to determine whether there are any impairment losses. If indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. No event has been identified that would indicate an impairment of the value of goodwill recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
On October23, 2001, the Company announced that it has signed a definitive agreement under which Schuler Homes, Inc. would merge into D. R. Horton, Inc. through a cash and stock transaction valued at 16 Table of Contents approximately $1.2billion, including the assumption of debt. At September30, 2001, Schuler had consolidated assets, primarily inventories, of approximately $1.2billion. On a pro-forma basis combining Schuler with Western Pacific, in the twelve-month period ended September30, 2001, Schuler closed 5,254homes, generating revenues of approximately $1.5billion. This merger is expected to close in January or February 2002, pending approval by the shareholders of both companies. After the merger is completed, the holders of Schulers public debt, under change of control covenants thereof, will have the right to require the Company to redeem such debt at 101% of par, plus accrued interest. At September30, 2001, Schulers public debt amounted to $499million. The Company expects to finance the cash portion of the consideration, including any required redemptions of public debt, with existing cash resources and credit facilities. The Companys assumption of Schulers public debt will have the additional effect of reducing the amount the Company has available for the payment of cash dividends and other restricted payments.
At September30, 2001, the financial services segment had mortgage loans held for sale of $222.8million and loan commitments for $143.8million at fixed rates.

The warehouse facility is not guaranteed by the parent company. As of September30, 2001, $182.6million had been drawn under this facility. All mortgage company activities are financed under the warehouse facility. The warehouse facility contains financial covenants relating to minimum net worth and maximum leverage with which the mortgage company is in compliance.
The Companys rapid growth and acquisition strategy require significant amounts of cash. It is anticipated that future home construction, lot and land purchases and acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds and existing and future credit facilities. At September30, 2001, under the currently effective shelf registration statements, the Company has approximately 8.0million shares issuable to effect, in whole or in part, possible future acquisitions and the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to $350million. In the future, the Company intends to continue to maintain effective shelf registration statements that will facilitate access to the capital markets.
During fiscal 2001, the Companys Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.04per common share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.05per common share, the last of which was paid on August22, 2001 to stockholders of record on August8, 2001.

In 1999 and 2000, the Company entered into three separate limited partnership agreements with the purpose of investing in start-up and emerging growth companies whose technology and business plans have the potential of permitting the Company to leverage its size, expertise and customer base in the homebuilding industry. The Company originally authorized investment of up to $125million in such companies over a four-year period. In January 2001, the original $125million authorization was reduced to the $31.3million that had been invested in such companies as of that date. The investments are concentrated in e-commerce businesses that serve the homebuilding, real estate and financial service industries, as well as in businesses whose strategic focus allows for the diversification of the Companys operations. As of September30, 2001, the carrying value of the Companys investments in such companies, reported in homebuilding other assets, amounted to $10.2million.
Except for the Schuler merger, ordinary expenditures for the construction of homes, the acquisition of land and lots for development and sale of homes, at September30, 2001, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures.
17 Table of Contents INFLATION The Company and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases the Companys financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. The Company attempts to pass through to its customers any increases in its costs through increased sales prices and, to date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on the Companys future results of operations.
SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements made by Company officials to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about the Company, may be construed as forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any or all of the forward-looking statements included in this report and in any other reports or public statements of the Company may turn out to be inaccurate due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forward-looking statements. The following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us. Other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us.
General Economic, Real Estate and Other 	Conditions The homebuilding 	industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in 	general and local economic conditions, such as employment 	levels, availability of financing for home buyers, interest 	rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. Any oversupply of 	alternatives to new homes, such as rental properties and used 	homes, could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on 	the sale of new homes. Homebuilders are also subject to risks 	related to the availability and cost of land suitable for 	homebuilding, the availability and cost of materials and labor, 	adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in 	construction schedules and cost overruns.
Increases in Interest Rates or Decreases in 	Mortgage Availability Virtually 	all of our customers finance their homes through lenders 	providing mortgage financing. Any future increases in interest 	rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing 	could depress the market for new homes by making our homes less 	affordable.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental 	Matters We are subject to 	extensive and complex regulations that affect the development 	and homebuilding process, including zoning, density and building 	standards. Such regulations often provide broad discretion to 	the administering governmental authorities. This can delay or 	increase the costs of development or homebuilding. Laws and 	regulations relating to the protection of the environment can 	cause delays, increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or 	restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in 	environmentally sensitive areas.
Substantial 	Debt We have a significant amount 	of debt. The amount of our debt could limit our ability to 	obtain future financing for working capital, capital 	expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other 	requirements. It could also limit our flexibility in planning 	for, or reacting to, changes in our business and make us more 	vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in 	general economic conditions.
Competitive 	Conditions The homebuilding 	industry is very competitive. In each of the markets we serve, 	we compete with other homebuilders for home buyers, desirable 	properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. 	Competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result 	in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices, 	the need for increased selling incentives, lower sales or delays 	in construction.
18 Table of Contents  Availability of 	Capital Our ability to grow our 	business and operations profitably is substantially dependent 	upon our ability to obtain capital from the sale of equity or 	debt or additional bank borrowings. Increases in interest rates, 	changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating 	agencies, concerns by potential investors about the market or 	the economy, changing lending objectives of financial 	institutions, or further consolidation of financial institutions 	that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs 	of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for 	us to achieve our strategic growth objectives. Moreover, the 	indentures for our outstanding debt contain provisions that may 	restrict the debt we may incur in the future.
Growth 	Strategies Since 1993, we have 	acquired and successfully integrated many homebuilding 	companies. In the future, we may acquire additional companies. 	Our prospects may be affected by our ability to successfully 	identify and integrate future acquisitions. Our prospects may 	also be affected by our ability to implement successfully our 	growth strategies in the markets we currently serve.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms10-K, 10-Q and 8-K should be consulted.
19 Table of Contents ITEM7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term debt. The Company monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates and utilizes both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument, but not the Companys earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect the Companys future earnings and cash flows. The Company has mitigated its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. The Company generally does not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on the Companys fixed-rate debt until such time as the Company is required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.
The Companys interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133 when it was adopted on October1, 2000. Since their maturities and other terms did not match the related debt, they were determined to be ineffective hedges (as defined by the Statement). Therefore, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps, since any such changes must be reflected in the Companys income statements.
The Companys financial services segment is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan production activities. Mortgage loans are funded at fixed interest rates before they are committed to specific investors and interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. Forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities are designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the overall fair value of funded loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedge is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the year ended September30, 2001, was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. The IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments with gains and losses recorded in current earnings. Interest rate risk associated with IRLCs is managed through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments, forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities and the purchase of options on financial instruments. These instruments are considered non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair market value with gains and losses recorded in current earnings. At September30, 2001, total forward commitments to mitigate interest rate risk related to funded loans and IRLCs were approximately $160.5million, the duration of which was less than six months.
The following table sets forth, as of September30, 2001, the Companys long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value. In addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value of the Companys interest rate swaps.

Horton, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September30, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries at September30, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business: D.R.Horton, Inc. (the Company) is a national builder that is engaged primarily in the construction and sale of single-family housing in 38markets and 20states in the United States. The Company designs, builds and sells single-family houses on lots developed by the Company and on finished lots which it purchases, ready for home construction. Periodically, the Company sells lots it has developed. The Company also provides title agency and mortgage brokerage services to its homebuyers. The Company does not retain or service the mortgages that it originates but, rather, sells the mortgages and related servicing rights to investors.
Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Accounting principles: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Cash: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Amounts in transit from title companies for home closings are included incash.
Cost of sales: Cost of sales includes home warranty costs, purchased discounts for customer financing, and sales commissions paid to third parties.
Excess of cost over net assets acquired: For business acquisitions consummated prior to July1, 2001, the excess of amounts paid over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated benefit period, ranging from ten to twenty years. The Company plans to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on October1, 2001, the first day of fiscal 2002. At that time, the consolidated goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to periodic review for impairment.
Additional consideration paid in subsequent periods under the terms of purchase agreements is included as acquisition costs. Amortization expense was $9,481,000, $8,193,000 and $9,567,000 in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $29,309,000 and $38,876,000 at September30, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Potential impairments of intangible assets are reviewed annually or when events and circumstances warrant an earlier review. Impairments are determined to exist when estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with an intangible asset are less than the assets carrying value.
Interest: The Company capitalizes interest during development and construction. Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the home buyer. Interest costs are (inthousands): Year Ended September30, 1999 2000 2001 Capitalized interest, beginning of year $ 35,153 $ 41,525 $ 66,092 Interest incurred homebuilding 76,543 104,360 131,028 Interest expensed Directly homebuilding (12,018 ) (10,227 ) (8,809 ) Amortized to cost of sales (58,153 ) (69,566 ) (91,401 ) Capitalized interest, end of year $ 41,525 $ 66,092 $ 96,910 27 Table of Contents D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories: Finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value less costs to sell. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated costs, unless such costs would not be recovered from the cash flows generated by future disposition. In this instance, such inventories are measured at fair value, less costs of disposal.
Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis as cost of sales. Included in inventories are related interest and property taxes which are capitalized in inventory during the development and construction periods. Residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when building permits are requested. Land and development costs are allocated to individual lots on a pro-rata basis.
Minority interests: The Company has joint venture arrangements on two land projects whereby the Company is entitled to a percentage of the profits and/or losses and is the managing partner. The financial position and results of operations of the joint venture are consolidated for financial statement purposes and the partners equity positions are disclosed as minority interests.
Property and equipment: Property and equipment, including model home furniture, is stated on the basis of cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation generally is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Accumulated depreciation was $38,285,000 and $54,038,000 as of September30, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Revenue recognition: Revenue is recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property transfer to the buyer.
Advertising cost: The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $22,182,000, $24,043,000, and $28,900,000 in fiscal 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively.
Earnings per share: Basic net income per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year.
Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities outstanding.
The following table sets forth the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (inthousands): Year Ended September30, 1999 2000 2001 Numerator: Net income $ 159,827 $ 191,719 $ 257,009 Denominator: Denominator for basic earnings per share 	weighted-average shares 75,954 75,068 75,677 Effect of dilutive securities: 67/8%convertible subordinated notes 398   Employee stock options 1,027 654 1,276 Denominator for diluted earnings per share 	adjusted weighted average shares and assumed conversions 77,379 75,722 76,953 In September 2000, the Board of Directors declared a 9% common stock dividend, payable on September29, 2000, to stockholders of record on September18, 2000. In February 2001, the Board of Directors declared an 11% common stock dividend , payable on March23, 2001 to stockholders of record on 28 Table of Contents D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) March9, 2001. The dividends were accounted for based on the fair value of the Companys stock on the date of declaration. The average share amounts presented above for 1999 and 2000 have been restated to reflect the effects of the stock dividends.
Options to purchase 1,425,000shares of common stock at various prices were outstanding during fiscal 2000 but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, their effect would be antidilutive. All options outstanding during 2001 were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Segment information: Effective September30, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS131 establishes new standards for segment reporting which is based on the way management organizes segments within a company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
The Companys financial reporting segments consist of homebuilding and financial services. The Companys homebuilding operations comprise the most substantial part of its business, with more than 98% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001. The homebuilding operations segment generates the majority of its revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots. The financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services. Expenditures for long-lived assets and depreciation and amortization related to the financial services segment for the years ended September30, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were not significant.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are described throughout this note. Assets, revenues and operating income of the Companys reportable segments are included in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income.
Long-lived assets: Potential impairments of long-lived assets are reviewed annually or when events and circumstances warrant an earlier review. In accordance with SFAS No.121, impairment is determined when estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the assets carrying value.
Stock-based compensation: The Company may, with the approval of its Board of Directors, grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions as specified by the SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Impact of recently issued accounting standards: Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued in June 1998, and was later amended by SFAS137 and 138, which were issued in June 1999 and June 2000, respectively. Pursuant to the implementation requirements of SFAS No.133, the Company adopted it on October1, 2000, the first day of the Companys fiscal year ending September30, 2001. The Companys interest rate swaps, the terms of which are more fully described in Note B, were not designated as hedges under the provisions of SFAS No.133. The Statement requires such swaps to be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Changes in their fair value must be recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Accordingly, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle amounting to $2.1million, net of income taxes of $1.3million, as an adjustment to net income in 2001. The fair value of the Companys interest rate swaps is recorded in homebuilding other assets, and the change in their fair value is recorded in other expense. The impact of adoption of SFAS No.133 relating to hedging activities for mortgage loans and loan commitments was not material.
29 Table of Contents D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to periodic tests for impairment of recorded values.
In accordance with the terms of SFAS No.142 that permit its early adoption, the Company plans to apply the new rules for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning October1, 2001. Application of the provision prohibiting the amortization of goodwill is expected to result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately $9.0million in the fiscal year ended September30, 2002. During the year, the Company will perform the required tests for impairment of goodwill. The Company does not believe that such tests will have a significant, adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position.
Mortgage loans: Mortgage loans held for sale are reported net of discounts and are stated at fair value as determined in the aggregate, based on sale commitments or current market quotes. Any gain or loss on the sale of loans is recognized at the time of sale. Loan origination fees, net of the related direct origination costs, are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the related mortgage loans held for sale and are recognized in income upon the sale of the mortgage loans.
The Company enters into forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities when loans are funded but not yet committed to a specific investor and designates the derivative instruments as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the overall fair value of the loans. Accordingly, changes in the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings, as is the change in value of the loans. During the fiscal year ended September30, 2001, the Companys net gain related to the ineffective portion of its fair value hedging instruments was not material. The net gain is included in Financial Services Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Loan commitments: To meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) which are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. In accordance with SFAS No.133 and related Derivatives Implementation Group conclusions, the Company classifies and accounts for IRLCs as non-designated derivative instruments with gains and losses recorded to current earnings. At September30, 2000 and 2001, the Companys IRLCs totaled $75.6million and $143.8million, respectively.
The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments, forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments. These instruments are considered nondesignated derivatives and are accounted for at fair market value with gains and losses recorded to current earnings. As of September30, 2001, the Company had approximately $160.5million of forward commitments outstanding which were subject to interest rate risk.

The Company has $350million remaining on its currently effective universal shelf registration statement.
Homebuilding: The Company has an $825million unsecured revolving bank credit facility, consisting of a $775million four-year revolving loan and a $50million four-year letter of credit facility that matures in April 2002. Additionally, the Company has another $45million standby letter of credit agreement maturing in 2003. The Company is currently in negotiations to refinance the four-year revolving loan and letter of credit facilities. Borrowings bear daily interest at rates based upon federal funds or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon the Companys ratio of debt to tangible net worth. In addition to the stated interest rates, the revolving credit facility requires the Company to pay certain fees. Under the debt covenants associated with the revolving credit facility, at September30, 2001, the Company had additional borrowing capacity of $746.8million. The average interest rates of the unsecured bank debt at September30, 2000 and 2001 were 7.4% and 3.3%, respectively.
In August 2001, the Company issued $200million principal amount of 77/8%Senior Notes.

The notes are convertible into the Companys common stock at any time, if the sale price of the common stock exceeds specified thresholds or in other specified instances, at 31 Table of Contents D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) the rate of approximately 17.5shares per $1,000 face amount at maturity.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) any time on or after April15, 2001 at redemption prices decreasing from 105%. The annual effective interest rate of the notes, after giving effect to the amortization of deferred financing costs and discount, is10.2%.
All series of Senior Notes are senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Company, and senior to all existing and future indebtedness expressly subordinated to them. The Senior Subordinated Notes rank behind all existing and future Senior Notes and bank credit facilities. Both the Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed by the majority of the Companys subsidiaries. Upon a change of control of the Company, holders of all series of the notes have the right to require the Company to redeem such notes at a price of 101% of the par amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest.
The indentures of the bank credit facilities and the Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes contain covenants which, taken together, limit investments in inventory, stock repurchases, cash dividends and other restricted payments, incurrence of indebtedness, asset dispositions and creation of liens, and require certain levels of tangible net worth. At September30, 2001, these covenants limit the additional debt the Company could incur to $746.8million. Additionally, cash dividends paid on the Companys common stock and other restricted payments are limited to an amount not to exceed, on a cumulative basis, 50% of consolidated net income, as defined, subject to certain other adjustments. Pursuant to the most restrictive of these requirements, the Company had approximately $392.5million available for the payment of dividends and other restricted payments at September30, 2001.
The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to help manage a portion of its interest rate exposure. The agreements convert a notional amount of $200million from a variable rate to a fixed rate. These agreements are cancellable by a third party during periods where LIBOR exceeds 7%. The agreements expire at dates through September, 2008. The Company does not expect non-performance by the counter-party, a major U.S.bank, and any losses incurred in the event of non-performance are not expected to be material. Net payments or receipts under these agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest incurred. As a result of these agreements, the Companys net interest costs were reduced by $3.6million and $1.5million in fiscal 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Maturities of consolidated notes payable, assuming the revolving bank facility is not extended, are $234.6million in 2002, $15.3million in 2003, $152.8million in 2004, $201.1million in 2005, $148.5million in 2006 and $1,317.9million thereafter.

These notes payable enable the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, CHMortgage CompanyI, Ltd. to perform its loan origination and warehousing functions. The interest rates of the mortgage warehouse line payable at September30, 2000 and 2001 were 7.6% and 3.6%, respectively.

The Company matches portions of employees voluntary contributions. Additional employer contributions in the form of profit sharing are at the discretion of the Company. Expenses for these Plans were $2,272,000, $3,124,000 and $4,204,000 for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
The Companys Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs) are non-qualified deferred compensation programs that provide benefits payable to certain management employees upon retirement, death, or termination of employment with the Company. Under one SERP, the Company accrues an unfunded benefit based on a percentage of the eligible employees salaries, as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined formula. The Company recorded $833,000, $972,000 and $1,265,000 of expense for this plan in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Effective January15, 1999, the Company adopted the D.R. Horton, Inc. 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company at a discounted price of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase. Under the terms of the plan, the total fair market value of the common stock that an eligible employee may purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15% of the employees annual compensation or $25,000. Under the plan, employees of the Company purchased 34,750shares for $380,000 in 2000 and 7,450shares for $125,000 in 2001.
The Company Stock Incentive Plans provide for the granting of stock options to certain key employees of the Company to purchase shares of common stock. Options are granted at exercise prices which approximate the market value of the Companys common stock at the date of the grant. Options generally expire 10years after the dates on which they were granted. Options vest over periods of 4 to 10years. There were 1,104,591 and 1,611,012shares available for future grants under the Plans at September30, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Company issued a 9% stock dividend on September18, 2000, and an 11% stock dividend on March9, 2001. The net effects of the dividends were to increase options outstanding by 345,664shares in September 2000 and 493,210 in March 2001.

The exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, and therefore no compensation expense is recognized for the initial grants. SFAS No.123 requires disclosure of pro forma income and pro forma income per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for option awards granted in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001. Management believes the fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 pro forma amounts may not be representative of the effects of option awards on future pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share because options granted before 1996 are not considered in these calculations. Application of the fair value method, as specified by SFAS123, would decrease net income by $1,648,000 ($0.02per diluted share), $1,909,000 ($0.03per diluted share) and $2,300,624 ($0.03per diluted share) in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
The weighted average fair value of grants made in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $8.85, $7.14 and $7.78, respectively.
The fair values of the options granted were estimated on the date of their grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions: 1999 2000 2001 Risk free interest rate 5.78 % 6.00 % 5.83 % Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 Expected volatility 49.50 % 48.80 % 49.50 % Expected dividend yield .70 % 1.10 % 1.26 % NOTEGFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair values of the Companys financial instruments are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are estimated. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve matters of judgment and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Estimated fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used.

For the senior and senior subordinated notes, fair values represent quoted market prices on the exchange on which the securities are traded. For interest rate swaps, mortgage loans held for sale, loan commitments and forward contracts, the fair values are estimated based on quoted market prices for similar financial instruments.
NOTE H COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that, while the ultimate outcome of the contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into option agreements to purchase land and developed lots. At September30, 2001, cash deposits of approximately $41.8million and promissory notes approximating $1.7million secured the Companys performance under these agreements.
Additionally, in the normal course of its business activities, the Company provides standby letters of credit and performance bonds, issued by third parties, to secure performance under various contracts. At September30, 2001, outstanding standby letters of credit were $74.9million and performance bonds were $416.2million. The Company has an additional capacity of $21.3million for standby letters of credit under its revolving credit facility.

(Encore), a Company affiliate which, together with other Company affiliates, invested in technology start-up and emerging growth companies. During the term of EVPs interest in Encore, such director advised and assisted the Company in its homebuilder acquisitions. In connection with the termination of the Companys investment program through Encore, the existing agreement with EVP was terminated, along with EVPs interests in Encore. Since such termination, through advisory arrangements with the Company, such director has continued to monitor Encore and affiliate investments and to advise and assist the Company in its homebuilder acquisitions, and the Company has paid fees to EVP. Under these advisory arrangements, such director has also been active in the process of integrating acquired homebuilding operations. For the years ended September30, 2000 and 2001, the Company paid EVP approximately $677,000 and $1,724,000, respectively, excluding reimbursement of expenses, under the foregoing agreements and arrangements. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2002, the Company has agreed to pay EVP at a quarterly rate of $500,000, in addition to the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with such directors continued advice and assistance.
