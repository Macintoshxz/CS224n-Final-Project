All statements, trend analysis and other information contained below relating to markets,  our products and trends in revenue, as well as other statements  including  words such as  "anticipate",  "believe"  or "expect"  and statements   in  the  future  tense  are   forward-looking   statements.   These forward-looking  statements  are subject to business  and  economic  risks,  and actual events or our actual future  results could differ  materially  from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties. We will not necessarily update this information if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate.  Risks and  uncertainties  that may affect our future results and performance  include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 37 to 43.   ITEM 1:  BUSINESS   Overview           Electronic  Arts was initially  incorporated  in California in 1982. In September 1991, we were reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. Our principal executive  offices are  located at 209 Redwood  Shores  Parkway,  Redwood  City, California 94065 and our telephone number is (650) 628-1500.  We operate in two principal business segments globally:   o       EA Core  business  segment:  creation,  marketing and  distribution  of          entertainment software.   o       EA.com  business  segment:  creation,  marketing  and  distribution  of          entertainment  software  which can be played  or sold  online,  ongoing          management of subscriptions of online games and website advertising.           EA Core           We create, market and distribute interactive entertainment software for a  variety  of  hardware  platforms.  As of March 31,  2001,  our  business  was comprised of the following:   o       Distribution  of over 100 titles  that we  developed  and/or  published          under one of our brand names in North America,  including  older titles          marketed as "Classics".   o       Distribution  of localized  versions of our products in the rest of the          world.   o       Distribution  of  approximately  20 additional  titles that were either          developed by other software  publishers (that we refer to as Affiliated          Labels) in North America or titles we have assisted in the  development          of with other software publishers (referred to as Co-Published titles).   o       Distribution of over 4,000 Affiliated Label and Co-Published  titles in          the rest of the world.       Since our inception,  we have developed and are developing  products for 41 different hardware platforms, including the following:   o       IBM(R)PC and compatibles   o       32-bit Sony PlayStation(R)   o       32-bit Nintendo Game Boy Advance   o       64-bit Nintendo(R)64   o       128-bit Sony PlayStation 2   o       128-bit Microsoft Xbox(TM)   o       128-bit Nintendo GameCube(TM)        Our product  development methods and organization are modeled on those used in the  entertainment  industry.  We also market our  products  with  techniques borrowed from other entertainment  companies such as record producers,  magazine publishers and video distributors.  Employees whom we call "producers",  who are responsible  for  the  development  of one or  more  products,  oversee  product development  and  direct  teams  comprised  of both our  employees  and  outside contractors.  Our designers regularly work with celebrities and organizations in sports,  entertainment  and other areas to develop  products that provide gaming experiences  that are as realistic and interactive as possible.  Celebrities and organizations  with whom we have contracts include:  FIFA, NASCAR,  John                                         3 Madden,  the National  Basketball  Association,  the PGA TOUR,  Tiger Woods, the National Hockey League,  Football  Association  Premier League,  Formula One and Warner Bros.  We maintain  development  studios in  California,  Canada,  United Kingdom, Florida, Texas, Japan, Washington, Maryland, Australia and Nevada.           We  invest  in the  creation  of  state-of-the-art  software  tools and utilities that are then used in product development.  These tools allow for more cost-effective  product  development and the ability to more efficiently convert products from one hardware platform to another. We have also made investments in facilities and equipment to facilitate the creation and editing of digital forms of video and audio recordings and product  development  efforts for new hardware platforms.           We distribute our products and those of our Affiliated Labels primarily by direct sales to retail chains and outlets in the United States and Europe. In Japan and the Asia Pacific  region,  we  distribute  products  both  directly to retailers  and through third party  distributors.  Our products are available in over 80,000 retail locations worldwide. In fiscal 2001, approximately 37% of our net revenues  were  generated by  international  operations,  compared to 40% in fiscal 2000 and 42% in fiscal 1999.           EA.com           On March 22, 2000, the  stockholders  of Electronic Arts authorized the issuance of a new series of common  stock,  designated  as Class B common  stock ("Tracking Stock"). The Tracking Stock is intended to reflect the performance of Electronic Arts' online and e-Commerce division  ("EA.com").  As a result of the approval of the Tracking Stock Proposal,  Electronic Arts' existing common stock has been  re-classified as Class A common stock ("Class A Stock") and that stock reflects the performance of Electronic Arts' other businesses ("EA Core").              EA.com, a division of Electronic Arts,  represents  Electronic Arts' online and  e-Commerce  business.  EA.com  develops,  publishes and  distributes online  interactive  games.  EA.com's  business includes  subscription  revenues collected for Internet game play on our websites, website advertising,  sales of packaged goods for Internet-only  based games and sales of Electronic Arts games sold  through the EA.com web store.  Electronic  Arts began  development  of its initial  online  product,  Ultima  Online,  during  fiscal year 1996. We shipped Ultima  Online  during  fiscal year 1998,  and began  development  of our online business during the same year.  EA.com's  websites  include  EA.com,  individual marketing  sites for Electronic  Arts' games or studios and the Games Channel on America Online,  which launched in the second half of calendar 2000. Our goal is to be the leading online games site. To date,  the majority of our  subscription revenues have been generated by Ultima Online, Ultima Online: The Second Age and Ultima Renaissance (collectively referred to as Ultima Online) and our Worldplay and  Kesmai  games.  In  addition,  all  of  our  packaged  goods  revenues  for online-only  games have been  generated  by Ultima  Online.  The  packaged  good product  is  sold  through  our  traditional  distribution  channel  to  various retailers.  The Ultima Online  product is then sold by the retail channel to the end customer who must sign up for EA.com's  online  service to enjoy online play on a month-to-month  subscription  basis. We also began  generating  advertising revenues in October 2000 as a result of  launching  the EA.com site on the world wide web and the AOL Games Channel.   Investments and Joint Ventures           Acquisitions           Pogo Corporation           On February 28, 2001, we acquired Pogo  Corporation (now referred to as "Pogo") for $43,333,000,  including an initial investment of $42,000,000 and the redemption of Pogo  preferred  stock of  $1,333,000.  The  acquisition  has been accounted for under the purchase  method.  Pogo operates an  ad-supported  games service that reaches a broad consumer market. Pogo's internet-based family games focus on easy-to-play  card, board and puzzle games. The Company has contributed Pogo  to  EA.com.  See  note  14 of  the  Notes  to the  Consolidated  Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.           Kesmai Corporation           On February 7, 2000, we acquired Kesmai Corporation (now referred to as "Kesmai")  from  News  America   Corporation   ("News  Corp")  in  exchange  for $22,500,000  in cash  and  approximately  206,000  shares  of  Electronic  Arts' existing  Class A  common  stock  valued  at  $8,650,000.  The  transaction  was accounted  for under the purchase  method.  Kesmai(TM)  is managed by EA.com and specializes  in the  design  and  development  of  multiplayer  games  delivered directly to consumers  over the Internet and is a major provider of game content to the Games  Channel on the AOL service.  The Company  granted 5 percent of the initial equity (Class B Stock)  attributable  to EA.com to News Corp in exchange for  the  206,000   shares  noted  above,   adjusting  the  total  common  stock consideration relating to the acquisition by $703,000 to $9,353,000. The Company has contributed  Kesmai to EA.com.  See note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.                                         4 Westwood Studios           In September  1998, we completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios, Inc.  and  certain  assets  of  the  Irvine,   California-based  Virgin  Studios (collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including transaction  expenses.  The  transaction  was  accounted  for under the purchase method.  Westwood is best known for its  successful PC  franchises,  Command and Conquer  and  Lands  of  Lore.  See  note 14 of the  Notes  to the  Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.            Other Business Combinations           Additionally,  during fiscal 2000, we acquired two software development companies.  See  note 14 of the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements, included in item 8 hereof.           Joint Ventures           In May 1998, Electronic Arts and Square Co., Ltd. ("Square"), a leading developer  and  publisher  of  entertainment  software in Japan,  completed  the formation  of two new joint  ventures,  in North  America  and  Japan.  In North America,  the companies formed Square  Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which has  exclusive  publishing  rights  in  North  America  for  future  interactive entertainment  PlayStation  titles  created  by  Square.  We own a 30%  minority interest in this joint venture while Square owns 70%. Additionally,  we have the exclusive right to distribute in North America products  published by this joint venture.           In Japan,  the  companies  established  Electronic  Arts Square KK ("EA Square KK"),  which  localizes and publishes in Japan our properties  originally created in North America and Europe, as well as develops and publishes  original video games in Japan. We own a 70% majority interest, while Square owns 30%. See note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item 8 hereof.           Investments           We have made  investments as part of our overall strategy and currently hold minority equity interests in several  companies.  As of March 31, 2001, our minority equity investments include  investments in NovaLogic,  Inc. and Firaxis Software, Inc.   Market           Historically,  no hardware  platform or video game system has  achieved long-term dominance in the interactive  entertainment  market. In addition,  the installed  base of  multimedia-enabled  home  computers,  including  those  with Internet  accessibility,  has  continued  to grow as personal  computer,  or PC, prices have  declined  and the quality  and choices of software  have  increased dramatically.  We develop and publish products for multiple platforms,  and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy.           The  following  table  details  select  information  on a sample of the hardware platforms for which we have published titles: ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ -------------                                                 Video Game Console /    Date Introduced                  Medium/            Manufacturer                                Platform Name   in North America             Product Base    Technology ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ------------- Sega                                      Genesis               1989                Cartridge        16-bit                Nintendo                                Super NES(TM)               1991                Cartridge        16-bit              Matsushita           3DO(TM)Interactive Multiplayer(TM)               1993             Compact Disk        32-bit                    Sega                                       Saturn               1995             Compact Disk        32-bit                    Sony                                  PlayStation               1995             Compact Disk        32-bit                Nintendo                                  Nintendo 64               1996                Cartridge        64-bit                    Sony                                PlayStation 2               2000   Digital Versatile Disk       128-bit ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ------------- Sony           Sony  released  the  PlayStation  2 console in Japan in March 2000,  in North  America in October 2000 and in Europe in November  2000.  Compared to the initial  forecast for  PlayStation 2 hardware  shipments from Sony,  there was a significant  shortage of  PlayStation 2 hardware  units during the year in North America and Europe. According to Sony, this was due to component shortages which limited  the number of units  that  could be  manufactured.  The  PlayStation  2 console is a 128-bit,  Digital  Versatile                                         5 Disk ("DVD") based system that is Internet and cable ready,  as well as backward compatible  with the current  PlayStation  console  software.  We currently have various products under development for the Sony PlayStation 2 console.  See Risk Factors - "New video game  platforms  create  additional  technical and business model uncertainties".           Nintendo           Nintendo  announced that it expects to release the Nintendo GameCube in North America in November 2001.  Nintendo  GameCube will provide for games to be delivered and played using a proprietary optical format.           Microsoft           Microsoft  announced  that it expects to release  its first  video game system, Xbox(TM), in North America in November 2001.           New Entrants           New  entrants  into  the  interactive   entertainment   and  multimedia industries,  such as cable  television,  telephone,  and  diversified  media and entertainment  companies,  in addition to a proliferation  of new  technologies, such as online networks and the Internet,  have increased the competition in our markets.  We are scheduled to release  several online  network  gaming  products during  fiscal  2002.  See Risk  Factors  - "New  video  game  platforms  create additional  technical  and  business  model  uncertainties"  and "The  impact of e-Commerce and online games on our business is not known ".           The early investment in products for the 32-bit market,  including both Compact Disk personal computer (or PC) and dedicated entertainment systems (that we call video game systems or  consoles),  has been  strategically  important in positioning us for the current  generation of 128-bit machines.  We believe that such  investment  continues to be  important.  During the fiscal year 2001,  the video and computer games  industry has  experienced a platform  transition  from 32-bit and 64-bit CD-based consoles to the current  generation 128-bit DVD-based game consoles and related  software.  The  transition to the current  generation systems was initiated by the launch of Sony's  PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2001, and continues with the anticipated  launch in North America of the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft's  Xbox in the Fall of calendar year 2001. As the market continues to shift to the current generation  systems,  sales of current 32-bit and 64-bit products have been declining and we expect a significant decline in fiscal 2002. In addition,  our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedule and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues  and  earnings  which  fall  short  of  analysts'  expectations  in any individual  quarter.  See Risk  Factors -  "Product  development  schedules  are frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult".           Online Games           According to the market research firm,  International  Data Corporation ("IDC"),  online  gamers  (defined as  individuals  who have played online games within the past year) are  expected to grow to 74.7 million by 2004 up from 39.4 million in 2000.  IDC expects total online gaming market revenue to grow to $1.7 billion by 2002.  We believe the  expected  increases  in online  gaming will be primarily attributable to the following factors:   o       Increasing popularity of PC gaming;   o       Growing interest in multiplayer games;   o       Growth in the number of households with PCs and Internet connections;   o       General  growth  in  internet  usage,  including  the  number of users,          communities and increased frequency of use by consumers;   o       Rapid innovation of new online entertainment experiences;   o       Mass market adoption of broadband technologies; and   o       Future  introduction of online gaming  capabilities for next-generation          consoles.   Competition           EA Core           See Risk Factors - "Our platform  licensors  are our chief  competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products".           EA.com  We believe EA.com faces  substantial  competition  from a number of existing and potential competitors including:   o       Console & PC Game  Publishers.  Other game  publishers  including  Sony          Computer  Entertainment of America ("Sony"),  Nintendo,  Sega, Acclaim,          Havas, Microsoft,  LucasArts, Interplay, Infogrames and Eidos, are each          developing  individual  online games and games with online  components.          Currently,  Sony (including the online divisions of Sony Entertainment)                                         6 operates the Sony Station, a site that offers not only  family-oriented          game shows, but also online game offerings,  including the online game,          Everquest,  a virtual world that directly competes with EA.com's Ultima          Online  game.  In  addition,  Sony has made public its  intentions  for          online connectivity via its next-generation console, the PlayStation 2,          though detailed plans have not been disclosed. In 2000, Sega introduced          SegaNet, an online gaming Internet subscription-based service optimized          for  use  with  its  Dreamcast  video  game  console.  However,  Sega's          subsequent decision to discontinue the Dreamcast will impact this plan.          In  2001,  Sega  executives  have  made  public  statements  about  the          company's  plans for  supporting  the online  gaming  functionality  of          consoles produced by Sony and Microsoft.  Each of these competitors may          compete with EA.com for advertising, subscription and e-Commerce sales.   o       Portals.  With respect to advertising and e-Commerce sales, EA.com will          also  compete with  general  purpose  consumer web sites such as Yahoo,          Excite,  Lycos,  and  Microsoft  Network.  In  addition,  many of these          Internet portals offer gaming sites such as Yahoo Games Channel, Excite          Games Channel,  Lycos' Gamesville,  and Microsoft Gaming Zone. Although          most of the game areas of these  portals have  attained  modest  reach,          their  key  placement  on  powerful   portals  makes  them  potentially          significant competitors for gaming subscriptions as well.   o       Family  Oriented  Game  Sites.  A number of sites  such as  Uproar.com,          Games.com and Shockwave.com, have driven significant amounts of traffic          to their sites by offering unique games and entertainment  content.  In          addition,  several of the sites offer frequent prizes with easy to play          "gamettes".  These  sites are  typically  monetizing  their  traffic by          selling advertising.   o       Aggregators.  Aggregators,  such as Microsoft  Gaming Zone,  provide an          aggregation of various types of online games,  including aggregation of          games  developed by independent  third parties.  While these sites have          been primarily focused on serving the gaming community, they have since          adjusted their strategy to include  games,  such as parlor games,  that          reach a broader audience.   o       Sports Sites. Sports content sites such as ESPN.com, Sportsline.com and          Foxsports.com  typically  feature fantasy league games and easy to play          sports "gamettes" in addition to their editorial content.  Such fantasy          league  games and sports  "gamettes"  typically  appeal to the  overall          sports fan,  rather than the sports  gamer.  However,  these sites have          significant  financial and content resources at their disposal and will          provide competition for advertising and e-Commerce sales.   o       Microsoft  Gaming Zone  ("MGZ").  Microsoft  falls into a number of the          foregoing categories, as it is a portal, an aggregator, and a publisher          of PC Software Products,  including game products. As such, Microsoft's          offerings are the closest parallel to the proposed offerings of EA.com.          MGZ currently  offers both family games and games directed  towards the          more  serious  gamer and,  at the same  time,  has the  opportunity  to          leverage these experiences with games sold at retail.  At present,  MGZ          offers  matchmaking  for about 80 games  and  offers  approximately  30          playable  online  games,  which  consist  primarily  of card and parlor          games. In addition,  Microsoft could utilize this site in some way with          its forthcoming Xbox console to develop an online gaming service.  Relationships with Significant Hardware Platform Companies           Sony           In fiscal 2001, approximately 20% of our net revenues were derived from sales of software  for the  PlayStation  2. We released 15 titles  worldwide  in fiscal 2001 for the PlayStation 2. Key releases for the year included Madden NFL 2001,  SSX,  FIFA  2001,  NBA Live 2001 and NHL 2001.  Revenues  were lower than expected due to the  shortage of  PlayStation  2 hardware in the year  resulting from  component  shortages  which  limited  the  number of units  that  could be manufactured,  according to Sony. We expect Sony to correct these issues for the next fiscal year,  and expect  revenues  from  PlayStation 2 products to grow in fiscal 2002.           In fiscal 2001, approximately 23% of our net revenues were derived from sales of software for the  PlayStation  compared to 41% in fiscal  2000.  During fiscal 2001, we released 17 PlayStation  games compared to 30 in fiscal 2000. As expected, PlayStation sales decreased for fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year primarily  attributable  to  releasing  fewer  games  and to the  PlayStation  2 platform  transition.  With the  exception of Madden NFL, all of our  franchises experienced  significant  decreases  from  prior  year  release.   Although  our PlayStation  products are playable on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of current PlayStation  products to continue to decline  significantly in fiscal 2002.  See  Risk  Factors  -  "Product  development   schedules  are  frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult".           Under  the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony Computer  Entertainment  of  America  in July 1994 (the  "Sony  Agreement"),  as amended,  we are authorized to develop and distribute CD-based software products compatible with the PlayStation.  Furthermore,  under the terms of an additional licensing agreement entered into with Sony Computer  Entertainment of America as of April 2000 (the "PlayStation 2 Agreement"),  as amended, we are authorized to develop  and  distribute   DVD-based  software  products   compatible  with  the PlayStation  2.  Pursuant  to these  agreements,  we engage  Sony to supply  its PlayStation  and                                         7 PlayStation  2 CD's and  DVD's  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have limited  ability to control our supply of PlayStation  and  PlayStation 2 CD and DVD products or the timing of their  delivery.  See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently  control the manufacturing of our video game products".           Nintendo           During fiscal 2001, we released three titles for the N64(R) compared to eight  titles  in  fiscal  2000.  In fiscal  2001,  approximately  5% of our net revenues were derived from the sale of N64 products  compared to 8% in 2000. The expected  decrease in N64 revenues  for the fiscal  year,  compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to fewer  releases.  The decrease was also due to the weaker  market for N64  products  in the  current  year.  With the  expected release of Nintendo GameCube in North America in November 2001, per Nintendo, we expect revenues for N64 products to continue to decline  significantly in fiscal 2002. The key release for the year was The World Is Not Enough.           Under the terms of the N64 Agreement, we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64 cartridges for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability to control  our supply of N64  cartridges  or the  timing of their  delivery.  A shortage of  microchips  or other  factors  outside our control could impair our ability to obtain an  adequate  supply of  cartridges.  See Risk  Factors - "Our platform  licensors  are  our  chief  competitors  and  frequently  control  the manufacturing of our video game products".   Relationships with Internet Service Providers           America Online, Inc. ("AOL")           Our agreement with AOL establishes  the basis for EA.com's  creation of game sites on the world wide web that are available to AOL  subscribers  via the Games Channel on the AOL's  flagship ISP service and to other  consumers who use other AOL portals (AOL.com,  CompuServe,  Netscape/Netcenter and ICQ). Users can also access the EA.com website directly from the world wide web. EA.com is AOL's exclusive  provider of a broad  aggregation  of online  games and  programs  and manages all of the Games Channel  content  within AOL's  flagship ISP service in the United States and other AOL portals. Within any of the AOL properties, users will be able to find a games  channel or area which will provide the user access to EA.com games. Through this agreement,  EA.com has significantly  expanded its EA brand as a provider of online games. According to the April 2001 Media Metrix reports,  the  total  number  of  unique  monthly  visitors  to the AOL  branded properties that will have access to the EA.com games site was 69 million. Via an anchor tenant location, EA.com will also be a non-exclusive provider of games on AOL's Digital City  property,  the leading  branded  local  content  network and community  guide on the AOL service and the  Internet.  For the terms of the AOL agreement,  see  note 5 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements, included in item 8 hereof.  Products and Product Development           In fiscal 2001,  we generated  approximately  59% of our revenues  from products  released  during the year.  See Risk  Factors -  "Product  development schedules  are  frequently  unreliable  and make  predicting  quarterly  results difficult".  As of March 31, 2001, we were actively  marketing  over 100 titles, comprising  over 150 stock keeping units,  or sku's,  that were published by our development  divisions  and  subsidiaries,  EA Studios.  During  fiscal 2001, we introduced over 35 EA Studios titles, representing over 55 sku's, compared to 48 EA Studios titles, comprising over 69 sku's, in fiscal 2000.           The  products  published  by EA Studios are designed and created by our in-house   designers  and  artists  and  by  independent   software   developers ("independent  artists").  We typically pay the  independent  artists  royalties based  on  the  sales  of the  specific  products,  as  defined  in the  related independent artist agreements.           For fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, no title  represented  revenues greater than 10% of our total fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 net revenues.           We publish  products in a number of categories such as sports,  action, strategy,  simulations,  role playing and  adventure,  each of which is becoming increasingly  competitive.  Our sports-related  products,  marketed under the EA SPORTS(TM) brand name, accounted for a significant percentage of net revenues in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our market share in the sports category.           The front line retail  selling prices in North America of our products, excluding older titles (marketed as "Classics"),  typically range from $35.00 to $55.00.  "Classics"  titles have retail selling prices that range from $10.00 to $30.00.  The retail  selling  prices of EA titles  outside of North America vary based on local market conditions.                                         8 We currently  develop or publish products for eight different  hardware platforms.  In fiscal 2001,  our product  releases  were  predominantly  for PC, PlayStation,  PlayStation 2, N64 and online  Internet play. Our planned  product introductions  for fiscal 2002 are for the  PlayStation  2, PC,  Xbox,  Nintendo GameCube,  PlayStation,  online Internet play, N64 and Game Boy Advance/Game Boy Color.  See  Risk  Factors  -  "Product  development  schedules  are  frequently unreliable and make predicting  quarterly results difficult" and "New video game platforms create additional technical and business model uncertainties".           Our goal is to be the  market  leader on the next  generation  of video game consoles.  We are investing in the  development  of tools and  technologies associated  with the  introduction  of the next  generation  video game  console platforms. We are also increasing the investment in the development of tools and technologies for online Internet game play and wide-area network infrastructure. Our goal is to be the  leading  provider  of  interactive  entertainment  on the Internet.   PlayStation  has  achieved  significant  market  acceptance  in  all geographic  territories.  However, as the PlayStation console market has reached maturity,   we  expect  sales  of  current   PlayStation   products  to  decline significantly  in fiscal 2002.  Most of the console  video game products will be convertible for use on multiple advanced  hardware systems.  We had research and development  expenditures  of $388.9  million in fiscal 2001,  $262.0 million in fiscal  2000,  and $199.4  million in fiscal  1999.  See Risk Factors - "Product development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting  quarterly results difficult".           EA.com Web Site           Content. EA.com offers games within three broad categories of interest: sports, family entertainment, and avid gaming. Each channel focuses on targeting and serving its specific consumer group by:   o       Offering engaging and accessible online games;   o       Building a community in which  consumers  can interact with one another          via chat,  bulletin  boards,  events,  and  match-making  services  for          multi-player games and other contests;   o       Delivering innovative content that continually entertains; and   o       Establishing a direct  relationship  with each audience  member through          personalization and customization of user experiences.       In addition,  the product offering of each broad category includes existing Electronic  Arts  franchises  adapted for game play on the Internet,  as well as additional  original  games for online  play.  EA.com's  products are offered to consumers  within  the  appropriate   "channels"  on  the  site.  The  offerings incorporate some or all of the following:   o       Sports.   EA.com   currently   leverages   existing   Electronic  Arts'          franchises, such as PGA(R) Tour/Tiger Woods Golf(R), Knockout Kings(TM)          and  Nascar  Web Racing to develop a  community  of sports  gamers.  In          addition,  EA.com will offer  unique,  original  online  sports  gaming          experiences,  sports  game shows and  support of  existing  EA packaged          goods products with services such as matchmaking, game updates, product          downloads and game tips.   o       Family  Entertainment.  With the Pogo  acquisition,  the EA.com  family          games  offering  has  significantly  expanded to consist of card games,          board games,  casino games, lotto games,  trivia games,  puzzles,  game          shows  and  other  products  with  mass-market   appeal.  This  channel          leverages prizes,  tournaments,  community and Pogo's strength in free,          familiar games to significantly  increase  EA.com's appeal to the broad          consumer market.   o       Avid  Gaming.  The  general  gaming  offering  is directed at teens and          adults looking to participate in  multi-player  hard core games made up          of fantastic  worlds,  characters,  adventures  or  activities  -big or          small,   real  or  imagined.   This  offering  will  feature  immersive          experiences and sophisticated  game play appealing to dedicated gamers,          as well as new forms of cutting-edge Internet entertainment. Currently,          this offering  capitalizes on the success of our existing Ultima Online          product as well as Electronic Arts' existing packaged goods franchises,          such  as Need  for  Speed  Web  Racing.  Upcoming  games  which  EA.com          anticipates   will  be  released  in  fiscal  2002  include   Majestic,          BattleTech, Motor City Online and Earth & Beyond.  Marketing and Distribution           Electronic Arts Distribution           We distribute EA Studio, Affiliated Label and Co-Published products.           We market our EA Studio products using the EA GAMES(TM),  EA SPORTS(TM) and EA  SPORTS  BIG(TM)  brands.  EA  GAMES  consists  of our  separate  brands, including Electronic Arts, Maxis,  Bullfrog Productions and Westwood.  EA SPORTS brand simulates  professional and collegiate  sports and includes titles such as Madden NFL, FIFA and NBA Live. EA SPORTS BIG brand simulates extreme sports such as the SSX game.           Affiliated  Label  products are delivered to us as completed  products. Co-Published  products  are titles we have  assisted  in  developing  with other software  publishers.  As of March 31, 2001,  we  distributed  approximately  20 Affiliated   Label  and   Co-                                          9 Published   titles  in  North  America  and  over  4,000  Affiliated  Label  and Co-Published  titles  in the  rest of the  world.  No  single  Affiliated  Label Publisher has accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.           In May 1998,  Electronic  Arts and Square Co., Ltd.  formed a new joint venture in North America,  creating Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA") as discussed  in note 14 of the  Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements, included  in item 8 hereof.  In  conjunction  with the  formation  of this joint venture,  we have the exclusive  right in North  America to distribute  products published  by this joint  venture.  In fiscal 2001,  Square EA  published  Final Fantasy 9 for the PlayStation,  which was a top ten selling title for Electronic Arts.           We generated  approximately 95% of our North American net revenues from direct sales to retailers  through a field sales  organization of  professionals and a group of telephone  sales  representatives.  The remaining 5% of our North American sales were made through a limited  number of  specialized  and regional distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical. For each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, we had sales to one customer,  Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc., which  represented 12% of total net revenues.           The  video  game and PC  businesses  have  become  increasingly  "hits" driven,   requiring   significantly   greater  expenditures  for  marketing  and advertising,  particularly for television advertising. There can be no assurance that we will  continue to produce  "hit"  titles,  or that  advertising  for any product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.           We have  stock-balancing  programs for our personal  computer  products that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount,  allow for the exchange of personal computer  products by resellers.  We also typically provide for price  protection for our personal  computer and video game system  products that,  under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price reduction from us for unsold  products.  We  maintain a policy of  exchanging  products  or giving credits, but do not give cash refunds. Moreover, the risk of product returns may increase as new hardware  platforms  become more popular or market factors force us to make changes in our distribution  system. We monitor and manage the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their  inventories as substantial overstocking  in the  distribution  channel  can  result in high  returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent  periods.  We believe that we provide  adequate  reserves for returns and price  protection  which are based on estimated future returns of products,  taking into account  promotional activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer inventories of our products and other factors.  We believe our current  reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection  requirements for current in-channel inventory.  However, there can be no assurance that actual returns or price protection will not exceed our reserves.           Within the EA.com site, we offer  visitors the  opportunity to purchase Electronic  Arts  software  products  directly  from us.  We  utilize  EA Core's distribution  network  to  fulfill  consumers'  online  orders.  We also  have a fulfillment  group that sells product directly to consumers  through a toll-free number and through our websites  listed in  advertising by us and our Affiliated Labels.  This group is also  responsible  for targeted direct mail marketing and sells product backups and accessories to registered customers.           The distribution  channels through which consumer software products are sold have been characterized by change,  including  consolidations and financial difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer  could render our accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, an increasing number of companies  are  competing  for access to these  channels.  In fiscal 2001, we wrote off approximately $1,000,000 of a receivable as a result of the default of payment from a customer in Europe.  Our  arrangements  with our distributors and retailers  may be  terminated  by  either  party  at  any  time  without  cause. Distributors  and  retailers  often  carry  products  that  compete  with  ours. Retailers of our  products  typically  have a limited  amount of shelf space and promotional  resources for which there is intense  competition.  There can be no assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide our  products  with  adequate  levels of shelf space and  promotional support.  Segment Reporting  The series of common  stock  designated  as Class B was  approved to reflect the performance of EA.com. Accordingly, management considers EA.com to be a separate reportable segment.  Prior period information has been restated to disclose this separate  segment.  The Company  operates  in two  principal  business  segments globally:   o       EA Core  business  segment:  creation,  marketing and  distribution  of          entertainment software.   o       EA.com  business  segment:  creation,  marketing  and  distribution  of          entertainment  software  which can be played  or sold  online,  ongoing          management of subscriptions of online games and website advertising.                                         10 Please see the discussion regarding segment reporting in the MD&A and note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   International Operations           We have  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  throughout  the world,  including offices in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Australia,  Canada, South Africa,  Singapore,  Sweden, Japan, Malaysia, Brazil and Holland. The amounts of net revenues,  operating profit and identifiable  assets attributable to each of our geographic  regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item 8 hereof.           International net revenues decreased by 14% to $490,349,000,  or 37% of consolidated  fiscal  2001 net  revenues,  compared  to  $573,374,000  or 40% of consolidated fiscal 2000 net revenues due to the following:   o   Europe's  net  revenues   decreased   21%  primarily  due  to  the  console      transition,  lower  Affiliated Label sales due to product release slips and      fewer hit titles  released in the current  year,  lower PC sales with fewer      titles  shipping  in the  period,  the  strong  sales of Command & Conquer:      Tiberian  Sun (TM) for the PC in the  comparable  prior  year  period,  and      weakness in the Euro currency. In addition,  PlayStation revenues decreased      43% due to fewer titles shipping during the console  transition period with      most  franchise  titles showing  significant  decreases from the prior year      releases. PlayStation 2 revenues did not offset the decrease in PlayStation      revenues due to fewer  hardware units reaching the market and the weighting      of titles  specifically  appropriate  for the North American  market rather      than the European market.   o   Asia  Pacific's  net revenues  decreased  4%, mainly due to the decrease in      PlayStation  revenues as there were no significant  new titles  released in      the current year.  This was offset by sales of PlayStation 2 titles such as      SSX and FIFA 2001.   o   Offset by Japan's net revenues  which  increased  58% compared to the prior      year  primarily  due to the shipment of  PlayStation  2 titles such as FIFA      World Soccer Championship, FIFA 2001 and SSX.           Though  international  revenues  are  expected to grow in fiscal  2002, international  revenues  may not grow at as high a rate as in prior  years.  See Risk Factors - "Our business,  our products, and our distribution are subject to increasing  regulation  in key  territories"  and  "Foreign  Sales and  Currency Fluctuations".   Manufacturing and Suppliers           Materials           In  many   instances,   we  are  able  to   acquire   materials   on  a volume-discount  basis.  We have multiple  potential  sources of supply for most materials,  except  with  respect  to our  PlayStation,  PlayStation  2 and  N64 products,  as  previously  mentioned.  We also have  alternate  sources  for the manufacture  and  assembly  of most  of our  products.  To  date,  we  have  not experienced  any material  difficulties  or delays in production of our software and related  documentation and packaging.  However,  a shortage of components or other  factors  beyond our control could impair our ability to  manufacture,  or have manufactured,  our products. See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products".   Backlog           We normally ship products  within a few days after receipt of an order. However,  a backlog may occur for EA Studio and  Affiliated  Label products that have been announced for release but not yet shipped.  We do not consider backlog to be an indicator of future performance.   Seasonality           Our business is highly  seasonal.  We typically  experience our highest revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end holiday season and a seasonal low in revenues and profits in the quarter  ending in June. In our 2002 fiscal year, and  particularly in the June and September  quarters,  we expect these seasonal trends to be  magnified  by general  industry  factors,  including  the  current platform  transition,  the  concentration  of our product releases in the second half of fiscal 2002 and uncertain  economic  conditions in the United States. In addition,  we are continuing to invest  significantly  in our online  operation, EA.com. Accordingly, we expect significant operating losses in the first half of fiscal  2002.  See Risk  Factors  -  "Platform  transitions  such as the one now occurring  typically                                         11 depress the market for video game software  until new  platforms  achieve a wide market acceptance" and "Our business is both seasonal and cyclical".   Employees           As of March 31, 2001, we employed  approximately  3,500 people, of whom over  1,400  were  outside  the  United  States.  Of  this  amount,  there  were approximately  700 EA.com  full-time  employees.  We believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified  employees is an important factor in our growth and development  and that our future success will depend,  in large measure,  on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  To date, we have been  successful in recruiting  and  retaining  sufficient  numbers of qualified personnel  to conduct our  business  successfully.  See Risk  Factors - "We face intense  competition  for talent from  competitors"  and "Because of the intense competition for qualified technical, creative, marketing and other personnel, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for our business".                                          12 ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES           Our  principal  administrative,   sales  and  marketing,  research  and development,  and support facility is located in two modern buildings in Redwood City, California,  20 miles south of San Francisco.  We moved into this facility in October  1998.  We presently  occupy  approximately  350,000 sq. ft. in these buildings under an operating lease for the buildings and certain  adjoining land that will expire on December 1, 2001. Monthly lease payments vary based upon the London  InterBank  Offered Rate. We have the option to purchase the property for the  unamortized  financed  balance at any time after the  non-cancelable  lease term, or we may terminate the lease at any time after the non-cancelable term by arranging a third party sale or by making a termination  payment. In April 1999, we exercised our option to purchase a parcel of land under the lease and sold it to a third party.  The proceeds  mitigated a portion of the occupancy  costs for this  facility.  Should we elect to  terminate  the lease,  we will  guarantee a residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized value of the property. As part of the agreement, we must also comply with certain financial covenants.           In December 2000, the Company entered into a second operating lease for the construction  and occupation of two buildings and a parking  structure to be constructed in Redwood City, California.  The initial term of the lease is for a period of five years from  December 8, 2000.  Monthly  lease  payments are based upon the  Commercial  Paper  Rate and the London  InterBank  Offered  Rate.  The Company has the option to purchase  the property  for the  unamortized  financed balance at any time after the non-cancelable lease term, or it may terminate the lease at any time after the non-cancelable  term by arranging a third party sale or by making a  termination  payment.  Should the Company elect to terminate the lease, it will guarantee a residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized  value of the  property.  As part of the  agreement,  the Company must also comply with certain financial covenants.           Our North American distribution is supported by a newly centralized and expanded  warehouse  facility in Louisville,  Kentucky occupying 250,000 sq. ft. The Hayward  distribution  center was closed in fiscal 2001 in conjunction  with the expansion of our Louisville, Kentucky facility. We also occupy sales offices in the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Chicago, Dallas and New York.           In addition to our Redwood City  development  studio,  we own a 206,000 sq. ft.  development  facility in Burnaby,  British Columbia,  Canada and rent a 33,000 sq. ft.  facility in Seattle,  Washington.  The move to the new  Canadian offices was  completed in June 1999.  We also own a 173,500 sq. ft.  development facility in Austin, Texas, and lease development facilities in Walnut Creek, San Francisco  and Carlsbad,  California,  New York,  New York and  Charlottesville, Virginia.           We own a 127,000 sq. ft. administrative, sales and development facility in Chertsey,  England, which our United Kingdom subsidiaries moved into in March 2000. In Europe, we also lease a distribution hub in Heerlen,  Holland,  as well as sales and distribution facilities in Madrid, Spain and Sennwald, Switzerland. Additionally, we have sales and administrative offices throughout Europe.           In Asia and the South  Pacific,  we maintain a 5,500 sq. ft.  sales and distribution  facility  in  Gold  Coast,  Australia.  We  also  have  sales  and distribution facilities in New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Korea, South Africa and Taiwan, and representative offices in Hong Kong and Beijing,  China. We also maintain a 27,000 sq. ft.  sales and  development  office in Tokyo,  Japan.  See notes 4 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated  Financial Statements,  included in Item 8 hereof.           We believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs. We believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate our future needs.                                         13 ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS           We are  subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the disposition  of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse  effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

All statements, trend analysis and other information contained below relating to markets, our products and trends in revenue, as well as other statements including words such as "anticipate",  "believe" or "expect" and  statements  in the  future  tense  are  forward-looking  statements.  These forward-looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and actual events or our actual future results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking  statements due to such risks and uncertainties.  We will not necessarily update information if any forward-looking  statement later turns out to be inaccurate. Risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results and  performance  include,  but are not limited to,  those  discussed  under the heading "Risk Factors" at pages 37 to 43 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of Fiscal 2001 to 2000:  Revenues  We derive revenues  primarily from shipments of  entertainment  software,  which includes EA Studio  products for dedicated  entertainment  systems (that we call video game systems or consoles such as  PlayStation,  PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 64), EA Studio personal computer products (or PC),  Co-Publishing  products that are  co-published  and distributed by us, and Affiliated  Label (or AL) products that are  published  by third  parties  and  distributed  by us. We also  derive revenues from licensing of EA Studio products and AL products  through  hardware companies (or OEM), selling subscriptions on our online gaming service,  selling advertisements  on our online web pages and selling our packaged  goods  through our online store.  Information  about our net  revenues  for North  America and  foreign  areas for fiscal 2001 and 2000 is summarized below (in thousands): Increase/                                                     2001                   2000       (Decrease)          % change                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- North America                                 $  831,924             $  846,637       $ (14,713)           (1.7%)                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- -----------------  Europe                                           386,728                486,816        (100,088)          (20.6%) Asia Pacific                                      51,039                 53,187          (2,148)           (4.0%) Japan                                             52,582                 33,371          19,211            57.6%                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- International                                    490,349                573,374         (83,025)          (14.5%)                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- Consolidated Net Revenues                     $1,322,273             $1,420,011       $ (97,738)           (6.9%)                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- North America Net Revenues  The decrease in North  America net  revenues for fiscal 2001  compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily attributable to:   o   Expected  declines in sales of  PlayStation  and Nintendo 64 ("N64") titles      due to the  beginning  of  the  transition  to  next  generation  consoles.      PlayStation net revenues  decreased 49% and N64 net revenues  decreased 46%      also due to fewer titles shipping in the current year for both platforms.   o   A 6%  decrease  in AL  revenues  primarily  due  to the  acquisition  of an      affiliate, DreamWorks Interactive, by Electronic Arts in the fourth quarter      of the prior fiscal year.   o   Offset  partially by the launch of  PlayStation 2 platform in North America      which  generated  $171,034,000  in revenue for the year from titles such as      Madden NFL 2001,  SSX, NBA Live 2001 and NHL 2001.  PlayStation  2 revenues      did not offset the decrease in PlayStation revenues due to a reduced number      of hardware units reaching the market due to hardware component  shortages,      according to Sony.   o   Offset by a 21% increase in PC revenues due to the shipment of key releases      including  Command & Conquer:  Red Alert 2 and The Sims:  Livin'  Large and      continued strong catalog sales of The Sims.                                         20 International Net Revenues  The decrease in  international  net revenues for fiscal 2001  compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the following:   o   Europe's  net  revenues   decreased   21%  primarily  due  to  the  console      transition,  lower AL sales  due to  product  release  slips  and fewer hit      titles  released  in the  current  year,  lower PC sales with fewer  titles      shipping in the  period,  the strong  sales of Command & Conquer:  Tiberian      Sun(TM) for the PC in the comparable prior year period, and weakness in the      Euro currency. In addition, PlayStation revenues decreased 43% due to fewer      titles  shipping during the console  transition  period with most franchise      titles  showing  significant   decreases  from  the  prior  year  releases.      PlayStation 2 revenues did not offset the decrease in PlayStation  revenues      due to fewer hardware units reaching the market and the weighting of titles      specifically  appropriate  for the North  American  market  rather than the      European market.   o   Asia  Pacific's  net revenues  decreased  4%, mainly due to the decrease in      PlayStation  revenues as there were no significant  new titles  released in      the current year.  This was offset by sales of PlayStation 2 titles such as      SSX and FIFA 2001.   o   Offset by Japan's net revenues  which  increased  58% compared to the prior      year  primarily  due to the shipment of  PlayStation  2 titles such as FIFA      Soccer World Championship, FIFA 2001 and SSX.

Key current year releases were Command & Conquer:  Red Alert 2 and The Sims:  Livin' Large.  We released 20 PC titles in fiscal 2001  compared to 31 titles in fiscal 2000.  The Sims  continues to be the number one PC title and has now sold over 4 million copies.  Due to the sales of The Sims in fiscal 2001, we expect revenues from PC products to be flat or lower in fiscal 2002.  PlayStation Product Net Revenues  We released 17 PlayStation  titles in fiscal 2001 compared to 30 in fiscal 2000. As expected,  PlayStation  sales decreased for fiscal 2001 compared to the prior year primarily  attributable to the PlayStation 2 platform  transition and fewer titles.  With the  exception  of Madden NFL, all of our  franchises  experienced significant  decreases  from the prior year  release.  Although our  PlayStation products are playable on the  PlayStation 2 console,  we expect sales of current PlayStation products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal 2002.  Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, we are authorized to develop and distribute  CD-based software products compatible with the  PlayStation.  Furthermore,  under  the  terms  of an  additional  licensing agreement  entered into with Sony Computer  Entertainment of America as of April 2000 (the "PlayStation 2 Agreement"),  as amended,  we are authorized to develop and distribute  DVD-based  software products  compatible with the PlayStation 2. Pursuant  to these  agreements,  we engage  Sony to supply its  PlayStation  and PlayStation 2 CD's for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability to control our supply of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 CD products or the timing of their delivery.                                         21 PlayStation 2 Product Net Revenues  We  released  15 titles  worldwide  in fiscal  2001 for the  PlayStation  2. Key releases for the year included  Madden NFL 2001,  SSX, FIFA 2001,  NBA Live 2001 and NHL 2001. Revenue was lower than expected due to the shortage of PlayStation 2 hardware in the year  resulting  from  component  shortages  which limited the number of units that could be manufactured, according to Sony. We expect Sony to correct  these  issues  for the next  fiscal  year,  and  expect  revenues  from PlayStation 2 products to grow in fiscal 2002.  Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues  The decrease in  Affiliated  Label net revenues for fiscal 2001  compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the strong sales of Final Fantasy(R) VIII in the prior year, our acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive, formerly an AL, in the fourth quarter of the prior year,  fewer hit AL product releases and product release slips in Europe.  N64 Product Net Revenues  We released  three N64 titles in fiscal 2001  compared  to eight  titles  during fiscal 2000. The expected decrease in N64 revenues for the fiscal year, compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to fewer releases.  The decrease was also due to the weaker  market for N64  products in the current  year.  With the expected  release of Nintendo  GameCube in North America in November  2001,  per Nintendo,   we  expect   revenues  for  N64  products  to  continue  to  decline significantly  in fiscal 2002. The key release for the year was The World Is Not Enough.  Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64 cartridges  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have  little  ability to control our supply of N64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery. A shortage of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.  Online Net Revenues  The  increase in online  revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the following:   o       The average number of paying  customers for Ultima Online  increased to          approximately  200,000 for fiscal 2001 as compared to over  140,000 for          fiscal 2000. This increase was due to continued  strong sales of Ultima          Online, the addition of new events and parties within the Ultima worlds          and the release of Ultima Online Renaissance in April 2000.   o       We generated over  $5,100,000 in  subscription  revenues for Kesmai and          Worldplay online games for fiscal 2001. These products were not part of          EA.com last year due to the Kesmai acquisition in the fourth quarter of          fiscal 2000.  Revenues  associated with these services will continue to          decrease  as  some  of  these  products  will  be  converted  into  our          advertising  supported  free offerings or  incorporated  in our bundled          subscription offerings.  License, OEM and Other Revenues  The decrease in license,  OEM and other  revenues for fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 was primarily a result of lower license revenue of certain titles on the Game Boy platform.  Advertising  Following  the launch of EA.com on the world wide web and the AOL Games  Channel in October, we began selling advertising on EA.com and AOL properties, including the Slingo game.  In  addition,  we  generated  advertising  revenue from Pogo's websites as a result of the  purchase of Pogo  Corporation  (now  referred to as "Pogo") in February 2001.

Cost of goods sold for our packaged goods business  consists of actual product costs, royalties expense for celebrities,  professional sports organizations  and independent  software  developers,  manufacturing  royalties, expense for defective  products and operations  expense.  Cost of goods sold for our subscription  business consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated  with  hosting  our  websites,  credit  card  fees  and  intercompany royalties for use of EA properties for subscription games.  Marketing and Sales.  Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel  related costs,   advertising  and  marketing  and  promotional  expenses.  In  addition, marketing and sales  includes the  amortization  of the AOL carriage and revenue share fees (now referred to as "Carriage  Fee"),  which began with the launch of EA.com in October.  The Carriage Fee will be  amortized  straight  line over the term of the AOL agreement.  General and  Administrative.  General  and  administrative  expenses  consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and  administrative  staff, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting and allowances for bad debts.  Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of personnel related costs, consulting and equipment depreciation.  In addition, research and development includes customer  relationship  management expenses associated with the  supervision of online play and the operation of Ultima  Online.  EA.com has research  and  development   expenses   incurred  by  Electronic  Arts'  studios consisting of direct  development costs and related overhead costs  (facilities, network and  development  management  and  supervision)  in connection  with the development and production of EA.com online games.  Network  Development and Support.  Network development and support costs consist of expenses  associated with development of web content,  depreciation on server equipment to support online games, network infrastructure, software licenses and maintenance, and network and management overhead.                                         25 Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues  decreased in fiscal 2001 due to:   o       An  increase  in sales of higher  margin PC titles as a  percentage  of          revenues.  The current year included  sales on titles such as The Sims,          Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 and The Sims: Livin' Large.   o       The introduction of higher margin PlayStation 2 products in the current          year.   o       A decrease in sales of lower margin AL and N64 titles.   o       An increase in higher margin Online and Advertising revenue.   o       Offset by a decrease in sales of PlayStation  titles  combined with the          decrease in average  margins on PlayStation  products due to a decrease          in the average sales price on front line and catalogue products.  Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2001 increased as a percentage of revenue, primarily attributed to:   o       Higher  EA.com  marketing  and sales  expenses due to  increased  staff          required to support the live game site and advertising campaigns run on          the AOL service promoting the Games Channel. In future periods,  EA.com          intends to further increase marketing and advertising spending in order          to promote our game site and the Games Channel on AOL.   o       The  amortization  of the AOL carriage fee, which began with the launch          of EA.com in October of the current fiscal year.   o       Offset by lower  television and print  advertising in North America and          Europe due to fewer number of releases compared to last year.  General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses increased 12.6% for fiscal 2001, primarily attributed to:   o       The expansion of the EA.com staff and additional administrative-related          costs required to support the growth of the EA.com business.   o       Increase in bad debts due to a write off of a receivable as a result of          the  default of payment  from a  customer  in Europe for  approximately          $1,000,000.   o       Increase in depreciation  expense for Europe due to the  implementation          of a new transaction processing system.  Research and Development  (excluding Network Development and Support).  Research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars by 38.2% for fiscal 2001, primarily attributed to:   o       Increase  in research  and  development  expenses by EA.com  (including          expenses incurred by EA Core on behalf of EA.com) due to an increase in          the number of online projects in development and increased  development          staff to  support  these  products.  The type of games  that will be in          development will most likely increase in complexity and depth.   o       An  increase  in  development  spending  for  next  generation  console          products including  development for the PlayStation 2 console, Xbox and          Nintendo GameCube.   o       The increase is also due to research and development  expenses  related          to the acquisition of DreamWorks  Interactive,  a software  development          company, in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.   o       Increased  headcount related costs associated with the formation of our          customer relationship management organization for the live game site.  We released a total of 55 new packaged goods products in fiscal 2001 compared to 69 new products in fiscal  2000.  In addition,  the EA.com  website  launched in October 2000, and has over 80 live games.  Network Development and Support. The increase in network development and support expenses was primarily due to increased spending for the network infrastructure, and the Games  Channel on the AOL service and the  amortization  of  capitalized costs  as  required  under  SOP 98-1  associated  with  the  pre-launch  network infrastructure  build.  As a result,  we expect network  development and support expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future.  Charge for Acquired In-Process Technology.  Fiscal 2001:  In  connection  with the  acquisition  of Pogo in the fourth  fiscal  quarter of fiscal 2001, we allocated and expensed  $2,719,000 of the  $43,333,000  purchase price to acquired in-process technology. At the date of acquisition, this amount was expensed as a non-recurring charge as the in-process  technology had not yet reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Pogo had various  projects  in  progress  at  the  time  of  the  acquisition.  As of the acquisition  date, costs to complete Pogo projects  acquired were expected to be approximately  $1,200,000  in future  periods.  We  believe  there  have been no significant changes to these estimates                                         26 as of March 31, 2001. We currently  expect to complete the  development of these projects at various dates  through  fiscal 2002 and to publish the projects upon completion.   In   conjunction   with  the   acquisition  of  Pogo,  we  accrued approximately $100,000 related to direct transaction and other related costs.  Fiscal 2000:   o       In connection  with the  acquisition  of Kesmai by EA.com in the fourth          quarter of fiscal 2000,  we allocated  and expensed  $3,869,000  of the          purchase price to acquired in-process technology.   o       In connection with the acquisitions of two development  companies by EA          Core, made in the 2nd and 4th quarters of fiscal 2000, we allocated and          expensed  $2,670,000  of the  purchase  price  to  acquired  in-process          technology.  These charges were made after we concluded  that the  in-process  technology had not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software.  Amortization of Intangibles.  The amortization of intangibles  results primarily from the acquisitions of Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks Interactive, ABC Software, Pogo and other acquisitions.  Amortization of intangibles was $12,829,000 for EA Core and $6,494,000 for EA.com for fiscal 2001.  Amortization of intangibles was $10,866,000 for EA Core and $1,123,000 for EA.com for fiscal 2000.  Interest and Other Income,  Net.  Interest and other income,  net,  increased in absolute  dollars  primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances and investing in higher yielding taxable securities in the current year.  Those gains were  partially  offset by realized gains on sales of marketable securities in the prior year.  Income Taxes.  Our effective tax rate was 31.0% for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. At March 31,  2001,  we  generated a federal  income tax net  operating  loss. A substantial  portion of this loss will be utilized in a carryback claim with the remainder being carried forward. A valuation  allowance has not been established on this loss  carryforward  or other net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more  likely  than not that the  results  of  future  operations  will  generate sufficient taxable income to realize them.  Net Income (loss). In absolute dollars,  reported net income (loss) decreased in fiscal 2001  primarily  related to lower  revenues  as well as higher  costs and expenses  compared to the same period last year.  The  decrease in revenues  was primarily  due to the  beginning  of the  transition  period to next  generation console  systems.  The  increase in expenses was  primarily  due to increases in development  of next  generation  console  products in the Core business and the investment  in EA.com,  including  expenses  to build  network  and online  game products and to launch our game sites in October 2000.  Excluding goodwill,  non-cash compensation and one-time charges in the amount of $17,077,000,  net of  taxes,  for  fiscal  2001,  net  income  would  have  been $5,995,000.  Excluding goodwill,  non-cash  compensation and one-time charges in the amount of $13,292,000,  net of taxes, for fiscal 2000, net income would have been $130,043,000.                                         27 Comparison of Fiscal 2000 to 1999:  Revenues  Information  about our net  revenues  for North  America and  foreign  areas for fiscal 2000 and 1999 is summarized below (in thousands): 2000                   1999         Increase          % change                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- North America                                 $  846,637             $  704,998         $141,639            20.1 %                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- -----------------  Europe                                           486,816                436,772           50,044            11.5 % Asia Pacific                                      53,187                 46,725            6,462            13.8 % Japan                                             33,371                 33,368                3             0.0 %                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- International                                    573,374                516,865           56,509            10.9 %                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- Consolidated Net Revenues                     $1,420,011             $1,221,863         $198,148            16.2 %                                     --------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- ----------------- North America Net Revenues  The increase in North  America net  revenues for fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal 1999 was primarily attributable to:   o       A 52% increase in PC revenues due to strong sales of Command & Conquer:          Tiberian Sun, SimCity 3000(TM),  as well as the fourth quarter shipment          of The Sims in fiscal 2000.   o       A 20%  increase in  PlayStation  revenues  due to more titles  released          during  fiscal  2000  including  Madden  NFL  2000,  NBA Live  2000 and          Tomorrow Never Dies as compared to fiscal 1999.   o       A 17% increase in AL revenues  primarily  due to the shipment of titles          published  by Square EA offset by the loss of an  affiliate,  Accolade,          due to its  acquisition by a third party in the first quarter of fiscal          2000.   o       These increases were partially  offset by an expected  decline in sales          of N64 products.  International Net Revenues  The increase in  international  net revenues for fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal 1999 was attributable to the following:   o       Europe's net revenues  increased by 12% primarily due to an increase in          sales of PC titles including Command & Conquer:  Tiberian Sun, Sim City          3000 and The Sims as well as an increase in PlayStation revenues due to          the  success  of FIFA  2000,  Tomorrow  Never  Dies and F1 2000.  These          increases were partially  offset by an expected decline in sales of N64          products.  Overall  European  revenues  were  adversely  impacted  by a          devaluation of the Euro in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999.   o       Asia Pacific's net revenues  increased 14% due to PC sales of Command &          Conquer: Tiberian Sun and SimCity 3000.   o       Japan's  net  revenues  were  flat  compared  to  fiscal  1999.  PC and          Affiliated   Label  revenues   increased,   offset  by  a  decrease  in          PlayStation  product sales  primarily due to strong sales of FIFA: Road          to World Cup and World Cup 98 in fiscal 1999.  Information  about our net  revenues by product line for fiscal 2000 and 1999 is presented below (in thousands): Increase/                                                 2000                 1999        (Decrease)       % change                                    ------------------ -------------------- ----------------- -------------- EA Studio: PlayStation                                $ 586,821            $ 519,830          $ 66,991        12.9% PC                                           397,777              270,793           126,984        46.9% N64                                          120,415              152,349           (31,934)      (21.0%) Online Subscriptions                          16,771               12,570             4,201        33.4% License, OEM and Other                        22,894               18,216             4,678        25.7%                                    ------------------ -------------------- ----------------- --------------                                            1,144,678              973,758           170,920        17.6% Affiliated Label:                            275,333              248,105            27,228        11.0%                                    ------------------ -------------------- ----------------- -------------- Consolidated Net Revenues                 $1,420,011           $1,221,863          $198,148        16.2%                                    ------------------ -------------------- ----------------- -------------- 28 Personal Computer Product Net Revenues  We released 31 PC titles in fiscal 2000 compared to 29 PC titles in fiscal 1999. The worldwide increase in sales of PC revenues was primarily  attributable to an increase  in sales in North  America  and Europe due to the success of Command & Conquer:  Tiberian  Sun  released  in the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2000 and continued strong catalog sales of SimCity 3000 released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. Other key titles for fiscal 2000 include The Sims and FIFA 2000.  PlayStation Product Net Revenues  We released 30 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 2000  compared to 21 in fiscal 1999. The increase in PlayStation  product sales was attributable to more titles released in the current  fiscal year compared to the same period last year.  Key releases  for fiscal 2000  include FIFA 2000,  Tomorrow  Never Dies,  Madden NFL 2000, NBA Live 2000 and Knockout Kings(TM) 2000.  Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues  AL product sales increased due to higher sales in North America. The increase in Affiliated  Label revenues was due to the  distribution  of titles by Square EA, including  Final  Fantasy(R)  VIII,  partially  offset by the termination of our distribution agreement with Accolade, which was acquired by a third party.  N64 Product Net Revenues  The expected  decrease in N64  revenues for fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal 1999 was due to the weak  market for N64  products as well as strong  comparisons  of World Cup 98 in fiscal 1999. We released eight titles in fiscal 2000,  including WCW(TM) Mayhem, compared to nine titles in fiscal 1999.  Online Subscription Revenues  Online  subscription  revenues are revenues  collected for Internet game play on our  websites.  The  increase in online  revenues for fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 was attributable to the following:   o       The average number of paying  customers for Ultima Online  increased to          over  140,000 for fiscal  2000 as  compared  to over  105,000 in fiscal          1999.   o       The increase in paying  customers was due to continued  strong sales of          Ultima Online,  the addition of new events within the Ultima worlds and          the  release  of Ultima  Online:  The Second  Age(TM) in October  1998.          Ultima  Online:  The Second Age added  features  including  new worlds,          monsters and an in-game chat feature.   o       We established  servers for Ultima Online in Europe in June 1999 and in          Japan in October 1998.  This local dial-in  capability  resulted in new          customers  in those  territories  for the fiscal  2000,  as compared to          fiscal 1999.  License, OEM and Other Revenues  The  increase  in  license,  OEM and other  revenues  was  primarily  due to the following:   o       License/OEM  revenues  increased  due to the sales of Game Boy(R) Color          titles in fiscal 2000.   o       Other revenues decreased primarily due to decreases in 32-bit products,          other  than  PlayStation,  as we no  longer  publish  games  for  those          platforms.                                         29 Operations by Segment  Information  about  our  operations  by  segment  for  fiscal  2000  and 1999 is presented below (in thousands): ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                           Year Ended March 31, 2000                                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              EA Core                 Adjustments and                                                       (excl.

31 The following table presents  pro-forma  results of operations  allocating taxes between EA Core and EA.com.  Consolidated  taxes have been  allocated to EA Core and EA.com on a pro rata basis based on the  consolidated  effective  tax rates, thereby  giving  EA.com the tax  benefit of its losses  which is utilized by the consolidated  group.  Such tax benefits  could not be  recognized by EA.com on a stand-alone basis. The sum of tax expense and tax benefit for EA Core and EA.com is the same as  consolidated  tax  expense.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues  decreased in fiscal 2000 due to:   o       An  increase  in sales of higher  margin PC titles as a  percentage  of          revenues.   o       An increase in sales of higher margin AL co-published titles which make          up a greater amount of total AL revenues for fiscal 2000 as compared to          fiscal 1999.   o       A decrease in sales of lower margin N64 titles.   o       Higher average margin for PC sales due to higher percentage of revenues          from internally developed and Intellectual  Property owned titles, such          as Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, SimCity 3000 and The Sims.   o       Offset by a decrease,  as a  percentage  of  revenues,  of  PlayStation          products.  Marketing and Sales.  Marketing and sales expenses increased in absolute dollars by 15% primarily attributed to:   o       Increased  print,  Internet and  television  advertising to support new          releases.   o       Increased  cooperative  advertising  associated with higher revenues in          North America and Europe as compared to the prior year.   o       Additional   headcount  related  to  the  continued  expansion  of  our          worldwide distribution business.  General and  Administrative.  General and  administrative  expenses increased in absolute dollars by 21% primarily due to:   o       An increase in payroll and  occupancy  costs to support the increase in          growth in North America and Europe.   o       Increased  general  and  administrative  spending  for  EA.com.  EA.com          expanded its staff and incurred additional administrative related costs          required to support growth of the business.                                         32 Research and  Development.  The increase in absolute dollars by 28% for research and development expenses (excluding Network Development and Support) was due to:   o       Increased  research  and  development   spending  due  to  the  ongoing          investment  in our  online  business.  EA.com  increased  the number of          online projects in development and increased development staff.   o       Additional  headcount-related  expenses  attributable  to the increased          in-house  development  capacity and a higher number of SKUs released in          fiscal 2000.   o       An  increase  in  development  spending  for  next  generation  console          products including development for the PlayStation 2 console.  We released a total of 69 new  products in fiscal 2000  compared to 59 in fiscal 1999.  Network Development and Support. The increase in network development and support expenses was due to increased  EA.com  spending  for network  infrastructure  in preparation  for new online  products and the EA.com game site. In addition,  we incurred higher  infrastructure  costs related to increased  server capacity for Ultima Online, allowing EA.com to serve a higher number of active subscribers.  Charge for Acquired In-Process Technology.  Fiscal 2000:   o       In connection  with the  acquisition  of Kesmai by EA.com in the fourth          quarter of fiscal 2000,  we allocated  and expensed  $3,869,000  of the          purchase price to acquired  in-process  technology.  Kesmai had various          projects  in  progress  at  the  time  of  the  acquisition.  As of the          acquisition  date,  costs to complete  Kesmai  projects  acquired  were          expected to be  approximately  $10,550,000  in future  periods.  During          fiscal 2001,  some of these  development  projects  were  completed and          launched on the EA.com  gamesites.  In addition,  as certain  games are          completed,  we expect  resources to be  redirected to ongoing live game          operations or to building the EA.com publishing platform.  As a result,          we do not anticipate incurring  significant future development costs in          relation to these  projects  after fiscal 2002.  We believe  there have          been no significant changes to these estimates.  We currently expect to          complete the  development  of these  projects at various  dates through          fiscal 2002 and to publish the projects upon completion. In conjunction          with the merger of Kesmai, we accrued approximately $200,000 related to          direct transaction and other related costs.   o       In connection with the acquisitions of two development  companies by EA          Core, made in the 2nd and 4th quarters of fiscal 2000, we allocated and          expensed  $2,670,000  of the  purchase  price  to  acquired  in-process          technology.  Fiscal 1999:   o       In connection  with the acquisition of Westwood by EA Core in September          1998, we allocated and expensed  $41,836,000  of the purchase  price to          acquired in-process technology.   o       Additionally,  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of two  software          development  companies by EA Core, in the first quarter of fiscal 1999,          we  incurred  a total  charge of  $2,279,000  for  acquired  in-process          technology.  These charges were made after we concluded  that the  in-process  technology had not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software.  Amortization of Intangibles.  The amortization of intangibles  results primarily from the acquisitions of Westwood,  Kesmai,  ABC Software and other acquisitions made in fiscal 2000. Amortization of intangibles was $10,866,000 for EA Core and $1,123,000  for  EA.com  in  fiscal  2000.  For  fiscal  1999,  amortization  of intangibles was $5,880,000  resulting from the  acquisitions of Westwood and ABC Software by EA Core.  Interest and Other Income,  Net.  Interest and other income,  net,  increased in absolute  dollars  primarily  due to  realized  gains  on  sales  of  marketable securities  and the sale of our  interest  in an  affiliate.  Those  gains  were partially offset by a write-off of a note receivable from an affiliate in fiscal 2000 as well as a gain on sale of land recognized in fiscal 1999.  Income  Taxes.  Our  effective  tax rate was 31.0% for fiscal 2000 and 38.3% for fiscal 1999.  The  effective tax rate was lower than the  comparable  prior year period  (excluding  the  effect  of the  one-time  charges  in the  prior  year) primarily  as a result of a higher  portion of  international  income for fiscal 2000  subject to a lower  foreign tax rate as  compared  to the prior year.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was  negatively  affected as there was no tax benefit recorded for a portion of the charges related to the acquired in-process technology.  Excluding the effect of these  charges,  the effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 would have been 32.0%.                                         33 Net Income. In absolute dollars,  reported net income increased by 60% primarily related to higher  revenues and gross  profits as compared to fiscal  1999.  The increase was also due to significant  one-time  charges for acquired  in-process technology in fiscal 1999. This was partially offset by higher costs incurred by EA.com  for the  development  of online  projects,  the  network  infrastructure development and higher infrastructure costs for Ultima Online and Ultima Online: The Second Age.  Excluding the one-time charges relating to acquired  in-process technology of  $4,512,000,  net of taxes,  in fiscal 2000, net income would have been   $121,263,000.   Excluding  the  one-time  charges  relating  to  acquired in-process  technology of  $37,506,000,  net of taxes in fiscal 1999, net income would have been $110,378,000.  Excluding  one-time  charges  related  to  acquired  in-process  technology  and goodwill amortization,  net income would have been $129,535,000 for fiscal 2000. Excluding  one-time  charges  relating to  acquired  in-process  technology  and goodwill amortization, net income would have been $114,376,000 for fiscal 1999.                                         34 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     As of March 31,  2001,  our  working  capital  was  $478,701,000  compared to $440,021,000  at  March  31,  2000.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term investments increased by $126,688,000 in fiscal 2001. We generated  $193,939,000 of cash  from  operations,  $102,628,000  of cash  through  the  sale of  equity securities under our stock plans, offset by $120,347,000 of cash used in capital expenditures in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2001, we invested $43,333,000 in cash for the acquisition of Pogo.     Reserves for bad debts and sales returns  increased from $65,067,000 at March 31,  2000 to  $89,833,000  at March 31,  2001.  Reserves  have been  charged for returns of product and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in prior  periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves  are  adequate  based  on historical  experience  and  its  current  estimate  of  potential  returns  and allowances.     Our principal  source of liquidity is $466,492,000 in cash, cash  equivalents and short-term investments and $10,022,000 in marketable securities.  Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated  from  operations  will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements on both a short-term and long-term basis.     Included in the amounts above is the following for the EA.com business:        o  With the  exception  of the  proceeds  from the sale of stock to AOL in          fiscal  2000 in the  amount of  $20,000,000,  to date,  EA.com has been          funded solely by Electronic  Arts.  This funding has been accounted for          as capital  contributions  from Electronic Arts.  Excess cash generated          from  operations  is  transferred  to  Electronic  Arts,  and has  been          accounted  for as a return of  capital.  We  anticipate  these  funding          procedures  will continue in the near-term.  However,  Electronic  Arts          may,  at  its  discretion,   provide  funds  to  EA.com  under  a  debt          arrangement,   instead   of   treating   such   funding  as  a  capital          contribution.        o  During  fiscal 2001,  EA.com used  $132,210,000  of cash in  operations          (including payments to AOL of approximately  $11,250,000),  $68,887,000          in capital expenditures for computer equipment, network infrastructure,          internal use software and related third party software, $43,333,000 for          the acquisition of Pogo, gross of cash received of $762,000,  offset by          $245,141,000  provided  through capital  contributions  from Electronic          Arts. As a result of the net operating  loss  generated,  we realized a          tax benefit of approximately $47,586,000.        o  During  fiscal  2000,  EA.com used  $68,329,000  of cash in  operations          (including payments to AOL of approximately  $36,000,000),  $37,605,000          in capital expenditures for computer equipment, network infrastructure,          internal use software and related third party software,  $1,499,000 for          an investment in a 3rd party developer, $32,539,000 for the acquisition          of Kesmai and  another  acquisition,  offset by  $140,410,000  provided          through capital  contributions from Electronic Arts. As a result of the          net   operating   loss   generated,   we  realized  a  tax  benefit  of          approximately $16,923,000.     EA.com is required to pay  $50,000,000 to AOL as a carriage fee under the AOL agreement.  Of this amount,  $25,000,000 was paid upon signing the agreement and the  remainder  is due in four  equal  annual  installments  on the  first  four anniversaries of the initial  payment.  During fiscal 2001, the Company paid AOL the first annual carriage payment of $6,250,000.  EA.com is also required to pay to AOL  $31,000,000  as an advance  of a minimum  guaranteed  revenue  share for revenues generated by subscriptions and other certain commercial transactions on the  EA.com  site.  Of this  amount,  $11,000,000  was paid upon  signing of the agreement  and the  remainder  is due in four equal annual  installments  on the first  anniversary of the initial payment.  During fiscal 2001, the Company paid AOL the first annual revenue share payment of $5,000,000.     EA.com  also  made  a  commitment  to  spend  $15,000,000  in  offline  media advertisements  promoting our online games,  including those on the AOL service, during the term of the AOL agreement.     Future liquidity needs of EA.com will be met by Electronic Arts as Electronic Arts  intends  to  continue  to fund the cash  requirements  of  EA.com  for the foreseeable future.  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards     In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133") "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",   as  amended  by  SFAS  137 "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective  Date of FASB  Statement No. 133 - an Amendment of FASB  Statement No. 133" and SFAS 138  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging  Activities - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" which  establishes accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments  and hedging activities. The terms                                         35 of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 are  effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company is determining the effect of SFAS 133, 137 and 138 on its financial statements.     In April  2001,  the  Emerging  Issues  Task Force  issued No.  00-25  ("EITF 00-25"), "Accounting for Consideration from a Vendor to a Retailer in Connection with the  Purchase or Promotion  of the  Vendor's  Products",  which states that consideration  from a vendor to a reseller of the vendor's  products is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor's products and, therefore, should be  characterized  as a  reduction  of  revenue  when  recognized  in the vendor's income  statement.  That presumption is overcome and the  consideration can be  categorized  as a cost incurred if, and to the extent that, a benefit is or will be received from the recipient of the  consideration.  That benefit must meet certain conditions described in EITF 00-25. The consensus should be applied no later than in annual or interim  financial  statements for periods  beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company is currently  evaluating the impact of this consensus on its Statement of Operations.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Euro Conversion       On January 1, 1999,  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing  currencies (the "legacy  currency") and the one common legal currency known as the "Euro".  From January 1, 1999  through June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their legacy  currencies  or the Euro to transact  business.  By July 1, 2002,  at the latest,  the  conversion  to the Euro will be  complete at which time the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender.  The fixed  conversion  rates between their existing  currencies have  eliminated  exchange rate risk among the member countries.       The conversion to the Euro has reduced the number of forward contracts that we use to hedge the exchange rate risk. The forward  contracts that were used to hedge the individual legacy currencies have been replaced by a single Euro hedge contract  and  the  intercompany  transactions  among  subsidiaries  within  the European Union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk.                                         36 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  RISK FACTORS           Electronic  Arts'  business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance. Some of those important risks and  uncertainties  which may cause our  operating  results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows:                     Risk Factors Relating to Our Core Business  Platform  Transitions Such as the One Now Occurring Typically Depress the Market for Video Game Software Until New Platforms Achieve a Wide Market Acceptance       When new video game platforms are announced or introduced  into the market, consumers  typically reduce their purchases of video games for current platforms in anticipation of new platforms being available.  During that period,  sales of our video  game  products  can be  expected  to slow or even  decline  until new platforms have achieved a wide market and consumer acceptance.  We are currently in such a transition.  Sony shipped its  PlayStation  2 product in Japan,  North America  and  Europe  in  calendar   year  2000.   For  the  December   quarter, manufacturing  shortages,  resulting  in the  delay of a  significant  number of shipments of  PlayStation  2 units in North America and Europe,  have  adversely affected our results of operations. In addition, Nintendo announced that its new console  system,  Nintendo  GameCube,  will be released in calendar year 2001 in Japan and North America and in calendar year 2002 in Europe. Microsoft announced that its new console  system,  Xbox,  will be released in calendar  year 2001 in North America and Japan and calendar  year 2002 in Europe.  Delays in the launch or  shortages  of these  platforms  could  also  adversely  affect  our sales of products  for these  platforms.  Current  sales of our products for the existing PlayStation  and  Nintendo 64  platforms  have been  adversely  affected (by the pending  introduction of new platforms).  We expect this trend to continue until one or more of these new consoles achieve a wide installed base of consumers.  New  Video  Game  Platforms  Create  Additional  Technical  and  Business  Model Uncertainties       Large  portions of our  revenues  are derived from the sale of products for play on  proprietary  video game  platforms  such as the Sony  PlayStation.  The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video game  hardware  systems and the life span of older  hardware  platforms  and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful.       Sometimes we will spend  development  and  marketing  resources on products designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved  large  installed bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than we expected.  Conversely, if we do not develop for a  platform  that  achieves   significant  market  acceptance,   or  discontinue development  for a platform  that has a longer  life cycle  than  expected,  our revenue growth may be adversely affected.       For example, the Sega Dreamcast console launched in Japan in early 1999 and in the United  States in  September of 1999.  We have  developed no products for this platform.  Had this platform achieved wide market  acceptance,  our revenue growth would have been adversely affected.  Similarly,  we released a variety of products  for the new  Sony  platform,  the  PlayStation  2.  The  shortages  of PlayStation  2 units has  adversely  affected our results,  and if that platform does  not  achieve  wide   acceptance  by  consumers,   we  will  have  spent  a disproportionate  amount of our resources for this platform.  Similarly,  we are developing  products for the Xbox and Nintendo  GameCube.  If these platforms do not achieve wide  commercial  acceptance,  our revenue  growth will be adversely impacted.  Product  Development  Schedules Are Frequently  Unreliable  and Make  Predicting Quarterly Results Difficult       Product development schedules,  particularly for new hardware platforms and high-end multimedia personal computers, or PCs, are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms and  the  learning  process,   research  and  experimentation   associated  with development for new technologies.  For example,  The World is Not Enough for the PlayStation  2 and EMPEROR:  Battle for Dune for the PC, which were  expected to ship in fiscal 2001 will not be released  until  fiscal 2002 due to  development delays.  Additionally,  development  risks for CD-ROM and DVD products can cause particular   difficulties   in  predicting   quarterly   results  because  brief manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates late in a quarter.  Our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to meet our product  release  schedules,  and our  failure to meet those  schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts' expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.                                         37 Our Business Is Both Seasonal and Cyclical       Our  business  is highly  seasonal  with a  significant  percentage  of our revenues occurring in the December quarter.  In our fiscal 2002, we expect these seasonal  trends to be  magnified by general  industry  factors,  including  the current platform transition,  anticipated fall launches of the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube in North  America and the economic  slowdown in the United  States.  In addition,  we are continuing to invest  significantly  in our online  operation, EA.com.  Our business is also cyclical;  video game platforms have  historically had a life cycle of four to six years,  and decline as more  advanced  platforms are being introduced. As one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new  platforms  are  emerging,  buying  patterns  may change.  Purchases  of products  for  older  platforms  may slow at a  faster  rate  than  sales of new platforms.  We are currently in such a platform transition.  Sega introduced its latest  platform in calendar  year 1999,  and Sony  shipped  its  PlayStation  2 console in Japan,  North  America  and Europe in  calendar  year 2000.  Nintendo announced that its new console system,  Nintendo  GameCube,  will be released in calendar  year 2001 in Japan  and North  America  and in  calendar  year 2002 in Europe.  Microsoft announced that its new console system, Xbox, will be released in calendar year 2001.  Sales of our current  products for the current  Nintendo and Sony  platforms  have already been  adversely  affected,  and we expect this trend to continue.  The Impact of e-Commerce and Online Games on Our Business Is Not Known       While we do not currently derive significant  revenues from online sales of our packaged  products,  we believe that such form of distribution will become a more significant factor in our business in the future. E-Commerce is becoming an increasingly  popular method for conducting  business with  consumers.  How that form of distribution will affect the more traditional  retail  distribution,  at which we have historically had success, and over what time period, is uncertain. In addition, we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and become a significant factor in the interactive games business  generally.  We do not know  how that  increase  generally,  or the  emerging  business  of  EA.com specifically, will affect the sales of packaged goods.  Our  Business,  Our  Products,  and Our  Distribution  Are Subject to Increasing Regulation in Key Territories       Legislation is increasingly  introduced which may affect the content of our products and their distribution. For example, privacy rules in the United States and Europe impose  various  restrictions  on our web sites.  Those rules vary by territory while of course the Internet  recognizes no  geographical  boundaries. Other countries such as Germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted over the Internet  that are stricter  than current  United  States laws.  In the United  States,  in response  to recent  events,  the federal and several  state governments are considering content  restrictions on products such as those made by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products.  Any one or more of these factors could harm our business.  Our Platform  Licensors Are Our Chief  Competitors  and  Frequently  Control the Manufacturing of Our Video Game Products       Our  agreements  with  hardware   licensors,   which  are  also  our  chief competitors,  typically  give  significant  control  to the  licensor  over  the approval  and  manufacturing  of our  products.  This  fact  could,  in  certain circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products  approved,  manufactured and shipped to customers.  In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform  licensors  increases both our manufacturing  lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve  independently.  For  example,  in prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining  approvals for and manufacturing of  PlayStation  products which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors.  Such occurrences would harm our business and  adversely  affect  our  financial  performance.  Additionally,  we have not negotiated  a publishing  agreement  with  Nintendo  for the  Nintendo  GameCube platform  and we do not  know  whether  the  terms  of  this  agreement  will be favorable.  Proliferation and Assertion of Patents Poses Serious Risks to our Business       Many  patents  have  been  issued  that  may  apply  to  widely  used  game technologies.  Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet  implementations  of existing games.  Several such patents have been  asserted  against  us. Such  claims can harm our  business.  We will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination  that we have  infringed  a third  party  patent,  we could  incur  significant  monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future.                                          38 Risk Factors Relating to Our Online Business  Because of EA.com's Limited Operating History,  It Will Be Difficult To Evaluate its Business and Prospects       EA.com's  business is still in the  developing  stages,  so evaluating  its business and prospects  will be more difficult than would be the case for a more mature business.  We will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced in  launching  a new  business,  and we may  not  achieve  our  goals  or may be compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the  business.  These uncertainties as to the future operations of EA.com will increase the difficulty we face in completing  and pursuing the essential  plans for the  development of the  business  and will also make it more  difficult  for our  stockholders  and securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business.  EA.com Has a History of Losses and Expects To  Continue To Incur  Losses and May Never Achieve Profitability       EA.com has  incurred  substantial  losses to date,  including  the  current fiscal  year.  We expect  EA.com to continue to incur  losses as it develops its business.  EA.com will be required to maintain the significant support,  service and product  enhancement  demands of online users, and we cannot be certain that EA.com will produce  sufficient  revenues  from its  operations to support these costs.  Even if profitability is achieved,  EA.com may not be able to sustain it over a period of time.  Our Agreements  with America Online May Not Prove  Successful to the Development of EA.com's Business        We have a  series  of  agreements  with  America  Online  ("AOL")  for the offering of our games for online  play.  These  agreements  require that we make substantial  guaranteed  payments to AOL and that we commit our resources to the pursuit  of  the  online  game  opportunity.  We  cannot  be  assured  that  the substantial  costs  associated  with the AOL agreements will be justified by the revenues generated from that relationship. In addition, restrictions included in the AOL agreements  limiting  other channels we may develop for offering  online games may limit our ability to diversify our online distribution strategies. The success for us of the AOL agreements will also be a result of AOL's  performance under the agreements, a factor over which we will have very little control.  We Have Very Limited Experience with Online Games and May Not Be Able To Operate This Business Effectively       Offering  games solely for online play is a substantial  departure from our traditional  business  of selling  packaged  software  games.  We have  employed various  pricing  models,  including  subscription  fees, "pay to play fees" and advertising.  We have very little  experience  with  developing  optimal pricing strategies  for online games and no  experience  in "pay to play"  pricing or in securing   advertising   revenues  for  online  services.   Similarly,   we  are inexperienced  in  predicting  usage  patterns  for our  games.  Because  of our inexperience in this area, we may not be effective in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online.  Online Games Have Risks That Are Not Associated with Our Traditional Business       Online  games,   particularly  multiplayer  games,  pose  risks  to  player enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales. Players frequently would not be  acquainted  with other  players,  which may  adversely  affect the playing  experience.  Social issues raised by a player's  conduct may impact the experience  for other players.  We have not  determined  whether or how we might monitor  or  proctor  player  behavior  that  impairs  the game  experience.  In addition,  there  are  substantial  technical  challenges  to be met both in the introduction  of our games online and in  maintaining  an effective game playing environment over time.  Also,  hacking and spamming has become a serious problem for online sites, and significant hacking and spamming could seriously interfere with  online  game play.  If these  risks are not  successfully  controlled  and technical  challenges  resolved,  potential  customers  for  our  games  may  be unwilling  to play in  sufficient  volume  to  allow  us to  attain  or  sustain profitability.  We May Not Be Able To Obtain the Required Licenses To Offer Our Games Online       If we are unable to reach terms with certain  licensors  for our games,  we will  not be able to  offer  certain  of our  games  for  online  play.  Many of Electronic Arts' most popular games feature  characters,  trademarks,  people or concepts for which we have licenses from third  parties.  As an example,  our EA SPORTS products  typically  contain content  licensed from a sports and players' association. In certain instances, the terms of these licenses will not allow us to offer the games for online play without negotiating an additional license. We cannot be certain  that the  licensors  will be amenable to a license for online games  involving  their  content or,  even if they are,  that we will be able to reach  terms  with  them for such use.  We may be forced to agree to terms  that ultimately materially impair the economic value to us of the online game market.                                         39 Proliferation  and  Assertion of Patents  Poses Serious Risks to the Business of EA.com       Many  patents  have been  issued  that may apply to  widely  used  Internet technologies.  Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet  implementations  of older  technologies.  Several such patents have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our business.  We will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination  that we have  infringed  a third  party  patent,  we could  incur  significant  monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future.  Development of EA.com's Business Will Require Significant Capital, and We Cannot Be Assured That It Will Be Available       EA.com will not be successful  if it does not receive the very  substantial financing  that will be required to develop its  business.  Electronic  Arts has agreed to provide a limited  amount of funding  to  EA.com,  but this  financing alone may not be  sufficient  for the  development  of  EA.com's  business.  Any additional funding that is obtained from EA may either be treated as a revolving credit  advance  or  would  increase  EA's  retained   interest  in  EA.com  and correspondingly  decrease the interest of the holders of  outstanding  shares of Class B common stock. The attraction of additional  equity or debt financing for EA.com  from third  parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms that result in significant  dilution to Class A and Class B common  stockholders or interest or other costs and debt-related restrictions on the operation of the business.  To date,  nearly all funding (except warrants and cash from revenues) has been provided by EA.  If Use of the Internet  Does Not  Continue To Develop and  Reliably  Support the Demands Placed on It by Electronic Commerce, EA.com's Business Will Be Harmed       EA.com's success depends upon growth in the use of the Internet as a medium for playing games. The use of the Internet for sophisticated  games like ours is relatively new. Our business would be seriously harmed if:      o    use of the Internet  does not  continue to increase or  increases  more          slowly than expected,      o    the infrastructure for the Internet does not effectively support online          game play,      o    concerns over the secure transmission of confidential  information over          public  networks  inhibit  the  growth  of the  Internet  as a means of          conducting commercial transactions, or      o    government  regulations  regarding  Internet content,  privacy or other          conditions impede the effectiveness of the Internet to users.  Capacity  Restraints  May  Restrict  the Use of the Internet as a Forum for Game Play, Resulting in Decreased Demand for Our Products       The Internet  infrastructure  may not be able to support the demands placed on it by increased  usage or the limited  capacity of networks to transmit large amounts of data.  Other risks  associated  with  commercial  use of the Internet could slow its growth, including:      o    outages and other delays  resulting from the inadequate  reliability of          the network infrastructure,      o    slow development of enabling  technologies and complementary  products,          and      o    limited availability of cost-effective, high speed access.       Delays  in the  development  or  adoption  of new  equipment  standards  or protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity, or increased governmental  regulation,  would cause the  Internet  to fail to gain,  or lose, viability as a means of game playing. If these or any other factors cause use of the Internet for commerce to slow or decline,  the Internet may not prove viable as a commercial marketplace. This, in turn, would result in decreased demand for EA.com's products and services.                                         40 To Become and Remain Competitive, EA.com Must Continually Develop and Expand New Content. This Is Inherently Risky and Expensive.       EA.com's  success  depends on our ability to develop  products and services for the EA.com  site and our ability to  continually  expand the content on that site.  Our  agreement  with AOL  requires  us to  develop  new  games  under our relationship  with AOL. We cannot  assure you that products will be developed on time, in a cost effective manner, or that they will be successful.  We May Not Be Able To Respond to Rapid Technological Change       The market for Internet  products and  services is  characterized  by rapid technological  change and evolving  industry  standards.  Both in completing the design and implementation of our network infrastructure and thereafter,  we will be  required to  continually  improve  performance,  features,  reliability  and capacity of our  network  infrastructure.  We cannot  assure you that we will be successful  in  responding  rapidly  or  in a  cost  effective  manner  to  such developments.  Increasing  Governmental  Regulation of the Internet  Could Limit the Market for Our Products       As Internet commerce continues to evolve, we expect that federal, state and foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user privacy,  taxation of goods and services  provided over the  Internet,  pricing, content and quality of products and services.  It is possible  that  legislation could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability, taxation or other  increased  costs,  any of which  could  limit the  growth  of  electronic commerce  generally.  Legislation  could dampen the growth in Internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications  and commercial  medium. If enacted, these laws and regulations could limit the market for EA.com's products.  Our  Revenues  Have Been  Heavily  Dependent  on a Single  Product  and Would Be Adversely Affected if That Product's Popularity Were To Decline       In the near term,  EA.com's  revenues to date have  consisted  primarily of revenues  from  sales  of our  online  product  Ultima  Online,  and we would be adversely  affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason and not be  replaced.  We expect the online game  market to become  increasingly competitive,  and it is possible that other  producer's  current or future games could cause our revenue from Ultima Online to decline.  In addition,  popularity of Ultima Online could decline over time simply  because of consumer  preference for new game experiences.  We Invest Very Heavily in Research and  Development  and Network  Technology and Operations  for EA.com,  and We Cannot Be Assured That We Will Achieve  Revenues That Validate This Level of Spending        We have  invested,  and  expect to  continue  to invest,  very  heavily in research and development  and network  technology and operations for our website and online games. We will need to expand EA.com's revenues  substantially for it to achieve profitability with these levels of expenditure being required, and we may not be able to do so. If we cannot increase  revenues to profitable  levels, the  value of EA.com  will be  impaired.  In order to  develop  the  broad  game offerings  that we envision  for our online  operations  it will be necessary to engage in significant  developmental  efforts both to adapt existing EA games to the  online  format  and to create new online  games.  Our  agreements  with AOL require us to maintain a substantial  commitment to online game  development and we  cannot  be  assured  that we  will  realize  acceptable  returns  from  this investment.  Online  Product  Development   Schedules  Are  Unreliable  and  Make  Predicting Quarterly Results Difficult       Online product development schedules, particularly for Internet based games are difficult to predict  because they involve  creative  processes,  use of new development  tools,  Internet  latency  issues,  a  learning  process  to better understand  Internet  based game  mechanics,  and research  and  experimentation associated  with   development  for  new  online   technologies.   Additionally, development risks for Internet based products can cause particular  difficulties in predicting  quarterly results because of the challenges  associated with game testing, live Beta testing,  integration into network servers and integration on to the Games web site and may impact the release  ("go live")  dates of products during a particular quarter. Several online products currently under development are experiencing development delays and will be released later than planned. Our revenues and  operating  costs are  dependent on our ability to meet our product "go live"  schedules,  and our failure to meet those  schedules  could result in revenues falling short of analysts' expectations, with no corresponding decrease in expenses, resulting in increased operating losses for EA.com.                                         41 General Risk Factors   Because of the Intense Competition for Qualified Technical,  Creative, Marketing and Other  Personnel,  We May Not Be Able To Attract  and  Retain the  Personnel Necessary for our Businesses       The market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential to the  development  of online  businesses and management of our online and core businesses  continues  to be  extremely  competitive,  and we may not be able to attract and retain the employees we need.  In addition,  the cost of real estate in the San  Francisco  Bay area - the location of our  headquarters  and largest studio has increased dramatically,  and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating   employees  to  our  headquarters  more  difficult.   If  we  cannot successfully  recruit and retain the  employees we need,  our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired.  Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations       For the twelve  months  ended March 31,  2001  international  net  revenues comprised  37% of total  consolidated  net  revenues.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000  international net revenues  comprised 40% of total  consolidated net revenues.  We expect  foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and  growing  portion  of our  revenues.  Such sales are  subject to  unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales are  primarily  made in local  currencies  which may  fluctuate.  While we hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot control translation issues. For example,  our  European  revenues  in fiscal 2001 were  adversely  impacted by a devaluation  of the Euro and British  Pound as  compared to the prior year.  The devaluation had an adverse effect for the year on our sales and net income.  Any of these factors may significantly harm our business.  Increased Difficulties in Forecasting Results        During platform transition  periods,  where the success of our products is significantly impacted by the changing market for our products,  forecasting our revenues and earnings is more  difficult  than in more stable or rising  product markets. The demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than we anticipate,  negatively impacting both revenues and earnings. At launch, Sony shipped  only  half of the  number  of  PlayStation  2 units to  retail in North America than it had originally planned, and it shipped significantly fewer units than  planned at launch in Europe as well.  Shortages  were  announced  as being caused by shortages of components for manufacturing. Due to these shortages, our results  of   operations   for  fiscal  2001  have  been   adversely   affected. Consequently,  depending  on  the  number  and  the  timing  of  units  actually available,  these  shortages  may  adversely  impact our sales of  PlayStation 2 products in fiscal 2002.  We cannot  predict the impact of recent  actions and comments by the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and FASB       Recent  actions and comments  from the SEC have focused on the integrity of financial  reporting.  In  addition,  the FASB and other  regulatory  accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting  standards, some of which represent a significant  change from current  industry  practices. For example, in December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial  Statements." SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition,  presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements of all public  registrants.  In  response  to numerous  requests  for  interpretive guidance of SAB 101, the effective  date of the standard has been delayed twice. SAB 101 became  effective  during the first quarter of fiscal 2001.  SAB 101 did not have a  material  effect  on the  underlying  strength  or  weakness  of our consolidated  business operations as measured by the dollar value of our product shipments and cash flows.  Fluctuations in Stock Price        Due to analysts'  expectations of continued growth and other factors,  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant  adverse effect on the trading  price of our common stock in any given  period.  As a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future, the market price of our common stock  historically  has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts' earnings estimates,  or to factors affecting the computer,  software,  Internet, entertainment,  media or  electronics  businesses or the  securities  markets in general. For example,  during fiscal year 2001, the price per share of our Class A common stock ranged from $26.59 to $56.13.                                          42 Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.                                          43 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Market Risk  We are  exposed  to  various  market  risks,  including  the  changes in foreign currency  exchange rates and interest  rates.  Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and short-term  investments are subject to market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables that are denominated in foreign  currencies,  thereby,  limiting our risk. Gains and losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement. At March 31, 2001, we had foreign  exchange  contracts,  all with  maturities of less than nine months to purchase and sell approximately $279,415,000 in foreign currencies, primarily British Pounds, European Currency Units ("Euro"), Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen and other currencies.  Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate. The  counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy   multinational   commercial   banks.  The  risks  of  counterparty nonperformance  associated  with  these  contracts  are  not  considered  to  be material.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks,  there can be no assurances  that our hedging  activities  will  adequately  protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.  The  following  table below  provides  information  about our  foreign  currency forward  exchange  contracts at March 31, 2001.  The  information is provided in U.S. dollar  equivalents and presents the notional amount (forward amount),  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value.   --------------------- ----------------- ------------ -----------------                                           Weighted-                                             Average                               Contract     Contract                                 Amount         Rate      Fair Value --------------------- ----------------- ------------ -----------------                         (in thousands)                 (in thousands) Foreign currency to be sold under contract:   British Pound               $155,842       1.4483            $3,477   Euro                          45,718       0.8792               120   Canadian Dollar               21,942       1.5267               687   Japanese Yen                  11,854     119.7900               611   Swedish Krona                  4,521      10.3969                 7   South African Rand             4,312       8.1159               (56)   Norwegian Krone                1,518       9.2235                (8)   Australian Dollar              1,284       0.4937                21   Danish Krone                     941       8.5009                 - --------------------- ----------------- ------------ ----------------- Total                         $247,932                         $4,859 --------------------- ----------------- ------------ -----------------  Foreign currency to be purchased under contract:   British Pound               $ 31,483       1.4160            $  (34) --------------------- ----------------- ------------ ----------------- Total                         $ 31,483                         $  (34) --------------------- ----------------- ------------ -----------------  --------------------- ----------------- ------------ ----------------- Grand total                   $279,415                         $4,825 --------------------- ----------------- ------------ -----------------  While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.  Interest Rate Risk  Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our  investments  to maturity.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Electronic Arts Inc. and Subsidiaries:  We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as  of  March  31,  2001  and  2000,  and  the  related consolidated statements of operations,  stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each  of the  years  in the  three-year  period  ended  March  31,  2001.  These consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Electronic Arts Inc. and  subsidiaries  as of March  31,  2001 and  2000,  and the  results  of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period ended  March 31,  2001,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.

All  significant  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  have been eliminated in consolidation.  (b)  Fiscal Year  The  Company's  fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week  period that ends on the Saturday  nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal 2001  contain 53 weeks.  The  results  of  operations  for fiscal  2000 and 1999 contain 52 weeks.  For clarity of  presentation  herein,  all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end.  (c)  Revenue Recognition  The  Company's  revenue  recognition  policies are in  compliance  with American Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue  Recognition",  and SOP 98-9,  "Modification of SOP 97-2, With Respect to Certain  Transactions",which  provide guidance on generally  accepted accounting principles for recognizing revenue on software transactions. SOP 97-2 requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each element of the  arrangement  based on the relative  fair values of the elements. The Company has adopted the  provisions  of these SOPs as of April 1, 1998.  The adoption  has, in certain  circumstances,  resulted  in the  deferral of certain revenues  associated  with the  Company's  sales  promotions  and products  with multiple deliverable elements. Neither the changes in certain business practices nor the deferral of certain  revenues have resulted in a material  impact on the Company's  operating  results,  financial  position or cash flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001. Total deferred revenue at March 31, 2001 and 2000 was $16,967,000, and $1,847,000, respectively.  In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101("SAB 101"),  "Revenue  Recognition",  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance for  presentation of revenue and for disclosure  related to revenue  recognition policies in financial statements filed with the SEC. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material  impact on the Company's  financial  position and results of operations.  Product  Sales:  The Company  recognizes  revenue upon  shipment of its packaged goods products based on "FOB Shipping"  terms.  Under FOB Shipping terms,  title and  risk of loss  are  transferred  when  the  products  are  delivered  to the customer.  In  order  to  recognize  revenue,  the  Company  must  not  have any continuing  obligations  and it must  also be  probable  that the  Company  will collect the accounts  receivable.  Subject to certain  limitations,  the Company permits  customers to obtain  exchanges  within  certain  specified  periods and provides price protection on certain unsold  merchandise.  Revenue is recognized net of an allowance for returns and price protection.  Online  Subscription   Revenues:   Online  subscription   revenues  are  derived principally from subscription revenues collected from customers for online play, who are only contractually  obligated for pay on a month-to-month basis. Prepaid monthly  subscription  revenues,  including  revenues collected from credit card sales  as well as  sales  of  Gametime  subscription  cards,  are  deferred  and subsequently  recognized  ratably over the period for which the hosting services are provided.  Advertising Revenues: Advertising revenues are derived principally from the sale of  banner  and  in-game  advertisements.  Banner  and  in-game  advertising  is typically generated from contracts in which either the Company or AOL provides a minimum  number of  impressions  over the term of the  agreed  upon  commitment. Revenue  is  recognized  as the  impressions  are  delivered,  provided  that no significant  obligations  remain and  collection  of the related  receivable  is probable. Advertising revenue generated on the AOL Games Channel is recorded net of the  applicable  revenue share owed to AOL under the AOL agreement  (see note 5).  Software Licenses: For those agreements which provide the customers the right to multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed  minimum royalty amounts,  revenue is recognized  at  delivery  of the  product  master  or the first  copy.  Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.  Revenue  from  the  licensing  of  software  was  $18,944,000,  $21,704,000  and $17,788,000  for the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  2001,  2000,  and  1999, respectively.  (d)  Cash and Investments  Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with  insignificant rate risk  and  with  maturities  of three  months  or                                         52 less at the date of purchase.  Short-term  investments  include  securities with maturities  greater than three months and less than one year, except for certain investments with stated maturities greater than one year. Long-term  investments consist of securities with maturities greater than one year.  The Company  accounts for investments  under  Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards  No.  115,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in Debt and Equity Securities",  ("SFAS 115").  The Company's policy is to protect the value of its investment  portfolio and to minimize principal risk by earning returns based on current interest rates. Management determines the appropriate  classification of its debt and equity  securities  at the time of purchase  and  reevaluates  such designation  as of each balance sheet date.  Debt  securities  are classified as held-to-maturity  when the Company has the  positive  intent and ability to hold the  securities  to maturity.  Securities  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are carried at amortized  cost,  which is adjusted for  amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.  Such  amortization  is included in interest income. Debt securities,  not classified as held-to-maturity,  are classified as available-for-sale  and are stated at fair value.  Securities  sold are based on the specific identification method.  (e)  Prepaid Royalties  Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties, original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid royalties are expensed at the  contractual or effective  royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on actual net product  sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization  of prepaid  royalties  quarterly  and charges to the  Statement  of Operations any amounts that  management  deems  unlikely to be realized  through product sales. Royalty advances are classified as current and non-current assets based upon  estimated  net product  sales for the  following  year.  The current portion of prepaid royalties,  included in other current assets, was $46,264,000 and $54,970,000 at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The long-term portion of prepaid  royalties,  included in other assets, was $9,664,000 and $11,373,000 at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  (f)  Software Development Costs  Research and development costs, which consist primarily of software  development costs, are expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,  "Accounting  for the  Cost of  Computer  Software  to be Sold,  Leased,  or Otherwise  Marketed"  ("SFAS 86"),  provides for the  capitalization  of certain software  development  costs  incurred  after  technological  feasibility of the software is established or for development  costs that have  alternative  future uses.  Under the  Company's  current  practice of developing  new products,  the technological  feasibility of the underlying  software is not established  until substantially all product development is complete,  which generally includes the development of a working model.  The software  development  costs that have been capitalized to date have been insignificant.  (g)  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories at March 31, 2001 and 2000 consisted of:  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               2001          2000 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                (in thousands)  Raw materials and work in process                          $   976       $   920 Finished goods                                              14,710        22,066 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            $15,686       $22,986 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  (h) Advertising Costs  The  Company  generally  expenses  advertising  costs as  incurred,  except  for production  costs associated with media campaigns which are deferred and charged to expense at the first run of the ad. Cooperative advertising with distributors and  retailers is accrued when revenue is  recognized.  Cooperative  advertising credits are reimbursed  when  qualifying  claims are  submitted.  For the fiscal years  ended  March  31,  2001,  2000 and  1999,  advertising  expenses  totaled approximately $75,429,000, $87,377,000 and $72,437,000, respectively.  (i)  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is calculated using the accelerated and straight-line methods over the following useful lives:  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------ Buildings                     20 to 25 years ----------------------------- ------------------------------------ Computer equipment and software                      3 to 7 years ----------------------------- ------------------------------------ Furniture and equipment       3 to 7 years ----------------------------- ------------------------------------ Leasehold improvements        Lesser of the lease terms or the                               estimated useful lives of the                               improvements ----------------------------- ------------------------------------  Under the  provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal Use", the Company capitalizes costs associated with customized  internal-use software systems that have  reached  the  application  stage  and  meet  recoverability   tests.  Such capitalized  costs  include  external  direct costs  utilized in  developing  or obtaining  the  applications  and  payroll  and  payroll-related   expenses  for employees who are directly  associated with the applications.  Capitalization of such costs begins when the  preliminary  project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which  the  project  is  substantially  complete  and ready for its intended  purpose.  Capitalized  costs  associated  with  internal-use  software amounted  to  $74,684,000  at March  31,  2001,  of which  $60,754,000  is being depreciated on a straight-line  basis over each project's estimated useful life.                                         53 (j) Intangible Assets  Intangible assets net of accumulated amortization at March 31, 2001 and 2000, of $136,764,000,  and  $117,236,000,   respectively,  include  goodwill,  costs  of obtaining product technology and noncompete  covenants which are amortized using the straight-line  method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the agreement terms,  typically from two to twelve years.  Amortization  expense for fiscal years ended March 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999 was  $19,323,000,  $11,989,000 and  $5,880,000,  respectively.  The  Company  assesses  the  recoverability  of goodwill by determining whether the carried value of the assets may be recovered through estimated future undiscounted net cash flows.  (k)  Income Taxes  The Company uses the asset and liability  method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and  liabilities  for the future tax  consequences  attributable  to differences between the financial  statement  carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.  The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not.  (l)  Foreign Currency Translation  For each of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries the functional  currency is its local currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S.  dollars  using  current  exchange  rates,  and  revenues  and expenses are translated  into U.S.  dollars  using  average  exchange  rates.  The effects of foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  are  deferred  and  included  as  a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) in  stockholders' equity.  Foreign  currency  transaction  gains and  losses  are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions  denominated in currencies  other than the functional currency.  Included in interest and other income in the statements of operations are foreign currency  transaction losses of $888,000,  $1,781,000 and $1,168,000,  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  2001,  2000  and  1999, respectively.  (m)  Net Income (Loss) Per Share  The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS") and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock method.  Net income (loss) per share was calculated on a consolidated basis until Class A common  stock and Class B common  stock were created as a result of the approval of the  Tracking  Stock  Proposal  (see note 2). Net income  (loss) per share is computed  individually for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Please see the discussion regarding segment reporting in the MD&A.

Net loss used for the  calculation  of Diluted  EPS for Class A common stock is $11,082,000  for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001.  This net loss  includes  the  remaining  15%  interest  in  EA.com,   which  is  directly attributable to outstanding  Class B shares owned by third parties,  which would be included in the Class A common  stock EPS  calculation  in the event that the initial public offering for Class B common stock does not occur.  Due to the net loss attributable for the twelve months ended March 31, 2001 on a diluted basis to Class A Stockholders, stock options have been excluded from the Diluted  EPS  calculation.  Had net income been  reported  for this  period,  an additional  5,971,000  shares would have been added to diluted  potential common shares for Class A common stock for the twelve months ended March 31, 2001.  Due to the net loss attributable for the twelve months ended March 31, 2001 on a diluted basis to Class B Stockholders, stock options have been excluded from the Diluted  EPS  calculation.  Had net income been  reported  for this  period,  an additional  472,000  shares  would have been added to diluted  potential  common shares for Class B common stock for the twelve months ended March 31, 2001.  Excluded  from the above  computation  of  weighted-average  shares  for Class A diluted  EPS for the  fiscal  years  ended  March 31,  2001,  2000 and 1999 were options to  purchase  2,705,000,  229,000 and  645,000  shares of common  stock, respectively, as the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common  shares.  For the  fiscal  year ended  March 31,  2001,  the weighted-average  exercise price of the respective  options was $48.63.  Class B common  stock,  authorized  on March 22, 2000,  was excluded  from the Company's calculations of basic and diluted EPS because its impact on the calculations was immaterial for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000.  (n)  Employee Benefits  The Company has a 401(k) Plan covering  substantially all of its U.S. employees. The 401(k)  Plan  permits  the Company to make  discretionary  contributions  to employees'  accounts based on the Company's financial  performance.  The Company contributed  $1,127,000,  $1,799,000  and $2,092,000 to the Plan in fiscal 2001, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively.  (o)  Stock-based Compensation  The Company  accounts for  stock-based  awards to employees  using the intrinsic value method in  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"  ("APB 25") and Financial  Accounting Standards   Board  issued   Interpretation   No.  44  "Accounting   for  Certain Transactions  Involving Stock Compensation (an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25)" ("FIN 44").  The Company has  adopted  the  disclosure-only  provisions  of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123").  (p) Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",   as  amended  by  SFAS  137 "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective  Date of FASB  Statement No. 133 - an Amendment of FASB  Statement No. 133" and SFAS 138  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging  Activities - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" which  establishes accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments  and hedging activities. The terms of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 are effective as of the beginning of the first  quarter of the fiscal  year  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The Company  is  determining  the effect of SFAS 133,  137 and 138 on its  financial statements.  In April 2001, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-25 ("EITF  00-25"), "Accounting for Consideration from a Vendor to a Retailer in Connection with the Purchase or Promotion of the Vendor's Products", which states that consideration from a vendor  to a  reseller  of the  vendor's  products  is  presumed  to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor's products and, therefore,  should be  characterized  as a reduction  of revenue  when  recognized  in the vendor's income  statement.  That  presumption is overcome and the  consideration  can be categorized  as a cost incurred if, and to the extent that, a benefit is or will be received  from the  recipient  of the  consideration.  That benefit must meet certain  conditions  described in EITF 00-25. The consensus should be applied no later than in annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after December  15,  2001.  The  Company is  currently  evaluating  the impact of this consensus on its Statement of Operations.  (q) Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Such estimates  include   provisions  for  doubtful   accounts,   sales  returns  and allowances,  warranty provisions,  and estimates regarding the recoverability of prepaid royalty advances and inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  (r)  Reclassifications  Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2001 presentation.                                         55 (s) Long-Lived Assets  The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets is measured  by a  comparison  of  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  to  future undiscounted  net cash flows  expected  to be  generated  by the asset.  If such assets are  considered  to be  impaired,  the  impairment  to be  recognized  is measured  by the amount by which the  carrying  amount of the asset  exceeds its fair value.  (2) TRACKING STOCK  On March 22, 2000, the  stockholders  of Electronic Arts authorized the issuance of a new series of common stock,  designated as Class B common stock  ("Tracking Stock"). The Tracking Stock is intended to reflect the performance of Electronic Arts' online and e-Commerce division ("EA.com").  As a result of the approval of the Tracking Stock  Proposal,  Electronic  Arts' existing  common stock has been re-classified  as Class A common stock ("Class A Stock") and that stock reflects the performance of Electronic Arts' other businesses ("EA Core").

These  investments are treated as  held-to-maturity  for financial reporting purposes.  The fair value of  held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 2001 was $8,601,000 which  included  gross  unrealized   gains  of  $201,000.   The  fair  value  of held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 2000 was  $18,162,000  which  included gross unrealized losses of $238,000.  (b)  Marketable Securities  Marketable  securities  are  comprised  of equity  securities.  The  Company has accounted for investments in equity securities as  "available-for-sale"  and has stated applicable  investments at fair value,  with net unrealized  appreciation reported as a separate  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) in stockholders'  equity.  Marketable securities had an aggregate cost of $7,066,000  and $15,000 at March 31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  At March 31, 2001,  marketable  securities included gross unrealized gains of $2,956,000.  At March  31,  2000,  marketable  securities  included  gross  unrealized  gains of $221,000.  There were no sales of marketable securities in fiscal year 2001. For the fiscal year ended March 31,  2000,  the fair value of  marketable  securities  sold was $8,604,000.  The gross realized gains from these sales totaled  $7,528,000.  The gain on sale of investments is based on the specific identification method.  (c)  Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts  The Company  utilizes  foreign  exchange  contracts  to hedge  foreign  currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany receivables  that are denominated in foreign  currencies,  thereby  limiting our risk.  The Company does not use forward  exchange  contracts for  speculative or trading purposes.  The Company's  accounting  policies for these instruments are based on the Company's  designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. The criteria the Company uses for  designating  an instrument as a hedge include the  instrument's  effectiveness  in risk reduction and  one-to-one  matching of forward  exchange  contracts  to  underlying  transactions.  Gains and losses on currency  forward  contracts  that are  designated  and  effective  as hedges of existing  transactions are recognized in income in the same period as losses and gains on the underlying  transactions are recognized and generally offset. Gains and losses on currency  forward  contracts  that are designated and effective as hedges of firm  commitments  are deferred and  recognized  in income in the same period that the  underlying  transactions  are settled.  Gains and losses on any instruments  not meeting the above criteria would be recognized in income in the current period. The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies. At March 31, 2001, the Company had foreign exchange contracts,  all with maturities of less than                                          56 seven  months,  to  purchase  and sell  approximately  $279,415,000  in  foreign currencies,  primarily in British Pounds,  Euro, Canadian Dollars,  Japanese Yen and other European currencies.  Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate,  plus the  unamortized  premium or discount.  At March 31, 2001, fair value of these contracts is $4,825,000.  The  counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy  multinational  commercial banks. The risks of  counterparty  nonperformance  associated  with these contracts are not considered  to be  material.  Notwithstanding  our  efforts  to  manage  foreign exchange  risk,  there can be no  assurances  that our hedging  activities  will adequately  protect  us  against  the risks  associated  with  foreign  currency fluctuations.  (4)  COMMITMENTS  The Company leases certain of its current facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable  capital and operating lease agreements.  The Company is required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of its facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of the Company's facilities.  In  February  1995,  the  Company  entered  into a master  operating  lease,  as subsequently  amended,  for the  purchase  of land  and  construction  of  three buildings and a parking structure in Redwood City, California.  The initial term of the lease is for a period of three  years from  November  30,  1998.  Monthly lease payments are based upon the London InterBank Offered Rate. The Company has the option to purchase the property for the unamortized  financed balance at any time after the  non-cancelable  lease term, or it may terminate the lease at any time after the non-cancelable  term by arranging a third party sale or by making a termination payment.  Should the Company elect to terminate the lease, it will guarantee  a  residual  value  of up to  85%  of the  unamortized  value  of the property.  As part of the  agreement,  the Company must also comply with certain financial covenants.  In December  2000,  the Company  entered into a second  operating  lease for the construction  and  occupation  of two  buildings  and a parking  structure to be constructed in Redwood City, California.  The initial term of the lease is for a period of five years from  December 8, 2000.  Monthly  lease  payments are based upon the  Commercial  Paper  Rate and the London  InterBank  Offered  Rate.  The Company has the option to purchase  the property  for the  unamortized  financed balance at any time after the non-cancelable lease term, or it may terminate the lease at any time after the non-cancelable  term by arranging a third party sale or by making a  termination  payment.  Should the Company elect to terminate the lease, it will guarantee a residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized  value of the  property.  As part of the  agreement,  the Company must also comply with certain financial covenants.  Total future minimum lease commitments as of March 31, 2001 are:  --------------------------------------- ------------------ Year Ended March 31,                     (in thousands)    2002                                           $20,905    2003                                            13,887    2004                                            10,542    2005                                             8,279    2006                                             7,874    Thereafter                                      16,526 --------------------------------------- ------------------                                                   $78,013 --------------------------------------- ------------------  Total rent expense for all operating  leases was  $27,526,000,  $23,591,000  and $19,480,000,  for the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  2001,  2000  and  1999, respectively.  (5) AMERICA ONLINE, INC. ("AOL") AGREEMENT  In November 1999,  Electronic Arts Inc., EA.com and AOL entered into a five year agreement which establishes the basis for EA.com's production of a games site on the world wide web that will be  available  to AOL  subscribers  and to users of other branded AOL properties.  The Company is required to pay  $50,000,000  to AOL as a carriage  fee under the AOL agreement.  Of this amount,  $25,000,000 was paid upon signing the agreement and  the  remainder  is  due in  four  equal  installments  on  the  first  four anniversaries of the initial  payment.  During fiscal 2001, the Company paid AOL the first annual carriage payment of $6,250,000. The Company is also required to pay to AOL $31,000,000 as an advance of a minimum  guaranteed  revenue share for revenues generated by subscriptions and other certain commercial transactions on the  EA.com  site.  Of this  amount  $11,000,000  was paid upon  signing  of the agreement  and the  remainder  is due in four equal annual  installments  on the first  anniversary of the initial payment.  During fiscal 2001, the Company paid AOL the first annual revenue share payment of $5,000,000.  The fair value of the payments made under the AOL agreement was determined by an independent valuation and the resulting  amounts are being amortized  (beginning with the site launch) over the remaining term of the five-year agreement.  Advances of $41,462,000 and $35,395,000  are  included  in other  long-term  assets as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The Company also committed to spend $15,000,000 in offline media  advertisements promoting its games on AOL during the term of the agreement.  Sale of Class B Common Stock and Warrant to AOL  In connection  with the  agreement  with AOL, the Company sold shares of Class B common stock to AOL (the "AOL                                         57 Shares")  representing  10 percent of the initial equity value  attributable  to EA.com valued at $18,700,000.  In  addition  to the AOL  Shares,  the  Company  sold AOL a  warrant  (the  "AOL Warrant") to purchase shares of Class B common stock  representing an additional 5 percent of the initial equity value attributable to EA.com for $1,300,000. The aggregate exercise price of the AOL Warrant will be $40,000,000. The AOL Warrant expires  at the latest at the fifth  anniversary  of its date of  issuance,  and under certain conditions may expire at an earlier date.  AOL Exchange Rights  AOL may  exchange  their  Class B common  stock  shares  for a number of Class A common  stock  based on the ratio of per share price paid by AOL for the Class B stock relative to $41.89. As of March 31, 2001, none of the AOL shares have been exchanged for Class A common stock.  (6)  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  The  Company  extends  credit  to  various  companies  in the  retail  and  mass merchandising  industry.  Collection  of trade  receivables  may be  affected by changes in economic or other industry  conditions and may,  accordingly,  impact the  Company's  overall  credit risk.  Although the Company  generally  does not require  collateral,  the Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations of its customers and reserves for potential credit losses are maintained.  Short-term   investments   are  placed   with  high   credit-quality   financial institutions or in short-duration  high quality  securities.  The Company limits the  amount of credit  exposure  in any one  institution  or type of  investment instrument.  (7)  LITIGATION  The  Company  is subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon the consolidated financial condition of the Company.  (8)  STOCK SPLIT  On August 14, 2000,  the Company's  Board of Directors  authorized a two-for-one stock split of its Class A common  stock which was  distributed  on September 8, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend for  shareholders of record at the close of business on August 25, 2000. All authorized and outstanding  share and per share amounts  of Class A  common  stock in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial statements for all periods have been restated to reflect the stock split.   (9)  PREFERRED STOCK  At March 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock authorized  but  unissued.  The rights,  preferences,  and  restrictions  of the Preferred  Stock may be  designated  by the Board of Directors  without  further action by the Company's stockholders.  (10) TREASURY STOCK  In February 1999,  the Board of Directors  approved a plan to purchase up to two million shares of the Company's common stock. For the years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,  the Company did not repurchase  shares.  For the year ended March 31, 1999, the Company repurchased 446,000 shares for approximately  $9,001,000 under this  program.  For the fiscal year ended March 31,  2001,  there were no shares reissued  under the Company's  Stock Plans.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000,  246,000  shares were reissued  under the Company's  Stock Plans.  For the fiscal  year ended  March 31,  1999,  200,000  shares  were  reissued  under the Company's Stock Plans.  When treasury shares were reissued,  any excess of the average  acquisition cost of the  shares  over the  proceeds  from  reissuance  was  charged  to  retained earnings.   (11) STOCK PLANS  (a)  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  The  Company  has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  program  whereby  eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation to purchase  shares  at 85% of the  lower of the fair  market  value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of  commencement  of the offering or on the last day of the  six-month  purchase  period.  The program  commenced in September  1991. In fiscal 2001,  350,164  shares were  purchased by the Company and  distributed to employees  at prices  ranging  from $29.14 to $42.50.  In fiscal  2000,  491,046 shares were  purchased  by the Company and  distributed  to  employees at prices ranging from $16.21 to $29.14. In fiscal 1999,  483,028 shares were purchased by the  Company and  distributed  to  employees  at prices  ranging  from $13.10 to $18.30.  The weighted  average  fair value of the fiscal  2001,  fiscal 2000 and fiscal  1999  awards  was  $18.31,  $10.00 and  $9.14,  respectively.  Under the Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan 62,000  shares were  distributed  from  reissued treasury stock in fiscal 1999. No shares were distributed from reissued treasury stock in fiscal  2001 or  fiscal  2000.  At March  31,  2001,  the  Company  had 1,383,678  shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for future issuance under the Plan.  (b) Stock Option Plans  The Company's 2000 Class A Equity  Incentive  Plan, 1991 Stock Option Plan, 1993 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Stock Option Plan, and Directors' Plan ("Option  Plans") provide options for employees,  officers and directors to purchase the                                          58 Company's  Class A common stock.  Pursuant to these Option  Plans,  the Board of Directors may grant  non-qualified  and incentive stock options to employees and officers  and  non-qualified  options  to  directors,  at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.  Under the Company's stock option plans, 246,000 and 138,000 shares were reissued from  treasury  stock in fiscal  2000 and  1999,  respectively.  No shares  were distributed from reissued treasury stock in fiscal 2001.  Together  with the  Tracking  Stock  Proposal,  the  stockholders  approved  the Electronic Arts Inc. 2000 Class B Equity Incentive Plan. The Class B equity plan allows the award of stock options or restricted  stock for up to an aggregate of 6,000,000  shares of Class B common stock. The Class B plan includes a provision for automatic option grants to the Company's outside directors.  As of March 31, 2001 there were 250,000 restricted shares issued under the Class B equity plan.  In the fiscal year 2001, the Board of Directors approved the Key Partner Class B Equity  Incentive  Program  which  allows for the  issuance  of  warrants to key business partners to purchase up to 750,000 shares of Class B common stock.  The options  generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable in monthly  increments  over 50 months.  Class B common stock grants will generally vest over 50 months with 2% vesting per month.  The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123").  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for options granted under the Company's  employee-based stock option plans. Had compensation expense  been  determined  based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans in accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's pro forma net income  (loss) and net  income  (loss) per share for fiscal  2001, 2000 and 1999 would have been:  Consolidated (In thousands, except per share data) ---------------------------- ------------ ----------- -----------                                     2001        2000        1999 ---------------------------- ------------ ----------- ----------- Net income (loss):    As reported                 $(11,082)    $116,751     $72,872    Pro forma                   $(69,350)    $ 78,380     $45,886  Earnings per share:    As reported - basic               N/A    $   0.93     $  0.60    Pro forma - basic                 N/A    $   0.62     $  0.38    As reported - diluted             N/A    $   0.88     $  0.58    Pro forma - diluted               N/A    $   0.60     $  0.37 ---------------------------- ------------ ----------- -----------   Class A Common Stock (In thousands, except per share data) ---------------------------- ------------ ----------- -----------                                     2001        2000        1999 ---------------------------- ------------ ----------- ----------- Net income (loss):    As reported - basic         $ 11,944          N/A         N/A    Pro forma - basic           $(45,493)         N/A         N/A    As reported - diluted       $(11,082)         N/A         N/A    Pro forma - diluted         $(69,350)         N/A         N/A  Earnings (loss) per share:    As reported - basic         $   0.09          N/A         N/A    Pro forma - basic           $  (0.35)         N/A         N/A    As reported - diluted       $  (0.08)         N/A         N/A    Pro forma - diluted         $  (0.53)         N/A         N/A ---------------------------- ------------ ----------- -----------  The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes  option-pricing model.

Pogo operates an ad-supported games service that reaches a broad consumer market. Pogo's internet-based family games focus on easy-to-play card, board and puzzle games.  The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method. The results of operations of Pogo and the estimated  fair market values of the acquired  assets and liabilities have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of  acquisition.  The adjusted  allocation of the excess purchase price over the net  tangible  assets  acquired  was  $40,516,000,  of which,  based on management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation consultant,  $2,719,000  was  allocated  to  purchased  in-process  research and development and $37,797,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts allocated  to  other  intangibles  include  goodwill  of  $16,927,000,  existing technology of $12,505,000,  and other intangibles of $8,365,000.  The allocation of  intangible  assets is being  amortized  on a straight  line basis over lives ranging from three to seven years.  Purchased  in-process research and development includes the value of products in the  development  stage that are not  considered  to have reached  technological feasibility or to have alternative future use.  Accordingly,  this non-recurring item was expensed in the Consolidated  Statement of Operations upon consummation of the  acquisition.  The  non-recurring  charge  for  in-process  research  and development increased diluted loss per share by approximately $0.01 and $0.07 in the fiscal year 2001 for Class A and Class B, respectively.  Pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition.  As of the acquisition  date, costs to complete Pogo projects  acquired were expected to be approximately $1,200,000 in future periods. The Company believes there have been no  significant  changes to these  estimates as of March 31,  2001.  The Company currently expects to complete the development of these projects at various dates through fiscal 2002 and to publish the projects upon completion.  In conjunction with the acquisition of Pogo, the Company accrued approximately $100,000 related to direct transaction costs and other related costs.

The Company  granted 5 percent of the initial equity  attributable  to EA.com to News Corp, adjusting the total common stock consideration  relating to the acquisition by $703,000 to $9,353,000. The Company has contributed Kesmai to EA.com.  The Company is also committed to spend  $5,000,000 in advertising with News Corp or any of its affiliates.  If a qualified  public  offering of Class B common  stock does not occur  within twenty-four  months of News Corp's  purchase of such shares,  then News Corp has the right to (1) exchange Class B common stock for approximately  206,000 shares of Class A common stock, and (2) receive cash from Electronic Arts in the amount of $9,650,000.  The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method. The results of operations of Kesmai and the estimated fair market values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of  acquisition.  The adjusted  allocation of the excess purchase price over the net tangible  liabilities  assumed was $32,815,000,  of which, based on management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation consultant,  $3,869,000  was  allocated  to  purchased  in-process  research and development and $28,946,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts allocated  to  other  intangibles  include  goodwill  of  $18,932,000,  existing technology  of  $3,992,000,  amounts  attributed  to a prior  AOL  agreement  of $3,131,000 and other  intangibles  of  $2,891,000.  The allocation of intangible assets is being amortized over lives ranging from two to seven years.  Purchased  in-process research and development includes the value of products in the  development  stage that are not  considered  to have reached  technological feasibility or to have alternative future use.  Accordingly,  this non-recurring item was expensed in the Consolidated  Statement of Operations upon consummation of the  acquisition.  The  non-recurring  charge  for  in-process  research  and development reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.02 in the fiscal year 2000.  Kesmai had various  projects in progress at the time of the  acquisition.  As of the  acquisition   date,  costs  to  complete  Kesmai  projects   acquired  were approximately  $10,550,000 in future periods.  During fiscal 2001, some of these development  projects were  completed and launched on the EA.com  gamesites.  In addition,  as certain games are completed,  we expect resources to be redirected to ongoing live game operations or to building the EA.com  publishing  platform. As a result, we do not anticipate incurring                                         63 significant  future development costs in relation to these projects after fiscal 2002.  The  Company  believes  there have been no  significant  changes to these estimates as of March 31, 2001.  The Company  currently  expects to complete the development  of these  projects  at various  dates  through  fiscal  2002 and to publish the projects upon  completion.  In conjunction  with the  acquisition of Kesmai, the Company accrued approximately $200,000 related to direct transaction costs and other related costs.  The purchase price for the Kesmai  transaction  was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as set forth below (in thousands):  ------------------------------------------ --------------------- Current assets                                          $   605 Fixed assets (net of depreciation)                          759 In-process technology                                     3,869 Goodwill and other intangibles                           28,946 Liabilities                                              (2,326) ------------------------------------------ --------------------- Total cash and stock paid                               $31,853 ------------------------------------------ ---------------------  The following table reflects  unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of the Company and Kesmai on the basis that the  acquisition  had taken place on April 1, 1998 (in thousands, except per share data):  ---------------------------------- -----------------------------                                       Years Ended March 31,                                              2000          1999 ---------------------------------- --------------- ------------- Net revenues                           $1,421,313    $1,223,444 Net income                             $  113,996    $   64,237 Net income per share - basic           $     0.91    $     0.53 Net income per share - diluted         $     0.86    $     0.51 Number of shares used in computation - basic                       125,660       121,495 Number of shares used in computation - diluted                     132,742       126,545 ---------------------------------- --------------- -------------  In management's  opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations are not  indicative  of the actual  results  that would  have  occurred  had the acquisition  been  consummated  at the  beginning  of  fiscal  1999 or of future operations of the combined  companies  under the ownership and management of the Company.  (c) Westwood Studios  In September 1998, the Company  completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios, Inc.  and  certain  assets  of the  Irvine,  California  - based  Virgin  Studio (collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including transaction expenses.  The adjusted allocation of the excess purchase price over the net  tangible  liabilities  assumed  was  $128,573,000  of  which,  based on management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation consultant,  $41,836,000  was  allocated  to purchased  in-process  research and development and $86,737,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts allocated to other  intangibles  include  franchise  trade names of $32,357,000, existing  technology of $6,510,000,  workforces of $1,680,000 and other goodwill of  $46,190,000  and are being  amortized  over lives ranging from two to twelve years.  Purchased  in-process  research  and  development  includes the value of products  in the  development  stage  that are not  considered  to have  reached technological  feasibility or to have alternative future use. Accordingly,  this non-recurring item was expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations upon consummation  of  the  acquisition.  The  non-recurring  charge  for  in-process research and  development  reduced diluted  earnings per share by  approximately $0.30 in the fiscal year 1999. The results of the operations of Westwood and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities  assumed are included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition.  In conjunction  with the merger of Westwood,  the Company accrued  approximately $1,500,000  related to direct  transaction costs and other related accruals.  At March 31,  2001,  there were  $500,000  in accruals  remaining  related to these items.  In  connection  with the  Westwood  acquisition,  the  purchase  price  has been allocated to the assets and  liabilities  assumed  based upon the fair values on the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands):  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------- Current assets                                           $  4,500 Property and equipment                                      3,257 In-process technology                                      41,836 Other intangible assets                                    86,737 Current liabilities                                       (13,642) ---------------------------------------------- ------------------- Total purchase price                                     $122,688 ---------------------------------------------- -------------------  The following table reflects  unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of the Company and Westwood on the basis that the acquisition had taken place on April 1, 1997 (in thousands, except per share data):  ------------------------------------ ---------------                                                1999 ------------------------------------ --------------- Revenues                                 $1,229,055 Net income                               $  111,308 Net income per share - basic             $     0.92 Net income per share - diluted           $     0.88 Number of shares used in computation - basic                         121,495 Number of shares used in computation - diluted                       126,545 ------------------------------------ ---------------  In management's  opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations are not  indicative  of the actual  results  that would  have  occurred  had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of fiscal 1998 or at the beginning of fiscal  1999 or of future  operations  of the  combined  companies  under the ownership and management of the Company.                                         64 (d) Square Co., Ltd.  In May 1998, the Company and Square Co., Ltd.  ("Square"),  a leading  developer and publisher of entertainment software in Japan, completed the formation of two new joint ventures in North America and Japan.  In North America,  the companies formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which has exclusive publishing rights in North America for future interactive  entertainment  titles created by Square. Additionally, the Company has the exclusive right to distribute in North America  products  published  by this joint  venture.  The  Company  contributed $3,000,000  and owns a 30% minority  interest in this joint venture while Square owns 70%. This joint venture is accounted for under the equity method.  In Japan, the companies established  Electronic Arts Square KK ("EA Square KK"), which will  localize and publish in Japan the  Company's  properties  originally created in North  America  and Europe,  as well as develop and publish  original video  games in  Japan.  The  Company  contributed  cash and has a 70%  majority ownership interest, while Square contributed cash and owns 30%. Accordingly, the assets,  liabilities  and results of operations for EA Square KK are included in the Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets and Results of Operations since June 1, 1998,  the date of formation.  Square's 30% interest in EA Square KK has been reflected as "Minority  interest in consolidated joint venture" on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  (e) Other Business Combinations  Additionally,  during the year ended March 31,  2000,  the Company  acquired two software  development  companies.  In connection  with these  acquisitions,  the Company incurred a charge of $2,670,000 for acquired in-process technology.  The charge was made after the Company  concluded that the in-process  technology had not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software.  (15) INCOME TAXES  The Company's  pretax income (loss) from  operations  for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 consisted of the following components:  ------------------------- ------------- ------------ ------------ (in thousands)                    2001         2000         1999 ------------------------- ------------- ------------ ------------ Domestic                     $(27,166)     $104,096      $79,789 Foreign                        13,736        65,718       38,669 ------------------------- ------------- ------------ ------------ Total pretax income (loss)                       $(13,430)     $169,814     $118,458 ------------------------- ------------- ------------ ------------  Income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 consisted of:  ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------ (in thousands)                    Current     Deferred        Total ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------  2001:    Federal                        $(4,233)   $(19,975)    $ (24,208)    State                              582     (13,809)      (13,227)    Foreign                          6,981         541         7,522    Charge in lieu of taxes      from employee stock      plans for Class A             25,750           -        25,750 ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------                                   $29,080    $(33,243)    $  (4,163) ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------  2000:    Federal                        $ 2,766    $  3,231     $   5,997    State                              299         859         1,158    Foreign                         15,573      (2,649)       12,924    Charge in lieu of taxes      from employee stock      plans                         32,563           -        32,563 ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------                                   $51,201    $  1,441     $  52,642 ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------     1999:    Federal                        $31,204    $(10,340)    $  20,864    State                            4,401      (2,590)        1,811    Foreign                         15,715       1,410        17,125    Charge in lieu of taxes      from employee stock      plans                          5,614           -         5,614 ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------                                   $56,934    $(11,520)    $  45,414 ------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------  The  components  of the net  deferred  tax assets as of March 31,  2001 and 2000 consist of:  ---------------------------------------- ------------- -------------- (in thousands)                                   2001          2000 ---------------------------------------- ------------- -------------- Deferred tax assets:   Accruals, reserves and other expenses      $110,331       $70,131 ---------------------------------------- ------------- --------------       Total                                   110,331        70,131 ---------------------------------------- ------------- --------------  Deferred tax liabilities:   Undistributed earnings of DISC               (1,189)       (1,487)   Prepaid royalty expenses                    (44,678)      (38,562)   Fixed assets                                 (4,456)       (3,249)   Unrealized gains on marketable    securities                                       -           (68) ---------------------------------------- ------------- --------------       Total                                   (50,323)      (43,366) ---------------------------------------- ------------- --------------       Net deferred tax asset                 $ 60,008       $26,765 ---------------------------------------- ------------- --------------  At March 31,  2001,  deferred  tax assets of  $57,082,000  and  $2,926,000  were included in other current assets and other assets, respectively.                                         65 At March 31, 2001, the Company had net Federal  operating loss  carryforwards of approximately  $19,000,000  for income tax reporting  purposes,  which expire in 2021.  The  Company  also  has  research  and  experimental  tax  credits   aggregating approximately  $15,000,000 and $11,000,000 for federal and California  purposes, respectively.  The federal credit  carryforwards  expire in 2021. The California credits carry over indefinitely until utilized.  The  differences  between  the  statutory  income  tax  rate  and the  Company's effective tax rate,  expressed as a percentage  of income  before  provision for income taxes, for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows:  ------------------------------------ ---------- --------- --------                                           2001      2000      1999 ------------------------------------ ---------- --------- -------- Statutory Federal tax rate              (35.0%)    35.0%    35.0% State taxes, net of Federal benefit                                         (10.0%)     1.5%     1.5% Differences between statutory rate    and foreign effective tax rate                                          20.2%     (2.8%)   (2.5%) Research and development credits                                          (4.7%)    (1.7%)   (2.1%) Nondeductible acquisition costs           0.0%      0.0%     7.4% Other                                    (1.5%)    (1.0%)   (1.0%) ------------------------------------ ---------- --------- --------                                         (31.0%)    31.0%    38.3% ------------------------------------ ---------- --------- --------  The  Company  provides  for  U.S.  taxes  on an  insignificant  portion  of  the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and does not provide taxes on the  remainder.  The  Company  has  not  provided  for  Federal  income  tax  on approximately   $170,000,000   of   undistributed   earnings   of  its   foreign subsidiaries,  since the  Company  intends to  reinvest  this  amount in foreign subsidiary operations indefinitely.  At March 31,  2001,  the  Company  believes  it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate  sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets.  The Company's U.S.  income tax returns for the years 1992 through 1995 have been examined by the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS). In 1998, the Company received a notice of  deficiencies  from the IRS. These  deficiencies  relate  primarily to operations in Puerto Rico,  which the Company is  contesting  in Tax Court.  The Company  believes that any additional  liabilities,  if any, that arise from the outcome of this examination  will not be material to the Company's  consolidated financial statements.

Long-term investments, investments classified as held-to-maturity and marketable securities - fair value is based on quoted market prices.  (19) SEGMENT INFORMATION  SFAS 131 establishes  standards for the reporting by public business enterprises of information  about product lines,  geographic areas and major customers.  The method  for  determining  what  information  to  report is based on the way that management  organizes  the  operating  segments  within the  Company  for making operational  decisions and assessments of financial  performance.  The Company's chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Company's Chief Executive Officer  ("CEO").  The  CEO  reviews  financial   information   presented  on  a consolidated  basis  accompanied by disaggregated  information about revenues by geographic  region  and by  product  lines  for  purposes  of  making  operating decisions and assessing financial performance.  As a result  of the  issuance  of Class B common  stock,  which is  intended  to reflect the performance of EA.com,  management considers EA.com to be a separate reportable segment.  Accordingly,  prior period information has been restated to disclose  separate  segments.  The Company  operates in two  principal  business segments globally:   o       Electronic Arts core ("EA Core") business segment: creation,  marketing          and distribution of entertainment software.   o       EA.com  business  segment:  creation,  marketing  and  distribution  of          entertainment  software  which can be played  or sold  online,  ongoing          management of subscriptions of online games and website advertising.  Please see the discussion regarding segment reporting in the MD&A.                                         67 Information  about Electronic Arts business  segments is presented below for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (in thousands): ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                           Year Ended March 31, 2001                                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              EA Core                 Adjustments and                                                       (excl.
