Documents From Which Information is Incorporated By Reference: Proxy Statement and 2002 Annual Financial and General Information Report for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May16, 2003 (PartIII) PART I Item 1. Business.
The Registrant is a holding company whose operating subsidiaries carry on business in three distinct operating segments: (i)insurance brokerage and other services; (ii)consulting; and (iii)insurance underwriting. Incorporated in 1979, it is the parent corporation of long-established and more recently formed companies.
The Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment consists principally of Aon's retail, reinsurance and wholesale brokerage, as well as related insurance services, including claims services, underwriting management, captive insurance company management services and premium financing. These services are provided by certain indirect subsidiaries of the Registrant, including: Aon Risk Services Companies,Inc.; Aon Holdings International bv; Aon Services Group,Inc.; Aon Re Worldwide,Inc.; Aon Limited (U.K.); and Cananwill,Inc., which are subsidiaries of Aon Group,Inc. (Aon Group).
The Consulting segment provides a full range of human capital management services utilizing five practices: employee benefits; compensation; management consulting; outsourcing; and communications. These services are provided primarily by subsidiaries and affiliates of Aon Consulting Worldwide,Inc., which is also a subsidiary of Aon Group.
Aon's Insurance Underwriting segment is comprised of supplemental accident and health and life insurance and extended warranty and casualty insurance products and services. Combined Insurance Company of America ("Combined Insurance") engages in the marketing and underwriting of accident and health and life insurance products. Combined Specialty Insurance Company (formerly known as Virginia Surety Company,Inc.) and London General Insurance Company Limited offer extended warranty and casualty insurance products and services.
In November2000, the Registrant announced a business transformation plan, which began in fourth quarter 2000 and was completed in 2002. The transformation plan affected each operating segment; however, most changes affected the largest operating segment, Insurance Brokerage and Other Services, and occurred in the major countries of operation, the U.S. and the United Kingdom.
In April2001, the Registrant announced a plan to spin off its insurance underwriting businesses to Aon's common stockholders, to create two independent, publicly-traded companies. In August2002, the Company announced that it was no longer planning to spin off all of the underwriting businesses, but was considering a sale or partial spin-off. At that time, a sale of all or part of the underwriting operations, at an acceptable price, was believed to be achievable within a reasonable timeframe, especially given unsolicited buying interest in the past. While the Registrant received indications of interest in the underwriting businesses, none were in an acceptable price range due to the unfavorable mergers and acquisitions environment resulting from volatile capital markets. Proceeds from a sale of such businesses would have allowed Aon to pay down short-term debt, but would have resulted in unacceptable earnings dilution. A spin-off of part of the underwriting operations was determined to be impractical due to capital requirements. Therefore, on October31, 2002, the Registrant announced that it had decided not to sell, or spin off, its major underwriting subsidiaries. In fourth quarter 2002, the Registrant announced its plans to sell Sheffield Insurance Corporation, a small property-casualty company, which was completed in first quarter 2003. In February2003, the Registrant announced that it would be discontinuing its accident and health insurance underwriting operations in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, as well as its large company group life business in the U.S. The Registrant will pursue a "back to basics" strategy in the accident and health insurance business, where the focus will be on core products and regions with the best returns on investments.
During 2002, the Registrant incurred approximately $50million of expenses related to the planned divestiture of its insurance underwriting businesses which included costs related to the expanded 2 corporate and underwriting staff that was added in contemplation of the divestiture. These costs, recorded primarily in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income, represent staff buildup and severance costs, corporate overhead and advisory fees and other costs tied to the specialty property and casualty underwriting initiatives which will not be pursued.
In November2002, the Registrant completed a public offering of 36.8million shares of its common stock, raising net proceeds of approximately $607million. The offering was made pursuant to an existing shelf registration statement. Also in November2002, the Registrant completed a separate private offering of $300million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior convertible debentures due 2012. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $296million. The debentures are unsecured obligations and, under certain circumstances, are convertible into common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $21.475 per common share. The debentures were sold to qualified institutional buyers. In January2003, the Registrant filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the resale of the debentures. In December2002, the Registrant completed a private offering of $225million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior notes due 2012. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $223million. The notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers. The Registrant used the net proceeds from these offerings to repay outstanding commercial paper and other short-term debt, to partially repurchase certain debt securities that were due in 2003 and 2004 and to repurchase $98million of the Registrant's 8.205% Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities. In January2003, a portion of the remaining funds were utilized to repay $150million of maturing LIBOR+1% debt securities.
The Registrant hereby incorporates by reference note5, "Business Transformation Plan," and note16, "Segment Information," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in PartII, Item 8 of this report, as well as information under the heading "Review by Segments" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in PartII, Item 7 of this report.
Competition and Industry Position (1)Insurance Brokerage and Other Services Aon Group,Inc.; Aon Risk Services Companies,Inc.; Aon Limited (U.K.); Aon Holdings International bv; Aon Services Group,Inc.; Aon Re Worldwide,Inc.; Cananwill, Inc; and Premier Auto Finance,Inc.
These companies conduct the Registrant's brokerage and consulting operations, and have approximately 600 offices around the world in more than 125 countries and sovereignties. In 2002, those companies employed over 44,000 professionals and support personnel to serve the diverse needs of clients.
Our retail brokerage companies operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with a large number of retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as individual brokers and agents and direct writers of insurance coverage. The companies provide a broad spectrum of advisory and outsourcing services including risk identification and assessment, alternative risk financing, safety engineering, loss management and program administration for clients. They also design, place and implement customized insurance products. They have also developed certain specialist areas such as marine, aviation, directors' and officers' and professional liability, financial institutions, construction, energy, media, healthcare and entertainment. In 2002, investments were made in professional talent, technology, process improvement and the development of specialized products and services to meet the evolving needs of clients. These companies operate through offices located in North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Australia and Asia/Pacific.
3 The companies address the highly specialized product development, consulting and administrative risk management needs of professional groups, service businesses, governments, healthcare providers and commercial organizations. They also provide underwriting management skills, claims and risk management expertise and third-party administration services to insurance companies, and insurance brokerage services for individuals. They market and broker both the primary and reinsurance risks of these programs. For individuals, associations and businesses, affinity products are brokered for professional liability, life, disability income and personal lines.
Aon's reinsurance brokerage activities are organized primarily under Aon Re in the U.S. and Aon Limited in the United Kingdom, constituting the largest reinsurance broker in the world and offering sophisticated advisory services in program design that enhance the risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios and improve capital utilization, along with the evaluation of catastrophic loss exposures.
Premium-related financing services are available to clients of Aon and other independent organizations through Cananwill. Certain retail automotive organizations have also been provided a service which purchases a select amount of their auto financing and leasing contracts from individuals and sells them to unaffiliated parties through companies associated with Premier Auto Finance,Inc., a subsidiary of Aon Group,Inc., which then continue the management of collections on the contracts and provide other related services. After March2001, companies associated with Premier Auto Finance ceased purchasing and securitizing new automobile installment contracts, but continue to service the existing portfolio, which is in run-off.
(2)Consulting Aon Consulting Worldwide,Inc.
Aon Consulting Worldwide,Inc., is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. The operations of this segment provide a full range of human capital management services that serve three major client segmentslarge corporations, middle market companies and small firms.
Around the world, companies have to find advanced ways to attract and retain workers with the right skill levels and commitments. Aon Consulting, with its expertise in employee benefits, compensation, management consulting, outsourcing and communication, and its access to the Registrant's other subsidiaries, is well-positioned to serve this market. Aon Consulting subsidiaries offer services including construction and implementation of benefit packages, proprietary research on employee commitment and loyalty; compensation design; assistance in process improvement and design, leadership, organization and human capital development; employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration and other employment services; and advice to companies on initiatives to support their corporate vision.
The acquisitions of ASI Solutions,Inc. and Actuarial Sciences Associates,Inc. expanded the Registrant's ability to provide outsourcing services to a broad spectrum of large corporate clients. In third quarter 2002, Aon entered into a sizeable new outsourcing contract that is expected to provide favorable returns over the life of the multi-year agreement. The recognition of revenues and expenses, however, will significantly influence financial results over the contract period. Revenues are recorded on a gross basis, inclusive of amounts ultimately passed through to subcontractors, and are recorded ratably over the life of the contract. Also, up-front investment costs to support the new business cause pretax margins to be significantly lower in the early years of the multi-year contract, compared with the later years when margins increase. A significant portion of the up-front investment costs incurred for the new outsourcing contracts can be leveraged to handle increased business volume.
4 (3)Insurance Underwriting Combined Insurance Company of America; Combined Life Insurance Company of New York ("CLICNY"); Combined Specialty Insurance Company ("CSIC"); London General Insurance Company Limited; Sterling Life Insurance Company; and Aon Warranty Group,Inc..
The Registrant's insurance underwriting subsidiaries are part of a highly competitive industry that serves individual consumers in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia/Pacific by providing accident and health coverage, traditional life insurance and extended warranty and casualty insurance products and services through distribution networks, most of which are directly owned by the Registrant's subsidiaries.
The supplemental accident and health and life distribution network encompasses primarily the agents of Combined Insurance and CLICNY (which operates exclusively in the State of New York). Combined Insurance, the Registrant's principal accident and health and life insurer, has a sales force of 7,500 career agents calling on individuals to sell a broad spectrum of low premium, low limit accident and health products. In addition, it has developed relationships with select brokers and consultants to reach specific niche markets. Combined Insurance offers a wide range of accident, sickness, short-term disability and other supplemental insurance products including a simplified accident and sickness long-term disability policy. Most of Combined Insurance's products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations, thereby not subject to escalating medical costs. In recent years, Combined Insurance expanded its product distribution to include direct response programs, affinity groups and worksite marketing, creating access to new markets and potential new policyholders. We also specialize in healthcare plans for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare supplement insurance covers expenses not covered by Medicare such as deductibles and co-payments. In 2000, we became the first private insurer to contract with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for a Medicare Plus Choice Private Fee for Service Plan. Combined Insurance's business is conducted in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. However, in early 2003, Combined Insurance announced that it will discontinue its accident and health insurance underwriting businesses in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, as well as its large company group life business.
The Registrant's extended warranty and casualty insurance business, conducted by CSIC, its branches and subsidiaries in North America, South America and Asia/Pacific and London General in Europe, provides warranties on automobiles and a variety of consumer goods, including electronics and appliances. In addition, these subsidiaries provide non-structural home warranties and other warranty products, such as credit card enhancements and affinity warranty programs. CSIC and London General are among the world's largest underwriters of consumer extended warranties. The extended warranty products are sold in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. The administration of certain warranty services on automobiles, electronic goods, personal computers and appliances is handled by certain operations in the Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment.
In 2001, the Registrant's underwriting business invested $227million to obtain an ownership interest in Endurance Specialty Insurance,Ltd., which offers property and casualty insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis. The investment will help provide much needed underwriting capacity to commercial firms and insurance and reinsurance customers.
(4)Discontinued Operations The Registrant hereby incorporates by reference note6, "Discontinued Operations," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in PartII, Item 8 of this report.
5 Licensing and Regulation Regulatory authorities in the states or countries in which the operating subsidiaries of Aon Group conduct business may require individual or company licensing to act as brokers, agents, third party administrators, managing general agents, reinsurance intermediaries or adjusters. Under the laws of most states in the U.S. and of most foreign countries, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting, renewing and revoking brokers' and agents' licenses to transact business in the state or country. The manner of operating in particular states and countries may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular state or country, which may require, among other things, that a firm operate in the state or country through a local corporation. In a few states and countries, licenses are issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities. In such cases, Aon Group subsidiaries have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the state or country.
Insurance companies must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are designed to ensure financial solvency of insurance companies and to require fair and adequate service and treatment for policyholders. They are enforced by the states in the U.S., by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, and by various regulatory agencies in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business, licensing of agents, monitoring of trade practices, policy form approval, minimum loss ratio requirements, limits on premium and commission rates, and minimum reserve and capital requirements. Compliance is monitored by the state insurance departments through periodic regulatory reporting procedures and periodic examinations. The quarterly and annual financial reports to the regulators in the U.S. utilize statutory accounting principles which are different from accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The statutory accounting principles, in keeping with the intent to assure the protection of policyholders are based, in general, on a liquidation concept, while accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. are based on a going-concern concept.
The state insurance regulators are members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The NAIC seeks to promote uniformity of, and to enhance the state regulation of, insurance. Both the NAIC and the individual states continue to focus on the solvency of insurance companies and their conduct in the marketplace. This focus is reflected in additional regulatory oversight by the states and emphasis on the enactment or adoption of a series of NAIC model laws and regulations designed to promote solvency. Effective January1, 2001, the NAIC revised its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual in a process referred to as Codification. The domiciliary states of Aon's major insurance subsidiaries have adopted the provisions of the revised manual. The revised manual has changed, to some extent, prescribed statutory accounting practices and resulted in changes to the accounting practices that Aon's major insurance subsidiaries use to prepare their statutory-basis financial statements.
Several years ago, the NAIC developed a formula for analyzing insurers called risk-based capital ("RBC"). RBC is intended to establish "minimum" capital threshold levels that vary with the size and mix of a company's business. It is designed to identify companies with capital levels that may require regulatory attention.
The state insurance holding company laws require prior notice to and approval of the domestic state insurance department of certain intracorporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure, including the payment of dividends by insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, the premium finance loans by Cananwill, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant, are subject to one or more of truth-in-lending and credit regulations, insurance premium finance acts, retail installment sales acts and other similar consumer protection legislation. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can result in the temporary suspension or permanent loss of the right to engage in business in a particular jurisdiction as well as other penalties.
6 Recent federal and state laws and proposals mandating specific practices by medical insurers and the health care industry will not, because of the nature of the business of the Registrant's subsidiaries, materially affect the Registrant. Numerous states have had legislation introduced to reform the health care system, and such legislation has passed in several states. While it is impossible to forecast the precise nature of future federal and state health care changes, because most of the policies issued by the Registrant's insurance subsidiaries are supplemental in nature and provide, on a fixed-indemnity basis, protection against loss-of-time or disability benefits, the Registrant does not expect such legislation to have a material impact on its operations. Congress has passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as S 900 or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. While S 900 makes substantial changes in allowing financial organizations to diversify, the Registrant does not believe its enactment will have a material effect on the business of its insurance subsidiaries.
Clientele No significant part of the Registrant's or its subsidiaries' business is dependent upon a single client or on a few clients, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the Registrant or its operating segments.
Employees At December31, 2002, the Registrant had approximately 55,000 employees, of whom approximately 51,000 are salaried and hourly employees and the remaining 4,000 are career agents who are generally compensated wholly or primarily by commission. In addition, there were approximately 3,500 international career agents who are considered independent contractors and are not employees of the Registrant. Of the total number of employees, 26,000 work in the U.S.
Website Access to Reports The Registrant's annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the Registrant's website (http://www.aon.com) as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 2. Properties.
The business activities of the Registrant and its subsidiaries are conducted principally in leased office space in cities throughout the world. The Registrant's subsidiaries do own and occupy office buildings in five states and certain foreign countries. In general, no difficulty is anticipated in negotiating renewals as leases expire or in finding other satisfactory space if the premises become unavailable. In certain circumstances, the Registrant may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
The Registrant hereby incorporates by reference note15, "Contingencies," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in PartII, Item 8 of this report.

10 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview This Management's Discussion and Analysis is divided into seven sections. In the first section, "Key Recent Events," we describe five items that significantly affected our results of operations and our financial condition during the periods covered by the financial statements included in this report. In the second section, "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," we discuss certain accounting judgments that are important to understanding our financial statements. With the information from those first two sections providing important background, we then proceed with the sections providing year-to-year comparisons of our results on a consolidated basis and on a segment basis. These sections are designated by the captions "Review of Consolidated Results" and "Review by Segments," respectively. "Financial Condition and Liquidity," covers several items including disclosures related to the statement of financial position and information on special purpose entities. The "Risks and Outlook" section addresses the issues and factors that can influence future results. The final section, "Recent Developments," covers items that have occurred since February12, 2003.
More specifically, this Management's Discussion and Analysis is organized using the following outline: KEY RECENT EVENTS Business Transformation Plan World Trade Center Tragedy Previously Planned Divestiture of Insurance Underwriting Businesses and Discontinuance of Certain Operations SEC Comment Letter (Division of Corporation Finance) Capital Enhancement Actions CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Pensions Contingencies Policy Liabilities REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS General Financial Overview of 2002 Summary Results for 2000 through 2002 Consolidated Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Consolidated Results for Fourth Quarter 2002 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2001 Consolidated Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 REVIEW BY SEGMENT General Insurance Brokerage and Other Services Consulting Insurance Underwriting Corporate and Other Discontinued Operations FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Liquidity Financial Condition 11 Capital Resources Special Purpose Entities Investments RISKS AND OUTLOOK Risks Related to Our Business and the Insurance Industry Information Concerning Forward-looking Statements RECENT DEVELOPMENTS KEY RECENT EVENTS Business Transformation Plan In fourth quarter 2000, after final approval by its Board of Directors, Aon began a comprehensive business transformation plan designed to:  enhance client service  improve productivity through process redesign  accelerate revenue growth.
Most plan costs relate to the Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment, principally in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, where most of our offices and employees are located.
Status of business transformation plan implementation We have implemented the business transformation plan, which has delivered many, but not all of the expected benefits. In U.S. retail brokerage, the plan entailed extensive process redesign following the rollout of a new policy management and accounting system (completed in 2000), and substantial job redesign based on functional expertise and the creation of four new client service centers. There were delays, revenue disruptions and expense additions in this area.
The unexpected delays in implementing some aspects of the plan were due to:  challenges in handling higher volumes of information transfers between field operations and the service centers  the destruction of our largest and most advanced service center in the World Trade Center.
These delays negatively impacted new business production, as our attention was diverted from generating new accounts to completing client conversions and maintaining service to our New York region clients from our offices throughout the U.S.
In addition, expenses were higher than expected, due in part to:  additional temporary employee expense necessary to complete the account conversions to the service centers  increased compensation for certain brokerage employees  the hiring of employees with specialized skills.
In addition, in the aftermath of the World Trade Center tragedy, the dynamics of the insurance marketplace have changed, increasing time requirements and expense for handling certain job functions.
12 The table below summarizes our business transformation costs by calendar year and provides a breakdown of pretax expenses.
2002 2001 2000 Plan Total (millions except per share and employee data) Business Transformation Costs Pretax expense (credit) $ (6 ) $ 218 $ 82 $ 294 After-tax expense (credit) (4 ) 133 50 179 Dilutive earnings per share loss (credit) (0.01 ) 0.49 0.19 0.67 Pretax Expense (Credit) by Type: Termination Benefits $ (6 ) $ 109 $ 54 $ 157 Approximate No. of employees(1) (200 ) 3,150 750 3,700 Exit Costs, Impairments and Other Expenses  109 28 137 Abandoned real estate or equipment losses  10 2 12 Impairment of fixed assets  10 20 30 Obligations related to automobile dealer partnerships  44  44 Exit of certain joint venture operations  12  12 Litigation matters and discontinuance of A&H business in one state  14  14 Commission receivable write-off  5  5 Direct costs to complete transformation and cash settlements  11 4 15 Other costs  3 2 5 Total pretax expense (credit) $ (6 ) $ 218 $ 82 $ 294 (1) The approximate number of employees shown is on a gross basis, based upon notice of termination. Given effect to approximately 900 new hires, the expected ultimate net reduction will be approximately 2,800 in the units affected by the business transformation plan.
The $294million plan total excludes:  transition costs primarily relating to parallel system processing and temporary employee expense. These transition costs, primarily in the U.S., amounted to $30million in 2001 and $10million in 2002  increased compensation for certain U.S. retail brokerage employees comprised of increased base salaries and one-time special incentive compensation  the hiring of employees with specialized skills In recording these expenses, we followed the accounting guidance from Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 94-3, Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 100, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.121, and FASB Statement No.5. In each year that we recorded accruals for either termination benefits or other costs to exit an activity, we met all of the requirements contained in EITF 94-3 and SAB 100 before recording an accrual, although our Board approved the high-level plan in the fall of 2000.
We incurred these expenses over two years because different Aon units completed detailed plans and satisfied the employee notification requirements in different timeframes. The expenses for our U.S. retail brokerage operation were approximately 19% of the plan total costs. We do not anticipate any additional expenses from the business transformation plan.
13 Termination benefits We incurred expenses totaling $54million in 2000 and $109million in 2001 for termination benefits, covering the costs to sever approximately 750 employees in 2000 and 3,150 employees in 2001. Approximately 200 of the notified employees were to have their jobs terminated under a U.S. retail brokerage exit plan; however, the tragic events of September11 th have reduced the total number of employees who will be terminated. As a result, we recorded a $6million credit in general expenses in 2002. A portion of the overall employment reduction was expected to be accomplished through normal attrition and, therefore, no expense was attributable to those reductions. Therefore, the approximate number of employees to be terminated was 3,700. Giving effect to approximately 900 new hires, the expected ultimate net reduction of employees will be approximately 2,800 in the units affected by the business transformation plan.
Almost all of the affected employees had been removed from the payroll as of December31, 2002. All of the 198 remaining notified, but not yet terminated, employees work outside the U.S.; the exit plans for these employees have later termination dates because employment laws in certain countries require extended periods before we can terminate a notified employee. Our exit plans in these cases were targeted to specific employee groups, and in some cases, specific employees.
At or before the expense accrual date, we properly notified these employee groups and gave them adequate information about their severance benefits. The run-off of the associated liability will trail the time by which we complete these exit plans because our policy is to pay severance over the eligible period, rather than in a lump sum amount, whenever possible.
Costs to exit activities Approximately $27million in other costs to exit an activity have also been included in the total expense of $294million. Of that amount, we incurred $6million in 2000, which included $2million in abandoned real estate or equipment leases and $4million of direct costs necessary to complete portions of the business transformation plan and cash settlements necessary to exit contractual obligations. In 2001, we recorded $21million of expenses, which included $10million for abandoned leases and $11million for direct costs necessary to complete portions of the business transformation plan and cash settlements necessary to exit contractual obligations.
Other costs As part of our business transformation and other strategic initiatives, we incurred other expenses of $110million. Of this total, $22million was recorded in 2000. Impairment of fixed assets accounted for $20million of the 2000 expense, including $16million for information systems assets. The net book value of these assets was written off, as these assets no longer had value to Aon. The assets were considered impaired and without value because of one of the following reasons: 1.
We removed the system from service.
2.
We abandoned system development as a result of the transformation.
3.
We outsourced the relevant function for some fixed assets, including certain technology infrastructure equipment.
There were $2million of other costs also recognized in 2000.
We recorded $88million as other expenses in 2001. More specifically, Aon has acted as a servicing agent for a limited partnership affiliated with our automobile dealership clients to provide auto financing to dealerships on a cooperative basis through various financing conduit facilities. We also have a general partnership interest in the limited partnership. Our primary client relationship with automobile dealers is to provide extended warranty products to their customers.
14 In first quarter 2001, we elected to cease servicing new business and run off our existing service obligation, given competition from financing provided by the financing arms of automobile manufacturers. The limited partnership records allowances for uncollectible loan balances.
In conjunction with our decision to discontinue new auto financing receivables, the limited partners are not obligated to contribute additional capital beyond what they have already provided for any shortfall in the reserves for their individual book of business. We are required to fund any shortfalls in accordance with our limited recourse to the funding facility, arranged by the servicing agent.
The servicing agent estimated an expense of $44million as our liability for the shortfall when we decided to discontinue new auto loan financing under the facility. We recorded a charge to establish this obligation in accordance with FASB Statement No.5 in 2001. For the year 2000, the last full year of normal operation, these servicing operations, which were part of our Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment, generated revenue of $42million and pretax income of $3million.
During 2001, we exited four other joint venture operations as a part of our business transformation process. For the year 2000, the last full year of operation, these joint ventures, which were part of our Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment, generated less than $1million of revenue and nearly $3million of pretax losses. The total cost to exit these four joint ventures was $12million.
Additional expenses in 2001 included:  $14million for discontinuing supplemental accident and health insurance business operations in Mississippi. The charge included severance costs and expenses associated reassigning agents and estimated costs for resolving asserted and unasserted claims and suits.
a $5million expense relating to the write-down of certain agent receivables in conjunction with restructuring a worksite marketing agent commission pay structure and operations.
In 2001, we also incurred additional fixed asset impairments of $10million (of which $9million related to information systems assets) and $3million of other costs.
The implementation and effects of the business transformation plan must be viewed in the context of the World Trade Center tragedy.
World Trade Center Tragedy The attack on the World Trade Center significantly impacted our employees, our clients and industry, our business transformation plan and our financial results.
Employee Impact  This terrorist attack destroyed our largest and most advanced U.S. retail brokerage service center. This service center was an important element of the business transformation and had been built and staffed just months before; we had to rebuild this service center in Manhattan while rerouting client work to the remaining three service centers in the U.S.
1,100 of our employees worked in the World Trade Center, including employees from all of our major businesses  175 of our employees died in the World Trade Center attack on September11, 2001  250 additional employees from around the world either worked in other lower Manhattan offices or were visiting the World Trade Center on September11 th , which demonstrates the significance of this office to our global operations  Displaced World Trade Center employees had to be relocated to other New York City metropolitan offices 15  We had to refer regular client servicing to other company offices for varying periods until employees had proper temporary work facilities Client and Industry Impact  The September11 th attacks thrust the insurance industry into the most tumultuous period in its recent history  Client demand for risk management advice and services has grown dramatically since September11 th  Premium rates have accelerated to their highest levels in decades  Insurance capacity has been restricted and policy coverage has tightened  Workloads for insurance brokers to complete similar tasks have significantly increased  Competitive demand for risk management professionals has risen along with compensation requirements.
Business Transformation Plan Impact The insurance brokerage industry worldwide has expanded significantly since September11 th with increased client demand for risk management services not anticipated when we first developed the business transformation. This unanticipated expansion delayed our ability to implement some parts of the plan. It also required that we incur additional spending, primarily in the U.S., to take advantage of this industry expansion, which partially explains the offset in savings.
Financial Results Impact In 2001, Aon recorded pretax unusual charges of $158million, net of insurance and reinsurance reimbursements, related to losses sustained as a result of the destruction of the World Trade Center and the death of 175 employees. The financial costs we incurred for this tragedy included $192million of insurance benefits paid by Aon's Combined Insurance Company of America subsidiary (CICA) under life insurance policies issued for the benefit of deceased employees, a cost which is partially offset by anticipated reinsurance reimbursements of $147million, resulting in a net charge of $45million.
Reinsurers have disputed their liability for about $90million of reinsurance reimbursements under a Business Travel Accident (BTA) policy issued by CICA to cover U.S.-based employees of subsidiaries of Aon; both parties have filed legal actions. We recorded a pretax $90million allowance for a potentially uncollectible receivable related to this dispute in fourth quarter 2001.
In September2002, the Court dismissed CICA's action with respect to the BTA policy for the lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Prior to year-end, CICA was granted an expedited appeal.
Other World Trade Center charges also included:  $33million of destroyed depreciable assets at net book value  $40million for salaries and benefits for deceased and injured employees and other costs  a $10million commitment to the Aon Memorial Education fund to support the educational needs of the children of Aon employees who were victims of the September11th attacks.
Offsetting these expenses were estimated reimbursements of $60million.
We reached a settlement with our property insurance carriers in 2002 pertaining to reimbursement for depreciable assets destroyed. This settlement resulted in a pretax credit of $29million which is 16 reported as an Unusual creditWorld Trade Center in the consolidated statements of income. Aon continues to present additional claims to insurers for losses related to extra expenses, leasehold interests and business interruption coverage, and we expect additional recoveries and gains when specific claims are settled.
Previously Planned Divestiture of Insurance Underwriting Businesses and Discontinuance of Certain Operations As disclosed in April2001, Aon's Board of Directors approved a preliminary plan to spin off its insurance underwriting businesses to Aon's common stockholders, creating two independent, publicly traded companies.
When we reported our second quarter 2002 results, we announced that we were no longer planning to spin off all of our underwriting operations, but were continuing to consider either selling or partially spinning them off. At that time, we believed we could promptly sell all or part of the underwriting operations at an acceptable price within a reasonable time given unsolicited buying interest in the past.
We decided not to pursue this revised plan in October2002 for these reasons: 1.
While we received indications of interest in our underwriting businesses, none reflected an acceptable price due to the unfavorable mergers and acquisitions environment resulting from volatile capital markets. Although proceeds from selling such businesses would have allowed us to pay down short-term debt, the sale would have resulted in unacceptable earnings dilution.
2.
We determined that spinning off part of our underwriting operations was impractical due to capital requirements and possible rating agency reactions.
During 2002, Aon incurred $50million of pretax expenses related to the planned divestiture of our insurance underwriting businesses, which included costs related to the expanded corporate and underwriting staff added in anticipation of the divestiture. These costs, of which $33million are reflected in our Insurance Underwriting segment results and $17million are reflected in our Corporate and Other segment, are recorded primarily in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income, and represent staff buildup and severance costs, corporate overhead and advisory fees and other costs tied to the specialty property and casualty underwriting initiatives.
In fourth quarter 2002, Aon announced its plans to sell Sheffield Insurance Corporation, a small property-casualty company.
In February2003, we announced that we would be discontinuing our accident and health insurance underwriting operations in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, as well as our large company group life business in the U.S. Total premiums earned in 2002, related to these lines of businesses, were approximately $100million. We will pursue a "back to basics" strategy in the accident and health insurance business, where the focus will be on core products and regions with the best returns on investments.
SEC Comment Letter (Division of Corporation Finance) In July2002, we received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance regarding our 2001 Form10-K and first quarter 2002 Form10-Q. The SEC sent this letter as part of its publicly announced plan to review periodic reports of large public corporations. Aggregate stockholders' equity was not impacted as a result of our resolution of issues with the SEC.
17 The SEC letter asked questions pertaining to three main areas: 1.
A $90million disputed reinsurance recoverable initially recorded in the third quarter 2001 relating to benefits paid to beneficiaries of Aon's World Trade Center employees through our CICA subsidiary that underwrote the insurance coverage. Originally, we had recorded an allowance for potential uncollectibility of the reinsurance recoverable in the first quarter 2002 based on a dispute with reinsurers and certain court actions in an unrelated case. The SEC commented on the timing of the establishment of the allowance.
To resolve this comment, we agreed to establish the allowance in the fourth quarter 2001 and to reverse the amount originally recorded in first quarter 2002.
Consequently, we restated our consolidated financial statements, including relevant schedules and exhibits, for the affected periods and filed them in an amended Form10-K/A for the year ended December31, 2001 and an amended Form10-Q/A for the quarter ended March31, 2002.
2.
The investment portfolio of our subsidiaries.
We have always had a policy of reviewing the investment portfolio of our subsidiaries for potential impairments. The SEC staff believed that with respect to equity and certain below investment grade fixed-maturity securities that had been trading below cost for an extended period of time, we should recognize other than temporary impairments through our income statement more quickly.
We agreed to modify our policy prospectively (see note1 to the consolidated financial statements), and we recognized a cumulative adjustment for other than temporary impairment loss of $56million pretax in second quarter 2002. Approximately $51million of that cumulative adjustment pertained to years before 2002 and $5million applied to first quarter 2002. The SEC staff reviewed this matter and did not object to our conclusions regarding the accounting treatment for the other than temporary impairment adjustments recorded by us in second quarter 2002 that had no effect on our stockholders' equity, total assets, or total liabilities.
3.
The addition or exclusion of certain disclosures and items.
The SEC staff requested that Aon add certain disclosures and not report certain items. To respond to this request, we amended our consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2001 Form10-K/A and first quarter 2002 Form10-Q/A.
Capital Enhancement Actions During the fourth quarter 2002, Aon raised net proceeds of approximately $519million through the issuance of 3.5% convertible debt securities and 7.375% debt securities, and approximately $607million by issuing 36.8million shares of new common stock. The 3.5% debt securities are convertible into Aon common stock at an initial price of approximately $21.475 per common share under certain circumstances (see note8 to the consolidated financial statements). Funds received by these offerings were used to pay down commercial paper, other short-term debt, long-term debt and to repurchase a portion of our trust preferred capital securities. See Capital Resources, below, for further information.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Aon's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). To prepare these financial statements, we made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities and what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
18 In accordance with our policies, we:  continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, policy liabilities (including future policy benefit reserves, unearned premium reserves and policy and contract claim reserves), restructuring costs, retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation  base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances; the results allow us to make judgments about our carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results we report may differ from these estimates if our assumptions or conditions change.
We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements.
Pensions We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with FASB Statement No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. A substantial portion of Aon's pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
There are several assumptions which impact the actuarial calculation of pension plan obligations and, in turn, net periodic pension expense in accordance with FASB Statement No.87. These assumptions require various degrees of judgment. The most significant assumptions are (1)the expected return on plan assets and (2)the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on our current and future consolidated results of operations and financial position.
We estimate the expected return on plan assets at the annual measurement date for each plan using historical analyses of the returns of specific asset classes weighted by the asset allocation of the plan in question. This estimate involves significant judgment with respect to interpretation of these historical analyses as a predictor of future results. In accordance with FASB Statement No.87, the difference between actual and expected earnings for the year is deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense over several years depending on the magnitude of the amount along with other deferred gains and losses (see below). A deterioration in worldwide global equity markets in recent years has caused us to revise our expected return on plan assets downward in 2002 and 2001 and compared to prior periods.
As of the annual measurement date for each plan, we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension obligations could be effectively settled. In estimating this rate, we look to rates of return on long-term, high quality, fixed-income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency. Decreases in the discount rate over the past few years have been driven by a decrease in long-term interest rates and have had two major impacts on our consolidated financial statements: 1.
They contributed, along with decreases in the expected return on plan assets and other assumptions, to increases to our Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO).
Increases in the PBO are not immediately recorded as expenses in the current period. FASB Statement No.87 requires that changes in the PBO (as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience), to be deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense over several years depending on the magnitude of the total deferred gain or loss (see above). For our significant defined benefit pension plans in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the total deferred loss at December31, 2002 that has not yet been recognized through income in the financial statements was approximately $1.6billion.
19 2.
They contributed, along with decreases in the expected return on plan assets and other assumptions, to increases to our Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO), which represents the measurement of pension obligations relating to services performed by active and terminated, as well as retired employees through the current measurement date.
If the ABO exceeds the fair value of plan assets at the measurement date (as measured separately for each plan), GAAP requires that we effectively reverse any prepaid assets previously recognized related to that particular plan and record a pension liability equal to the difference between the ABO and the fair value of plan assets, otherwise referred to as the "minimum pension liability". The adjustment necessary to reverse any prepaid assets previously recognized and establish the minimum pension liability is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) net of applicable deferred income taxes, rather than to income.
For Aon's significant defined benefit pension plans, a combination of declines in the fair value of plan assets and an increase in the ABO has necessitated over time an aggregate pretax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss related to minimum pensions of $1.2billion, or $720million after-tax, as of December31, 2002.
Contingencies We define as a contingency any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact.
For instance, we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter, or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.
Policy Liabilities Through our insurance underwriting operations, we collect premiums from policyholders and we establish liabilities (reserves) to pay benefits to policyholders. The liability for policy benefits, claims and unearned premiums is one of the largest liabilities included in our statements of financial position. This liability is primarily comprised of estimated future payments to policyholders, policy and contract claims, and unearned and advance premiums, and contract fees.
To establish policy liabilities, we rely upon estimates for reported and anticipated claims, our historical experience, other actuarial data and, with respect to accident, health and life liabilities, assumptions on investment yields. Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality and interest rate assumptions are locked-in when we issue new insurance business, we may need to provide for expected losses on a product by reducing previously capitalized acquisition costs established for that product, and/or establishing premium deficiency reserves if there are significant changes in our experience or assumptions.
While we believe that we have estimated these liabilities effectively, the results we finally report in Aon's consolidated financial statements could be affected by trends which do not match historical experience or which differ from our underlying assumptions. Furthermore, when our actual experience differs from our previous estimate, the difference will be reflected in the results we report for the period when we changed our estimate. We always consider trends in actual experience as a significant factor in helping us determine claim reserve levels.
20 REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS General When we refer to organic revenue growth in the discussion of operating results, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, dispositions, transfers, investment income, foreign exchange, and other unusual items. Written premiums are the basis for organic revenue growth within the Insurance Underwriting segment, but our reported revenues reflect earned premiums.
When we refer to income before income tax, we exclude minority interest related to the 8.205% mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (capital securities) (see note11 to the consolidated financial statements) and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see note1 to the consolidated financial statements).
Financial Overview of 2002 Aon achieved good organic revenue growth in 2002, but earnings were below original targets due to several factors. Aon was:  finalizing the delayed implementation of the business transformation plan in its U.S. retail brokerage operations  recovering from the World Trade Center disaster  dealing with the shock to the insurance industry from September11 th , which created significant new demands on employees, as well as new business opportunities  incurring costs to spin off our insurance underwriting operations, which we ultimately decided not to do given market conditions and other factors.
Although these issues negatively impacted earnings because of the increased expenses, revenues grew more than 10% in each operating segment, showing good demand for our products and services. In addition, we completed our business transformation plan and reported the following:  The Consulting segment began a sizeable new outsourcing engagement, which will provide favorable returns over the life of the multi-year agreement. Up-front investment costs to support the new business are having a negative effect on near-term margins  The Insurance Underwriting segment earnings were negatively influenced by unusual events  The Corporate and Other segment reported a significantly smaller pretax loss than in the previous year.
21 During the year, we strengthened our capital structure, raising $607million in new common stock and $519million of new debt, including proceeds of $296million for convertible debt, to extend existing debt maturities, pay down near-term debt, repurchase preferred capital securities and for other general corporate purposes. Partially offsetting the increase in stockholders' equity were increased minimum pension obligations, due mostly to unfavorable financial markets, which reduced stockholders' equity by $552million at year-end.
Summary Results for 2000 through 2002 The consolidated results of operations follow: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Revenue: Brokerage commissions and fees $ 6,202 $ 5,436 $ 4,946 Premiums and other 2,368 2,027 1,921 Investment income 252 213 508 Total consolidated revenue 8,822 7,676 7,375 Expenses: General expenses 6,505 5,813 5,190 Benefits to policyholders 1,375 1,111 1,037 Interest expense 124 127 140 Amortization of intangible assets 54 158 154 Unusual charges (credits)World Trade Center (29 ) 158  Total expenses 8,029 7,367 6,521 Income before income tax and minority interest $ 793 $ 309 $ 854 Consolidated Results for 2002 Compared to 2001 Revenue In 2002:  revenue increased 15% over 2001 to $8.8billion. We saw improvements in brokerage commissions and fees, premiums earned and investment income. Revenue increased 14% when we exclude the effects of foreign exchange rates. We do not directly hedge revenues against foreign currency translation because it is not cost effective, but we do attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on pretax income.
consolidated revenue for the operating segments grew 12% on an organic basis over 2001.
22 Consolidated revenue by geographic area follows: Years ended December 31 2002 % of Total 2001 % of Total 2000 % of Total (millions) Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 5,034 57 % $ 4,463 58 % $ 4,350 59 % United Kingdom 1,621 18 1,390 18 1,363 19 Continent of Europe 1,117 13 938 12 833 11 Rest of World 1,050 12 885 12 829 11 Total revenue $ 8,822 100 % $ 7,676 100 % $ 7,375 100 % U.S. consolidated revenue, which represents 57% of total revenue, increased 13% in 2002 compared to 2001, as a result of strong organic growth. More specifically:  Commercial property and casualty premium rate increases for most lines of coverage continued. As a broker, we benefit from this through increased commissions. In addition, client demand for risk retention programs and services contributed to this increase, especially reinsurance and wholesale brokerage  U.K. and Continent of Europe revenue combined increased 18% to $2.7billion and Rest of World revenue increased 19%, reflecting strong new business, the impact of increasing premium rates that tend to increase commissions and foreign exchange.
Brokerage commissions and fees increased 14% to $6.2billion primarily from organic growth including increased premium rates, increased new business and outsourcing contracts. This was somewhat offset by revenue disruptions in the early part of the year with our managing general underwriter unit. Acquisitions contributed $90million of incremental revenue in 2002.
Premiums and other, primarily related to insurance underwriting operations, improved to $2.4billion, a 17% increase over 2001. The increase:  primarily reflects growth in new business initiatives, traditional accident and health lines, and new specialty property and casualty lines  was somewhat offset by the impact of the prior loss of some accounts in the warranty business.
Investment income, which includes related expenses and income or loss on disposals and impairments, increased by 18% over 2001, despite a drop in interest rates. The increase was driven by:  improved returns on limited partnerships and other private equity investments accounted for on the equity method in 2002  a one-time tax related settlement of $48million.
Offsetting these improvements were impairment write-downs for certain directly owned investments, including those classified as other than temporary, which were $73million higher than last year.
Investment income from our Insurance Brokerage and Other Services and Consulting segments, primarily relating to fiduciary funds, decreased $46million compared to 2001 primarily due to declining interest rates.
23 Expenses Total expenses increased $662million or 9% over 2001. Total expenses rose 15%, excluding the following items:  a $29million credit in 2002 due to a settlement with our insurance carriers regarding reimbursement for depreciable assets destroyed in the World Trade Center  $158million in unusual charges in 2001 related to the World Trade Center (see note1 to the consolidated financial statements) and $218million of expenses in 2001 related to the business transformation plan.
General expenses increased 12% over 2001. Excluding the costs related to the business transformation plan, general expenses rose 16%, reflecting:  growth of the businesses  higher costs in the U.S. retail brokerage business  increased risk management and litigation reserve items  higher overall pension plan costs  issues related to National Program Services,Inc. (NPS), as described below  costs related to the planned spin-off  discontinued underwriting businesses Benefits to policyholders rose $264million or 24% due to new business volume increases, an increased payout ratio of benefits to policyholders versus net premiums earned and a shift in business mix to products with higher benefit payout ratios.
Interest expense was down slightly due to lower short-term interest rates.
Amortization of intangible assets declined $104million from 2001 as goodwill was not amortized in 2002 in accordance with FASB Statement No.142 (see note1 to the consolidated financial statements).
Income Before Income Tax and Minority Interest Income before income tax and minority interest increased significantly from $309million in 2001 to $793million in 2002. This increase is due primarily to the net change in expenses related to the World Trade Center ($187million), the business transformation plan ($224million) and the improvement in Corporate and Other revenue ($150million). Approximately 79% of Aon's consolidated income before income tax and minority interest was from international operations.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 39.5% in 2001 and 37% in 2002. The decline from 2001 was due to the non-deductibility of certain goodwill, which, beginning in 2002, is no longer amortized for book purposes.
The overall effective tax rates are higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily because of state income tax provisions.
Net Income Current year's net income increased to $466million ($1.64 per dilutive share) from $147million ($0.53 per dilutive share) in 2001. Basic net income per share was $1.65 and $0.54 for 2002 and 2001, 24 respectively. Dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stock have been deducted from net income to compute income per share.
Consolidated Results for Fourth Quarter 2002 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2001 Total revenues in the quarter rose 16% to $2.4billion. On a comparable currency basis, revenue climbed 13%. The higher revenue growth reflects:  9% operating segment organic growth primarily as a result of strong demand for Aon's services and products  a $73million improvement in consolidated investment income.
In detail, the higher revenue growth reflects:  Very good results from reinsurance, international and wholesale brokerage  Continued improvement from U.S. retail brokerage over 2001 and increased managing general underwriters production over the first half of 2002, when an insurance carrier had to be switched for some major programs  Consulting segment revenue growth, driven mostly by new outsourcing business initiated in third quarter 2002, and good growth in the Continent of Europe and Pacific regions  Accident and health insurance premium growth and premium growth for certain specialty insurance programs  Significantly improved investment income from last year, when unfavorable equity markets negatively impacted results.
Income before income taxes and minority interest increased by $225million. Excluding the impact of the World Trade Center credit in 2002 and charge in 2001, income before income taxes and minority interest rose 64%.
Strong revenue growth and the absence of goodwill amortization in 2002 was partially offset by:  the addition of new lower margin outsourcing business in our Consulting segment  losses and other costs attributable to Aon's decision to discontinue certain accident and health insurance underwriting in Latin America and large company group life businesses in the Insurance Underwriting segment  costs associated with previous spin-off plans, and related items, that will not be pursued.
Consolidated Results for 2001 Compared to 2000 Revenue Total revenues were $7.7billion, an increase of 4%. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates, revenues increased 6% over the comparable period. Improvements in brokerage commissions and fees, as well as premiums earned, were partially offset by a decline in investment income resulting from decreased valuations of limited partnerships, lower interest rates and higher losses on disposals of investments. In addition, there was a falloff in parts of U.S. retail brokerage revenue primarily due to slower new account generation and below normal client retention.
Consolidated organic revenue growth was 8% in 2001. For the year, acquisitions net of dispositions improved operating revenues by $207million.
25 U.S. revenues, which represent 58% of total revenue, increased 3% in 2001 compared to 2000 as organic growth and acquisition activity was partially offset by declines in parts of the retail brokerage business as well as a significant drop in investment income.
U.K. and Continent of Europe revenues combined increased 6% to $2.3billion and Rest of World revenue of $885million increased 7% reflecting acquisitions, new business and the impact of increasing premium rates that tend to increase commissions.
Brokerage commissions and fees increased 10% to $5.4billion, primarily from organic growth in non-U.S. retail brokerage and worldwide reinsurance brokerage, business combination activity, increased new business and the impact of increased property and casualty premium rates. This growth was offset somewhat by unfavorable results in parts of U.S. retail brokerage due to delays in implementing the business transformation plan.
Premiums and other increased 6% in 2001 to $2.0billion. This increase primarily reflects:  continued organic growth  strong growth in lower margin new business initiatives  the impact of the acquisition of First Extended,Inc.
This increase was somewhat offset by the loss of some accounts in the warranty business, in addition to a general slowdown in the economy.
Investment income, which includes related expenses and income or loss on disposals and impairments, decreased significantly when compared to 2000, primarily reflecting:  reduced valuations on equity investments in limited partnerships  lower short-term interest rates. In particular, declining interest rates affected investment income from the Insurance Brokerage and Other Services and Consulting segments, primarily relating to fiduciary funds; this income decreased $31million compared to 2000.
the other than temporary impairment recorded for certain directly owned equity investments. Returns on private equity investments tend to fluctuate due to the inherent volatility of equity securities.
Expenses General expenses increased 12% over 2000. Excluding costs related to business transformation in 2001 and 2000, general expenses increased $487million or 10% over 2000 primarily reflecting:  expenditures to grow the brokerage business  the impact of acquisitions  transition costs related to the business transformation plan.
Benefits to policyholders rose $74million or 7% as a result of new underwriting initiatives and an unusual increase in warranty claims related to an isolated program that will not affect future periods.
Interest expense decreased 9% or $13million from prior year, partly attributable to decreases in short-term interest rates and lower average debt balances.
Unusual chargesWorld Trade Center represent:  $135million of insurance benefits paid  a $10million commitment to the Aon Memorial Education Fund to support the education needs of the children of Aon employees who were victims of the September11 th attacks 26  $13million of other costs that may not be recoverable from insurance.
Income Before Income Tax and Minority Interest Income before income tax and minority interest declined significantly from $854million in 2000 to $309million in 2001, due to:  expenses in 2001 related to the events of September11th  slower revenue growth in parts of the U.S. retail brokerage business due to delays in the implementation of the business transformation plan  an increase in year-over-year business transformation expenses of $136million  a decline in consolidated investment income of $295million.
All of our consolidated income before income tax is from non-U.S. operations.
Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 39.5% for 2001 and 39% for 2000. The overall effective tax rates are higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily because of state income tax provisions and the non-deductibility of certain goodwill amortization.
Net Income Net income for 2001 was $147million or $0.53 per dilutive share compared to $474million or $1.79 per dilutive share in 2000. Basic net income per share was $0.54 and $1.81 for 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2000, Aon adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.101, which resulted in a one-time cumulative non-cash charge of $7million after-tax ($0.03 per share).We have deducted dividends on the redeemable preferred stock from net income to compute income per share.
REVIEW BY SEGMENT General Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments:Insurance Brokerage and Other Services, Consulting and Insurance Underwriting (see note16 to the consolidated financial statements). Aon's operating segments are identified as those that:  report separate financial information  are evaluated regularly when we are deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
Total revenue for each of the operating segments is presented both by major product and service and by geographic area in note16 to the consolidated financial statements. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues.
Because our culture fosters interdependence among the operating units, allocating expenses by product and geography is difficult. While we track and evaluate revenue for each segment, expenses are allocated to products and services within each of the operating segments. In addition to revenue, we also measure each segment's financial performance using its income before income tax.
27 Operating segment revenue includes investment income, as well as the impact of related derivatives, generated by operating invested assets of that segment. Investment characteristics mirror liability characteristics of the respective operating segments:  Our Insurance Brokerage and Other Services and Consulting businesses invest fiduciary funds and operating funds in shorter-term obligations  In Insurance Underwriting, policyholder claims and other types of non-interest sensitive insurance liabilities are primarily supported by intermediate to long-term fixed-maturity instruments. Investments underlying interest-sensitive capital accumulation insurance liabilities are fixed- or floating-rate fixed- maturity obligations. For this business segment, operating invested assets are equivalent to average net policy liabilities  Our insurance subsidiaries also have invested assets that exceed average net policy liabilities, in order to maintain solid claims paying ratings. These investments are mostly equity related and income from these investments are reflected in Corporate and Other segment revenues.
The following tables and commentary provide selected financial information on the operating segments.
Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Operating segment revenue: Insurance Brokerage and Other Services $ 5,263 $ 4,659 $ 4,367 Consulting 1,054 938 770 Insurance Underwriting 2,526 2,250 2,167 Total operating segments $ 8,843 $ 7,847 $ 7,304 Income before income tax: Insurance Brokerage and Other Services $ 763 $ 524 $ 690 Consulting 120 126 106 Insurance Underwriting 152 150 300 Total income before income taxoperating segments $ 1,035 $ 800 $ 1,096 Insurance Brokerage and Other Services Aon is a leader in many sectors of the insurance industry: globally, it is the second largest insurance broker, the largest reinsurance broker and the leading manager of captive insurance companies worldwide. In the U.S., Aon is the second largest multi-line claims services provider, and the largest wholesale broker and underwriting manager. These rankings are based on most recent surveys compiled and reports printed by Business Insurance.
Insurance Brokerage and Other Services generated approximately 60% of Aon's total operating segment revenues in 2002. Revenues are generated primarily through:  fees paid by clients  commissions and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies  certain other carrier compensation  interest income on funds held primarily in a fiduciary capacity.
Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of:  how our clients' policy renewals are timed 28  the net effect of new and lost business  volume-based commissions and overrides  the timing of services provided to our clients  the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by short-term interest rates.
Although expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year, in 2001 expenses were increased by the business transformation plan and the terrorist attacks of September11 th .
This segment:  addresses the highly specialized product development, consulting and risk management needs of professional groups, service businesses, governments, healthcare providers, commercial organizations and non-profit groups, among others  provides affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income and personal lines for individuals, associations and businesses. Certain operating subsidiaries provide marketing and brokerage services to both the primary insurance and reinsurance sectors  offers claims management and loss cost management services to insurance companies and firms with self-insurance programs  provides wholesale brokerage, managing underwriting and premium finance services to independent agents and brokers.
The Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment revenues vary because a large part of our compensation is tied to the premiums paid by those we insure, and both premium rate levels in the property and casualty insurance markets and available insurance capacity also fluctuate.
Revenue Total 2002 Insurance Brokerage and Other Services revenue was $5.3billion, up 13% on a reported basis. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, revenue rose 12% over last year. Most of this growth was organic, including the impact of hardening premium rates. U.S. and international retail, reinsurance and wholesale brokerage all posted solid revenue growth. Insurance Brokerage and Other Services operating revenue, on an organic basis, grew approximately 12% in a very competitive environment. Investment income decreased $43million in 2002 as short-term interest rates declined.
Continuing the trend from last year, increases in insurance premium rates benefited revenues in 2002. After September11 th , insurance markets whose premium rates were rising already rose further as a result of restrictions on the availability of some coverages and the pressure on the financial strength of some insurance companies. The property and casualty insurance market is very competitive. As premium rates rise, clients often retain more risk. This dynamic has, and may continue to, limit revenue growth, for pure brokerage services, but it provides opportunities to offer more captive insurance and claims management services, as well as safety and loss control services.
29 This chart shows Insurance Brokerage and Other Services revenue by geographic area and pretax income: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 2,604 $ 2,425 $ 2,277 United Kingdom 1,087 918 889 Continent of Europe 857 733 654 Rest of World 715 583 547 Total revenue $ 5,263 $ 4,659 $ 4,367 Income before income tax $ 763 $ 524 $ 690 In 2002, U.S. revenue of $2.6billion rose 7% primarily from organic growth, including premium rate increases, and the impact of acquisitions. This growth was partially offset, however, by lower investment income due to lower interest rates, along with a $24million fee earned in 2001 in connection with the formation of Endurance Specialty Insurance,Ltd. Underperformance in the managing underwriting group and U.S. retail brokerage in 2002 tempered growth in the U.S.
U.K. and Continent of Europe revenues of $1.9billion increased 18% from 2001 primarily as a result of organic growth driven by higher insurance premium rates and new business.
Rest of World revenue increased $132million or 23%, primarily reflecting organic growth resulting from new business, improved renewal rates, and the positive impact of premium rate increases on commissions.
Income Before Income Tax Pretax income increased $239million from 2001 to $763million. In 2002, pretax margins in this segment were 14.5%, up from 11.2% in 2001.
These increases were due:  principally to lower net business transformation costs between 2002 and 2001 of $193million and lower transition costs in 2002 versus 2001 of $20million  secondarily, to a $29million reimbursement we received in 2002 from our property insurers for depreciable assets destroyed on September11 th , which represents the difference between insurance reimbursements and the net book value of our destroyed assets. We have replaced most of these assets, and the depreciation on these assets will affect future income. In 2001, the destruction of the World Trade Center resulted in expenses of $23million.
Pretax income, excluding these items, fell 1% from 2001 to $728million. Pretax margins, excluding these items, were 13.8% for 2002 versus 15.8% last year. The margin decline was principally driven by higher costs in certain parts of the U.S. retail business and lower revenue in our managing underwriting group.
Also contributing to the adjusted pretax margin decline were increased compensation costs including higher pension costs and some one-time special incentive compensation, reduced investment income and lower claims handling fees. These items more than offset strong organic growth and business transformation savings.
30 Consulting Aon Consulting is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations.This segment:  provides a full range of human capital management services, from employee benefits to compensation consulting  generates 12% of Aon's total operating segment revenues. The acquisition of ASI in 2001 significantly expanded our abilities, especially our outsourcing services.
Consulting services are delivered to corporate clients through five major practices: 1.
Employee benefits constructs and implements benefit packages, and conducts proprietary research on employee commitment and loyalty.
2.
Compensation focuses on designing salary, bonus, commission, stock option and other pay structures, with special expertise in the financial institution and technology fields.
3.
Management consulting assists clients in process improvement and design, leadership, organization and human capital development.
4.
Outsourcing offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration and other employment services.
5.
Communications advises clients on how to communicate on initiatives that support their corporate vision.
Revenues in the Consulting segment are affected by changes in clients' industries, including government regulation, as well as new products and services, the state of the economic cycle, broad trends in employee demographics and the management of large organizations.
Revenue In 2002, revenues of $1.1billion increased 12% over 2001. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, the growth rate was 11%. Globally, the improvement in revenue was influenced by 9% organic growth as well as acquisitions. Organic revenue owed a significant portion of its growth to a sizeable human resources outsourcing agreement which we initiated in third quarter 2002. Good growth also occurred in the Continent of Europe and the Pacific region, as well as the management consulting group.
Despite this year's growth, economic conditions continue to be difficult for this segment: the sluggish global economy, a slowdown in client hiring and slower discretionary spending by clients, has put pressure on organic revenue growth. Investment income in the Consulting segment was down $3million from 2001 due to lower interest rates.
31 This chart shows Consulting revenue by geographic area and pretax income: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 703 $ 628 $ 486 United Kingdom 160 157 151 Continent of Europe 105 77 67 Rest of World 86 76 66 Total revenue $ 1,054 $ 938 $ 770 Income before income tax $ 120 $ 126 $ 106 From 2001:  U.S. revenue of $703million grew 12%, primarily reflecting the new outsourcing agreement in 2002 and the 2001 acquisition of ASI, combined with growth in the employee benefits practice and management consulting  Continent of Europe and Rest of World revenues rose $38million on organic growth.
Income Before Income Tax Pretax income was $120million, a 5% decline from last year. In 2002, pretax margins in this segment were 11.4%, down from 13.4% in 2001. Excluding expenses related to business transformation in 2001, pretax income fell 10% in 2002, and in 2001, pretax margin was 14.2%.
Pretax margins were reduced by a large new human resources outsourcing contract. Although this contract is expected to provide favorable returns over the life of the multi-year agreement, it pressured margins in 2002 for the following reasons:  outsourcing business has lower margins than other consulting businesses  up-front costs were incurred to secure the new contract  revenues for sub-contractors under the contract flow through our income statement even though we merely pass them on without receiving any income from them  margins are lower at the beginning of the contract since we inherited the client's cost structure and we plan to create efficiencies to improve margins through the life of the contract.
Insurance Underwriting The Insurance Underwriting segment:  provides supplemental accident, health and life insurance coverage mostly through direct distribution networks, primarily 7,500 career insurance agents, working for our subsidiaries  offers extended warranty and casualty insurance products that are sold through retailers, automotive dealers, insurance agents and brokers and real estate brokers  offers select commercial property and casualty business on a limited basis through managing general underwriters, primarily Aon-owned companies  has operations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific  generates approximately 28% of Aon's total operating segment revenues.
32 In the accident, health and life operations, we provide an array of accident, sickness, short-term disability and other supplemental insurance products. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations, and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.
We have developed relationships with select brokers and consultants to reach specific niche markets. In addition to the traditional business sold by our career agents, we have expanded product distribution to include direct response programs, affinity groups and worksite marketing, creating access to new markets and potential new policyholders. In fourth quarter 2002, we announced our plans to sell Sheffield Insurance Corporation, a small property-casualty company. In early 2003, we announced plans to discontinue our accident and health insurance underwriting operations in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, as well as our large company group life business in the U.S.
Our subsidiaries in North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and Europe provide warranties on automobiles and a variety of consumer goods, including electronics and appliances. In addition, we provide non-structural home warranties and other warranty products, such as credit card enhancements and affinity warranty programs. Revenues earned from non-risk bearing activities and the administration of certain extended warranty services on automobiles, electronic goods, personal computers and appliances are reflected in the Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment based on how the business is reviewed by management.
Revenue In 2002, revenues of $2.5billion increased 12% over 2001. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, revenues rose by 11%. Improvement over last year was driven by:  strong organic growth of 14%  new specialty property and casualty insurance business and newer accident and health insurance programs.
Partially offsetting core business growth was lower investment income of $65million as well as the loss of several accounts in the extended warranty business.
This chart details Insurance Underwriting revenue by geographic area and pretax income: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Revenue by geographic area: United States $ 1,784 $ 1,615 $ 1,545 United Kingdom 363 302 308 Continent of Europe 151 125 111 Rest of World 228 208 203 Total revenue $ 2,526 $ 2,250 $ 2,167 Income before income tax $ 152 $ 150 $ 300 In 2002, U.S. revenue increased $169million to $1.8billion. The increase was primarily driven by new product initiatives and increased revenues for accident and health products, which more than offset declines in investment income, which includes guaranteed investment contract revenue. (Expenses related to guaranteed investment contracts are reflected in benefits to policyholders.) U.K. and Continent of Europe revenue increased 20% to $514million. Rest of World revenue was up 10% to $228million.
33 The discontinued and sold businesses generated approximately $100million of earned premium in 2002.
Income Before Income Tax Pretax income of $152million increased 1% from 2001. Pretax margins fell from 6.7% in 2001 to 6.0% in 2002.
Excluding spin-off plan expenses in 2002 ($33million pretax) and the World Trade Center ($135million pretax) and business transformation costs ($24million pretax) in 2001, pretax income of $185million in 2002 fell significantly from $309million in 2001. Pretax margins declined from 13.7% in 2001 to 7.3% in 2002. The remainder of the spin-off costs are included in the Corporate and Other segment.
Reasons for the decline in pretax income and margin include:  an increased payout ratio of benefits to policyholders  losses involving NPS. NPS was an independent managing general agent hired to handle quoting, binding, premium collection, claims adjusting and other servicing related to general liability insurance policies issued by one of Aon's subsidiaries. We stopped NPS from initiating any new Aon business in mid-2002 after we obtained a temporary restraining order. We and others sued NPS for fraud, among other things. Based on our review of policies issued, we provided an additional $21million to increase loss reserves and for other expenses, as well as $15million for an allowance against the receivable owed to us by NPS  losses at certain unprofitable underwriting units, including accident and health insurance underwriting in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil and large company group life business in the U.S.
a decline in investment income  a provision for non-claims litigation.
Corporate and Other Corporate and Other segment revenue consists primarily of investment income (including income or loss on disposals, including impairment losses), which is not otherwise reflected in the operating segments. This segment includes invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, together with the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries and related income.
Private equities are principally carried at cost except where Aon has significant influence, in which case they are carried under the equity method. These investments usually do not pay dividends.
Limited partnerships are accounted for on the equity method and changes in the value of the underlying limited partnership investments flow through Corporate and Other segment revenue. Because the limited partnership investments include exchange-traded securities, Corporate and Other segment revenue fluctuates with the market values of underlying publicly traded equity investments. Limited partnership investments have historically provided higher returns over a longer time than broad market common stock. However, in the short run, the returns are inherently more variable.
On December31, 2001, we securitized $450million of our limited partnership investments plus associated limited partnership commitments, which represented the majority of our limited partnership interests. In connection with the securitization, we received a combination of cash ($171million) and securities ($279million). This transaction has lessened the variability of revenue reported in the Corporate and Other segment. The limited partnership investments were included in our consolidated 34 statement of financial position prior to the securitization and the cash and securities received from the securitization are also included in Aon's consolidated statement of financial position.
Although our portfolios are highly diversified, they still remain exposed to market, equity and credit risk.
Our fixed-maturity portfolio had a $37million gross unrealized loss at December31, 2002, including $6million related to deferred amortizable derivative losses, and is subject to interest rate, market and credit risks. With a carrying value of $2.1billion at December31, 2002, our total fixed-maturity portfolio is 94% investment grade based on market value. Fixed-maturity securities with an unrealized loss are 87% investment grade and have a weighted average rating of "A" based on amortized cost.
The equity portfolio is comprised of:  non-redeemable preferred stocks. This portfolio had a $2million gross unrealized loss at December31, 2002, and is subject to interest rate, market, credit and illiquidity risks  publicly traded common stocks. The common stock portfolio had no gross unrealized loss at December31, 2002 and is subject to market risk  other common and preferred stocks not publicly traded. These investments had a $13million gross unrealized loss at December31, 2002, and are subject to illiquidity, concentration and operation performance risks.
The following table analyzes our investment positions with unrealized losses segmented by quality and period of continuous unrealized loss (excluding deferred amortizable derivative losses of $6million) as of December31, 2002.

36 At December31, 2002, our:  diversified fixed-maturity portfolio had 66 positions with $31million of total gross unrealized losses, excluding deferred amortizable derivative losses. No single position had an unrealized loss greater than $2million.
equity portfolio, including non-redeemable preferred stocks, had 8 positions with $2million of total gross unrealized losses. No single position had an unrealized loss greater than $1million.
investments classified as other investments in the consolidated statements of financial position had a $13million gross unrealized loss at December31, 2002. The gross unrealized loss relates to preferred stock interests of Private Equity Partnerships Structures I, LLC (PEPS I), a QSPE, acquired on December31, 2001. These preferred stock interests represent beneficial interests in securitized limited partnership investments. The fair value of the private preferred stock interests is dependent on the value of the limited partnership investments held by PEPS I. Management assesses other than temporary declines in the fair value below cost using a financial model that considers the value of the underlying limited partnership investments of PEPS I and the nature and timing of the cash flows from the underlying limited partnership investments of PEPS I.
non publicly-traded fixed-maturity portfolio had a carrying value of $166million, including $115million in notes received from PEPS I on December31, 2001 related to the securitization of limited partnerships and $40million in notes issued by PEPS I to Aon during 2002. Valuations of these securities primarily reflect the fundamental analysis of the issuer and current market price of comparable securities.
We:  periodically review securities with material unrealized losses and evaluate them for other than temporary impairments. We analyze various risk factors and determine if any specific asset impairments exist. If we determine there is a specific asset impairment, we recognize a realized loss and adjust the cost basis of the impaired asset to its fair value.
review invested assets with material unrealized losses each quarter. Those assets are separated into two categories: (1) assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events, which we segment among four categories: fixed-maturity investments; preferred stocks; publicly traded common stocks; and private equities and other invested assets.
(2) assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events.
Assets with unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events: Fixed-maturity investments.
At least quarterly, we:  review the creditworthiness of corporate obligors for changes by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and changes in fundamental financial performance of the underlying entity.
monitor cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral for asset-backed securities.
evaluate all bonds and asset-backed securities whose financial performance has declined for other than temporary impairment.
37 Preferred stocks.
We review issuer creditworthiness at least quarterly. Creditworthiness factors reviewed include nationally recognized credit rating agency rating changes and changes in financial performance of the underlying issuer. We monitor all preferred stock investments with declining financial performance for other than temporary impairment.
Publicly traded common stocks.
Quarterly, we review each common stock investment to determine if its decline in value is deemed other than temporary. Criteria include a review of issuer financial trends, and market expectations based on third-party forward-looking analytical reports, when available.
Private common stocks and other invested assets.
We review quarterly private issue valuations, which include recent transaction valuations between the issuer and a third party; financial performance reviews; and financial trend comparisons with publicly traded companies in the same or similar industries.
We recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when appropriate for fixed-maturity investments, common and preferred stock and other investments with continuous material unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events. We base this decision upon the facts and circumstances for each investment in accordance with SAB 59, FASB Statement No.115 and related guidance.
Invested assets with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events include those negatively impacted by increasing U.S. Treasury or local sovereign interest rates; corporate and asset-backed credit spread widening; common stock price volatility due to conditions in the overall market or a particular industry; and illiquid market conditions.
Under some conditions, we assume that a decline in value below cost is not other than temporary. We make this assumption for fixed-maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events when:  we expect the market to recover  management has no current positive intent to sell  we have the intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or the market recovers, which is a decisive factor when considering an impairment loss. If we decide that holding the investment no longer makes sense, we again evaluate that investment for other than temporary impairment.
We recognize an other than temporary impairment loss based upon each investment's facts and circumstances, in accordance with SAB 59, FASB Statement No.115 and related guidance. We continue to monitor these securities quarterly to ensure that unrealized losses do not result from issuer-specific events.
We evaluate for other than temporary impairment preferred and common stock and other investments with continuous material unrealized losses for two consecutive quarters due to market conditions or industry-related events. We recognize an other than temporary impairment loss based upon each investment's facts and circumstances. We continue to monitor these securities quarterly to ensure that unrealized losses are not the result of issuer-specific events.
There are three risks inherent in the assessment methodology:  market factors may differ from our expectations  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen liquidity needs  the credit assessment or equity characteristics may change from our original assessment.
38 This chart shows the components of Corporate and Other revenue and expenses: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Corporate and other revenue: Limited partnership investments $ 14 $ (94 ) $ 73 Income from marketable equity securities and other investments 31 7 9 Corporate and other revenue before net loss on disposals and related expenses and one-time items 45 (87 ) 82 Interest on tax refund 48   Net loss on disposals and related expenses (114 ) (84 ) (11 ) Corporate and other revenue $ (21 ) $ (171 ) $ 71 Non-operating expenses: General expenses $ 97 $ 75 $ 59 Interest expense 124 127 140 Amortization of goodwill  118 114 Loss before income tax $ (242 ) $ (491 ) $ (242 ) Revenue Corporate and Other revenue improved by $150million to a negative $21million in 2002 from a negative $171million in 2001. The revenue improvement was primarily driven by:  a rise in the value of private limited partnership investments. These investments had been negatively impacted by unfavorable market conditions in 2001.
$48million of interest income we received in 2002 from the settlement of a prior year tax issue.
Offsetting the positive valuation gains were impairment write-downs of certain fixed-maturity and equity investments of $130million in 2002 (including $51million cumulative effect of the change in policy for recognizing other than temporary impairments from previous years) compared to $57million in 2001.
Loss Before Income Tax Corporate and Other expenses were $221million, an improvement of $99million from the comparable period in 2001. This decrease in expenses is primarily due to goodwill amortization. Beginning in 2002, goodwill was no longer amortized (see note1 to the consolidated financial statements). Compared to 2001:  Interest expense declined $3million primarily from lower short-term interest rates.
General expenses rose $22million due principally to $17million of corporate overhead costs related to the previous planned divestiture of the underwriting businesses.
These revenue and expense comparisons contributed to the overall Corporate and Other pretax loss of $242million in 2002 versus a loss of $491million in 2001.
Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations include certain insurance underwriting subsidiaries acquired with Alexander and Alexander Services,Inc. (A&A) that are in run-off and the indemnification by A&A of certain liabilities relating to subsidiaries sold by A&A before its acquisition by Aon.
39 Management believes that, based on current estimates, these discontinued operations are adequately reserved. The net liability is included as a component of other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position. In 2002, Aon settled certain of these liabilities. The settlement had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Liquidity Our routine liquidity needs are primarily for servicing debt and for paying dividends on outstanding stock and capital securities. Our primary source for meeting these requirements is from dividends and internal financing from our operating subsidiaries. After meeting our routine dividend and debt servicing requirements, we used a portion of the remaining funding received throughout the year to expand our operating segment businesses and invest in acquisitions. (Note11 to the consolidated financial statements discusses regulatory restrictions relating to dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries.) Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus at year-end 2002 exceeded the risk-based capital target set by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners by a satisfactory level. We have advised the rating agencies that we do not expect our two major U.S. insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Aon in 2003. Beyond 2003, we expect these U.S. subsidiaries to consider resuming paying dividends.
Our operating subsidiaries anticipate that there will be adequate liquidity to meet their needs in the foreseeable future and to provide funds to the parent company. We have used cash flow primarily for:  debt reduction  dividend payments  business reinvestment  acquisition financing  payments of business transformation and other special charge and purchase accounting liabilities.
We expect our subsidiaries' positive cash flow to continue, and with it, our ability to access adequate short-term lines of credit.
Cash on our statements of financial position includes funds available for general corporate purposes and funds we are holding on behalf of clients and to satisfy policyholder liabilities.
Cash Flows Cash flows from operations represent the net income we earned in the reported periods adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Cash flows provided by operating activities for 2002 were $1.2billion. However, not all funds generated were available for use by us.
Net income attributable to our insurance subsidiaries was approximately $50million, net of losses on disposals recognized in our Corporate and Other segment, and changes in their operating assets and liabilities, net of reinsurance, represented $335million in 2002. This was primarily due to unearned premiums and other fees recorded and collected by the specialty property and casualty group (which includes extended warranty) as a result of an increase in its insurance retention on several client programs and new property and casualty business. The majority of these funds will be used to satisfy future benefits to policyholders with the remainder being available, after taxes and other income and expense, for dividend to Aon in future years. The operating cash flow from our insurance subsidiaries of $385million was not available for general corporate purposes in 2002. Also, in 2002, we decided not 40 to upstream any of the insurance underwriting subsidiaries' earnings to Aon parent company in order to enhance their financial positions even further.
In our insurance brokerage and consulting businesses we collect cash payments from clients that include both premiums (payable to insurance companies for policies they issue) and commissions and fees (payable to us for our brokerage and consulting services). The commissions and fees are recorded by us as income. For a short time period, we hold clients' premiums in fiduciary accounts before remitting them to insurers. When a payment is due from a client for premiums, commissions and fees, we establish a receivable for the gross amount and a payable to the insurance company for the premium portions. The net balance for these are reflected in "Other receivables and liabilities, net". For 2003, the net difference between these receivables and payables added approximately $300million to cash flow from operations, but are only held temporarily by us on behalf of our clients and/or carriers.
During the fourth quarter 2002, we raised $607million by issuing 36.8million shares of new common equity and $519million by issuing long-term debt.
A total of $1.7billion in cash from available operating cash flows and debt and equity net proceeds was primarily used for the following purposes:  pay down commercial paper, other short-term debt and notes payable, as well as repurchase a portion of our trust preferred stock ($797million)  $150million was kept liquid and used for January2003 debt repayment  pay dividends to our stockholders of $233million  investment in operations:  expenditures for property and equipment consumed $278million  acquisition of businesses used $111million  cash increased by $67million.
Withdrawals of $682million from "interest sensitive, annuity and investment-type contracts" were funded primarily by sales of fixed maturity investments. We have decided to stop issuing these contracts and we are exiting the business.
Financial Condition Since year-end 2001, total assets increased $3.0billion to $25.3billion. Invested assets at December31, 2002 increased $441million from last year:  primarily from an increase in short-term investments, related to fiduciary funds, partially offset by sales of preferred stock during the year  funds raised from issuing new common equity  notes offerings.
Most of the funds raised were used to:  pay down commercial paper, other short-term debt and notes payable  repurchase a portion of our trust preferred stock.
We also used $150million in January2003 to repay maturing debt securities.
Insurance brokerage and consulting services receivables increased $1.5billion in 2002 with a corresponding increase in insurance premiums payable of $1.7billion. These increases reflect:  the continued rise in premium rates across most lines of business 41  the escalating client demand for risk programs  Aon's strong overall new account growth.
Other assets are comprised principally of prepaid premiums related to reinsurance and prepaid pension assets. The increase of $56million from 2001 represents higher prepaid premiums, which offset a reduction in the pension assets due to the additional minimum pension liability adjustment in fourth quarter 2002. During 2002, some of our defined benefit pension plans, particularly in the United Kingdom, incurred significant valuation losses in the investments backing the related pension obligation, as a result of a decline in the international equity markets and a decline in interest rates.
Other liabilities increased $602million from 2001 due to the increase in our minimum pension liability. We are required to maintain, at a minimum, a liability equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations.
Other policyholder funds decreased $674million in 2002, due primarily to interest sensitive and investment-type contracts maturing and our decision to stop offering these programs.
Aon's consolidated statement of financial position as of December31, 2002 contains:  a general expense liability of $53million related to purchase restructuring liabilities (see note4 to the consolidated financial statements)  $28million related to the business transformation plan (see note5 to the consolidated financial statements).
We anticipate paying most of the outstanding termination benefits over the next few years. The remaining items primarily reflect lease obligations and will run off over a period of up to ten years. We do not expect that payments for termination benefits and lease obligations will have a material impact on cash flows in subsequent periods. As planned, we have made payments that have reduced our restructuring liabilities related to recent acquisitions and prior year charges.
Capital Resources Capital Enhancement Actions During the fourth quarter 2002, Aon raised net proceeds of $519million by issuing long-term debt as follows:  we received $296million ($300million aggregate principal amount) by privately placing 10-year convertible senior debentures due 2012 with a 3.5% coupon rate. The debentures are unsecured obligations, initially convertible, under certain circumstances, into Aon common stock at a conversion price of approximately $21.475 per common share (see note8 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, we will be required to pay additional contingent interest, beginning November15, 2007, if the trading price of the debentures for each of the five trading days immediately preceding the first day of the six-month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the debentures. Beginning November19, 2007, we may redeem any of the debentures at an initial redemption price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Interest on the debentures is payable semiannually in arrears on May15 and November15 of each year, beginning May15, 2003.
we also received $223million ($225million aggregate principal amount) by privately placing 10-year senior term notes due 2012. Interest on these notes will accrue at a coupon rate of 7.375%. This interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June14 and December14 of each year, beginning June14, 2003.
During that same quarter, Aon raised $607million by issuing 36.8million shares of new common equity at $17.18 per share. The offering was made pursuant to an existing shelf registration statement.
42 In 2002, we used funds received from the debt and equity offerings to:  pay down commercial paper and other short-term debt  partially repurchase certain debt securities due in 2003 and 2004  repurchase approximately $98million of our 8.205% trust preferred capital securities. Beginning in 2003, minority interest on the capital securities will be approximately $9million per quarter, reflecting the repurchase  On January15, 2003, we used a portion of the funds from the offerings to redeem $150million of outstanding debt securities with an interest rate of LIBOR +1%.
Short-term Borrowings and Notes Payable Total debt at December31, 2002 was $1.8billion, down from $2billion at December31, 2001. Specifically:  Short-term debt declined $140million, reflecting the paydown of the Euro credit facility and other foreign short-term debt.
Notes payable decreased by $23million compared to year-end 2001. Commercial paper outstanding declined to $1million from $254million at December31, 2001. In 2001, all of our commercial paper was classified as notes payable in the consolidated statements of financial position based on Aon's intent and ability to maintain or refinance these obligations on a long-term basis.
Contractual maturities of notes payable and operating lease commitments (with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year) are disclosed in note8 to the consolidated financial statements.
In 2002, we renegotiated our back-up lines of credit. Anticipating the previously planned spin-off of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries, we reduced our line of credit to $875million. As a result of our capital enhancement actions, we renegotiated our short-term back-up lines of credit, reducing the total amount to $775million in February2003. This agreement will expire in 2005.
To achieve tax-efficient financing, we renegotiated a new committed revolving bank credit facility in September2001, under which certain European subsidiaries can borrow up to EUR 500million. As of December31, 2002, Aon had borrowed EUR 74million ($76million) under this facility, all of which is classified as short-term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial position.
The major rating agencies' ratings of our debt securities at December31, 2002 appear in the table below.
Standard And Poor's Moody's Investor Services Fitch, Inc.
Senior long-term debt A- Baa2 A- Commercial paper A-2 P-2 F-2 Aon's principal insurance underwriting subsidiaries are rated "A", with a stable outlook byA.M. Best for their claims paying ability.
Aon borrows funds from, and lends funds to, its various subsidiaries. As of December31, 2002, we had obligations to our subsidiaries of approximately $433million. These obligations have competitive interest rates.
43 Stockholders' Equity Stockholders' equity increased $430million during 2002, reflecting:  the $607million raised by issuing 36.8million shares of new common equity at $17.18 per share  net income before preferred dividends of $466million.
Partially offsetting the increase were dividends paid to stockholders of $233million. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $419million since December31, 2001. Net foreign exchange losses improved by $69million primarily because of the weakening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies as compared to the prior year. Net derivative gains increased $22million over year-end 2001. Net unrealized investment gains rose $42million during 2002, driven principally by the recognition of $130million pretax ($82million after-tax) write-downs in the consolidated statement of income during 2002. These investment write-downs did not affect total stockholders' equity.
During 2002, some of our defined benefit pension plans, particularly in the United Kingdom, incurred significant valuation losses in the investments backing the related pension obligation. These losses were primarily a result of the decline in the international equity markets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. require a company to maintain, at a minimum, a liability on its balance sheet equal to the difference between the present value of benefits incurred to date for pension obligations and the fair value of the assets supporting these obligations. At year-end 2002, this increased pension obligation caused a $552million (after-tax) reduction to stockholders' equity. We maintain the related pension plan assets in separate trust accounts; they are not part of our consolidated financial statements. This non-cash adjustment did not affect 2002 earnings.
For 2003, we project our pension expense to increase by $130million over what was recorded in 2002. The increase in our pension expense was significantly impacted by the unrecognized loss of $1.6billion at December31, 2002. We also expect cash contributions for the defined benefit pension plans to increase by $40million in 2003. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be required to contribute significant additional amounts to our pension plans to satisfy provisions of the principal credit facility which supports our commercial paper program. We expect, however, to amend or replace such credit facilities.
At December31, 2002, stockholders' equity per share was $12.56, down from $12.82 at December31, 2001, due to the impact of increased pension obligations.
Special Purpose Entities We use special purpose entities and qualifying special purpose entities (QSPE), also known as special purpose vehicles, in some of our operations, following the guidance of FASB Statement No.140 and other relevant accounting guidance.
Certain of our special purpose vehicles were formed solely to purchase financing receivables and sell those balances to conduits owned and managed by third-party financial institutions. Subject to certain limitations, agreements provide for sales to these conduit vehicles continuing through December2005. As of December31, 2002, the maximum commitment contained in these agreements was $1.7billion.
Under the agreements, the receivables are sold to the conduits. Consequently, the conduits bear the credit risks on the receivables, subject to limited recourse in the form of credit loss reserves provided by our subsidiaries and which we guarantee. Under these recourse provisions, our maximum credit risk was approximately $97million at December31, 2002. We intend to renew these conduit facilities when they expire. If there are adverse bank, regulatory, tax or accounting rule changes, our access to the conduit facilities and special purpose vehicles would be restricted. These special purpose vehicles are not included in our consolidated financial statements.
44 On December31, 2001, we sold the vast majority of our limited partnership (LP) portfolio, valued at $450million, to PEPS I, a QSPE. The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company, owned by one of our subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which we do not control, established for victims of the September11 th attacks (51%).
PEPS I:  sold approximately $171million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities to unaffiliated third parties  then paid our insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171million in cash and issued them an additional $279million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities.
The fixed-maturity securities our subsidiaries received from PEPS I are rated as investment grade by Standard& Poor's Ratings Services. As part of this transaction, the insurance companies are required to purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded LP commitments as they are requested. Approximately $38million of these commitments were funded in 2002. As of December31, 2002, the unfunded commitments amounted to $100million. Based on the downgrades made by the rating agencies in October2002, credit support agreements were purchased on January27, 2003, whereby $100million of cash of one of our underwriting subsidiaries has been pledged as collateral for these commitments. These commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments.
If the insurance companies fail to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities as commitments are drawn down, we have guaranteed their purchase.
Subsequent to the closing of the securitization, one of the insurance subsidiaries sold PEPS I fixed-maturity securities with a value of $20million to Aon. The assets and liabilities and operations of PEPS I are not included in our consolidated financial statements. In second quarter 2002, we recognized a $32million impairment write-down for this investment. We continue to monitor this investment for other than temporary impairment.
While this transaction should significantly reduce the reported earnings volatility associated with these limited partnership investments, it will not significantly limit our ability to recoup past losses or realize potential gains.
As part of CICA's strategy to issue stable value investments contracts to institutional investors, Combined Global Funding, LLC (Combined Global), a Cayman Islands-based special purpose entity, was formed solely to issue notes to investors under a European Medium-Term Note Program. The proceeds of the notes are used to purchase Funding Agreement policies issued by CICA. The contract terms of the Funding Agreement mirror the terms of the trust medium-term notes. At the stated maturity of the Funding Agreement, CICA is required to settle with Combined Global, which then redeems the notes issued to investors. Neither CICA nor its affiliates own any shares of Combined Global.
Outstanding Funding Agreements at December31, 2002 were $79million and are included in our consolidated statements of financial position in other policyholder funds. In early 2003, approximately $29million of these outstanding agreements were settled. As this program has been placed in runoff, there are no new additional issuances of Funding Agreements anticipated, with the remaining liabilities maturing in 2005.
45 Investments We invest in broad asset categories related to our diversified operations. In managing our investments, our objective is to maximize earnings while monitoring asset and liability durations, interest and credit risks and regulatory requirements. We maintain well-capitalized operating companies. The financial strength of these companies permits a diversified investment portfolio including invested cash, fixed-income obligations, public and private equities and limited partnerships.
The Corporate and Other segment contains invested assets and related investment income not directly required to support the insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, together with the assets in excess of net policyholder liabilities of the underwriting business and related income. These insurance assets, which are publicly traded equities, as well as less liquid private equities and limited partnerships, represent a more aggressive investment strategy that gives us an opportunity for greater returns with longer-term investments. These assets, owned by the insurance underwriting companies, are necessary to support strong claims paying ratings by independent rating agencies and are unavailable for other uses such as debt reduction or share repurchases without considering regulatory requirements (see note11 to the consolidated financial statements).
Some of the limited partnerships in which we invest have holdings in publicly traded equities. If the market value of these equities changes, then the value of the limited partnerships also changes. Our ownership share of this partnership valuation is included in our reported Corporate and Other segment revenue. By comparison, we record changes in the market value of directly held, publicly traded equities directly in stockholders' equity.
As a consequence of this accounting, the Corporate and Other segment has exhibited greater variability in investment income than is the case of investments supporting the operating segments. In December2001, we securitized $450million of limited partnership investments and associated limited partnership commitments, which represent most of our limited partnership investments, via a sale to PEPS I. The securitization:  gives our underwriting subsidiaries greater liquidity  has lessened the revenue variability in the Corporate and Other segment.
RISKS AND OUTLOOK Risks Related to Our Business and the Insurance Industry Our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries.
Our results historically have been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties in the insurance industry. Changes in premium rates affect not only the potential profitability of our underwriting businesses but also generally affect the commissions and fees payable to our brokerage businesses. In addition, insurance industry developments that can significantly affect our financial performance include factors such as:  rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products;  volatile and unpredictable developments, including weather-related and other natural and man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism;  changes in levels of capacity and demand, including reinsurance capacity; and  changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers' liabilities develop.
46 A further decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.
On several occasions in recent months, the credit rating agencies have lowered the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper. Most recently, on October31, 2002, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating of our senior debt to the current rating of "Baa2" from "Baa1." Moody's also placed the rating of our senior debt and the "P-2" rating of our commercial paper under review for possible future downgrade, which it subsequently removed without change. On October31, 2002, Standard& Poor's Ratings Services placed its "A-" rating of our senior debt on CreditWatch with negative implications, which it subsequently removed without change. As a result of the actions taken by the rating agencies on October31, 2002, we have been required, in lieu of our existing guarantees, to fund an aggregate of approximately $43million with respect to our automobile finance securitizations. A further downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper will increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility.
Any such further downgrade may trigger a further obligation of our company to fund an aggregate of up to $220million with respect to our premium finance and automobile finance securitizations. We no longer securitize automobile finance amounts, and, as a result, we expect this amount will decline over time as the outstanding automobile finance securitizations run down. Moreover, some of our debt instruments, such as our 6.20% notes due January2007 ($250million of which are outstanding), expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades. Similarly, any such downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. If we cannot access the commercial paper market, although we have committed backup lines in excess of our currently outstanding commercial paper borrowings, we cannot assure you that it would not adversely affect our financial position. A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt may also adversely affect the claims-paying ability or financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries. See "A decline in the financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products" below.
We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.
We believe that competition in our lines of business is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, claims paying ability ratings and name recognition. In particular, we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers, brokers and, with respect to our extended warranty business, third-party administrators, manufacturers and distributors.
Some of our underwriting competitors have penetrated more markets and offer a more extensive portfolio of products and services and have more competitive pricing than we do, which can adversely affect our ability to compete for business. Some underwriters also have higher claims paying ability ratings and greater financial resources with which to compete and are subject to less government regulation than our underwriting operations.
We encounter strong competition for both business and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and in other countries and regions, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants that provide risk-related services and products. Our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world.
47 In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:  an increase in capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an influx of capital into the industry;  the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;  the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which, among other things, permits financial institutions, such as banks and savings and loans, to sell insurance products, and also could result in new entrants to our markets;  the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage; and  changes in consumer buying practices caused by the Internet.
New competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of and demand for our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
A decline in the financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products.
Financial strength and claims-paying ability ratings have become increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. These ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies for the purpose of rendering an opinion as to an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. They are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors, nor are they recommendations to buy, sell or hold specific securities. Periodically, the rating agencies evaluate our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to confirm that they continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to them. A downgrade, or the potential for a downgrade, of these ratings could, among other things, increase the number of policy cancellations, adversely affect relationships with brokers, retailers and other distributors of their products and services, negatively impact new sales and adversely affect their ability to compete.
Combined Specialty Insurance Company (formerly Virginia Surety Company,Inc.), our principal property and casualty insurance company subsidiary, is currently rated "A" (excellent; third highest of 16 rating levels) byA.M. Best Company. Combined Insurance Company of America, the principal insurance subsidiary that underwrites our specialty accident and health insurance business, is currently rated "A" (excellent; third highest of 16 rating levels) byA.M. Best Company, "BBB+" (good; fourth highest of nine rating levels and highest ranking within the level) for financial strength by Standard and Poor's Ratings Services and "Baa1" (adequate; fourth highest of nine rating levels and highest ranking within the level) for financial strength by Moody's Investors Service. We cannot assure you that one or more of the rating agencies will not downgrade or withdraw their financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings in the future.
Changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.
Our insurance underwriting subsidiaries carry a substantial investment portfolio of fixed-maturity and equity and other long-term investments. As of December31, 2002, our fixed-maturity investments (94% of which were investment grade) had a carrying value of $2.1billion, our equity investments had a carrying value of $62million and our other long-term investments and limited partnerships had a 48 carrying value of $600million. Accordingly, changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.
For example, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from, and the market value of, fixed-maturity investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our equity investments. We monitor our portfolio for "other than temporary impairments" in carrying value. For securities judged to have an "other than temporary impairment," we recognize a realized loss through the statement of income to write down the value of those securities.
For 2002, we recognized impairment losses of $130million, which includes $51million to reflect other than temporary impairments existing with respect to prior years. We cannot assure you that we will not have to recognize additional impairment losses in the future, which would negatively affect our financial results.
On December31, 2001, our two major insurance companies sold the vast majority of their limited partnership portfolio, valued at $450million, to Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC, a qualifying special purpose entity. We utilized this qualifying special purpose entity following the guidance contained in Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.140 (Statement No.140) and other relevant accounting guidance. The common stock interest in Private Equity Partnership Structures I is held by a limited liability company which is owned by one of our subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which is not controlled by us, established for victims of the September11 attacks (51%). Approximately $171million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities were sold by Private Equity Partnership Structures I to unaffiliated third parties. Private Equity Partnership Structures I then paid our insurance underwriting companies the $171million in cash and issued to them an additional $279million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities. The fixed-maturity securities our insurance underwriting companies received from Private Equity Partnership Structures I are rated as investment grade by Standard& Poor's Ratings Services. As part of this transaction, our insurance underwriting companies are required to purchase from Private Equity Partnership Structures I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, as they are requested. As of December31, 2002, these unfunded commitments amount to $100million. Based on the actions taken by the ratings agencies on October31, 2002, credit support arrangements were purchased on January27, 2003. If our insurance underwriting companies fail to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities as commitments are drawn down, we have guaranteed their purchase.
Although the Private Equity Partnership Structures I transaction is expected to reduce the reported earnings volatility historically associated with directly owning limited partnership investments, it will not eliminate our risk of future losses. For instance, we must analyze our preferred stock and fixed-maturity interests in Private Equity Partnership Structures I for other than temporary impairment, based on the valuation of the limited partnership interests held by Private Equity Partnership Structures I and recognize an impairment loss if necessary. We cannot assure you that we will not have to recognize impairment losses with respect to our Private Equity Partnership Structures I interests in the future.
Our pension liabilities may continue to grow, which could adversely affect our stockholders' equity or require us to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans.
To the extent that the present value of the benefits incurred to date for pension obligations in the major countries in which we operate continue to exceed the market value of the assets supporting these obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. Primarily as a result of the decline in the equity markets, some of our defined benefit pension plans, particularly in the United Kingdom, have suffered significant valuation losses in the assets backing the related pension obligation. On February12, 2003, we announced that we incurred an after-tax increase to the minimum pension liability and a commensurate reduction in 2002year-end stockholders' equity of $552million.
49 Current projections indicate that our 2003 pension expense would increase by approximately $130million compared with 2002 and incremental cash contributions of approximately $40million would be required in 2003. These estimates are based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, fair value of assets for some of our plans and expected return on plan assets. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders' equity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been announced.
We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined adversely to us, would adversely affect our financial results.
We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments and lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages that may be claimed are substantial, including in many instances claims for punitive or extraordinary damages. The litigation naming us as a defendant ordinarily involves our activities as a broker or provider of insurance products or as an employer. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure.
Our success depends, in part, on the efforts of our senior management and our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.
We believe that our continued success depends, in part, on the efforts of our senior management. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriters, brokers and other professional personnel. Competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense. If we cannot hire and retain talented personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We are subject to increasing costs arising from errors and omissions claims against us.
We have experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of errors and omissions claims against us, which has and will continue to substantially increase our risk management expenses. In our insurance brokerage business, we often assist our clients with matters which include the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims. Errors and omissions claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Errors and omissions claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, errors and omissions claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.
Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.
Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or 50 proceedings. With respect to our insurance brokerage businesses, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third-party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third-party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an insurer we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.
Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors. In the United States, this system of regulation, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business, affects the way we can conduct our insurance underwriting business. Furthermore, state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters.
Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, do affect the insurance industry generally and our insurance underwriting subsidiaries in particular. For example, recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation and privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (as it relates to the use of medical and financial information by insurers), may result in additional regulatory compliance costs, limit the ability of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to market their products or otherwise constrain the nature and scope of our operations. With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses, the financial impact of use of capital restrictions and increased training and employee expenses. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.
In all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our businesses can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as they have been in the past.
Our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.
A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:  the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries;  imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; 51  hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;  imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;  longer payment cycles;  greater difficulties in accounts receivables collection; and  the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.
Some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into United States dollars. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.
Our financial results could be adversely affected if our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience.
We maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our insurance underwriting subsidiaries. The reserves that we maintain that could cause variability in our financial results consist of (1)unearned premium reserves, (2)policy and contract claim reserves and (3)future policy benefit reserves. Unearned premium reserves generally reflect our liability to return premiums we have collected under policies in the event of the lapse or cancellation of those policies. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, premiums we have collected generally become "earned" over the life of a policy by means of a reduction in the amount of the unearned premium reserve associated with the policy. Unearned premium reserves are particularly significant with respect to our warranty business, given that the premiums we receive for warranty products generally cover an extended period of time. If there are significant lapses or cancellations of these types of policies, or expected losses for existing policies develop adversely and therefore premiums are not earned as expected, it may be necessary to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition expenses associated with the policies because these deferred expenses are amortized over the projected life of the policies or establish additional reserves to cover premium deficiencies.
Policy and contract claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees and general expenses for administering the claims adjustment process, and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period. If the reserves originally established for future claims prove inadequate, we would be required to increase our liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The obligation for policy and contract claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, where the variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are periodically refined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting the level of reserves for policy and contract claims is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.
52 Future policy benefit reserves generally reflect our liability to provide future life insurance benefits and future accident and health insurance benefits on guaranteed renewable and non-cancelable policies. Future policy benefit reserves on accident and health and life products have been provided on the net level premium method. These reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations.
We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our business transformation plan.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, we began a comprehensive business transformation plan designed to enhance client service, improve productivity through process redesign and accelerate revenue growth. Outside of U.S. retail brokerage, the plan has been substantially implemented and has delivered the expected benefits, including improved revenue growth and enhanced productivity. Within U.S. retail brokerage, however, we experienced unexpected delays in implementing components of the plan, as well as higher than expected costs. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will realize all of the expected benefits associated with our business transformation plan. In addition, regardless of whether we are able to realize any of the benefits of the business transformation plan, we have incurred significant costs, which have been greater than those planned.
The perceived conflicts associated with our insurance brokerage and underwriting businesses could limit our growth.
Historically, we have not been able to fully exploit business opportunities due to the perceived conflicts associated with our insurance brokerage and underwriting businesses. For example, we have refrained from offering our extended warranty products and services through competing insurance brokers. Independent brokers have been reluctant to do business with our insurance underwriting business because they believed that any fees or information provided to us would ultimately benefit our competing brokerage business. These brokers also have been concerned that any information gleaned by our underwriting business regarding their clients and their clients' insurance needs would be shared with our competing brokerage business to solicit new business from these clients. Similarly, competing underwriters have feared that our brokers could share information with our underwriting business in an effort to help secure desirable business or, alternatively, seek price quotes from them only for undesirable business. In the future, these perceived conflicts could limit our ability to expand our product and service offerings and seek new business through independent brokerage channels.
Each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity.
The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions generated by our brokerage business and the premiums generated by our underwriting businesses. In particular, a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Moreover, the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. As our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with us.
Recent and proposed accounting rule changes could negatively affect our financial position and results.
Recent accounting changes effected and proposals made could negatively affect our financial position or results of operations. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.142 (Statement No.142), which we adopted on January1, 2002, goodwill is no longer being amortized, but 53 must instead be tested annually for impairment in its value. Goodwill is the excess of cost over net assets purchased relating to business acquisitions. As of December31, 2002, we had approximately $4.1billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. If an impairment exists, we must recognize a non-cash charge equal to the impairment, thereby reducing our net worth. Under our principal credit facility that supports our commercial paper program, we are required to maintain a minimum net worth of $2.5billion. As of December31, 2002, our net worth calculated for this purpose was $3.9billion. In connection with our adoption of Statement No.142 we tested our goodwill and found no impairment as of January1, 2002. We have finalized our testing for 2002 and found no impairment. However, we cannot assure you that impairment will not exist when we perform testing in future periods, and any impairment charge we would be required to take would have a negative effect on our financial position and results.
We have substantial debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.
We have substantial debt outstanding. As of December31, 2002, we had total consolidated debt outstanding (including for this purpose our mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities) of approximately $2.5billion. This substantial amount of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility.
We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts.
Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries, including our insurance underwriting companies. We have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses. Payments from our underwriting subsidiaries are limited by governmental regulation and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries. In some circumstances, specific payments from our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may require prior regulatory approval, and we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in the amounts we anticipate or require.
The volume of premiums we write and our profitability are affected by the availability of reinsurance and the size and adequacy of our insurance company subsidiaries' capital base.
The level of business that our insurance underwriting subsidiaries are able to write depends on the size and adequacy of their capital base. Many state insurance laws to which they are subject impose risk-based capital requirements for purposes of regulating insurer solvency. Insurers having less statutory surplus than that required by the risk-based capital model formula generally are subject to varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and intervention depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December31, 2002, each of our insurance company subsidiaries met the risk-based statutory surplus requirements of every state in which it conducts business.
We purchase reinsurance for certain of the risks underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which may affect the level of business we are able to write and our profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or that we can obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could adversely affect our underwriting business.
54 We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all.
To better manage our portfolio of underwriting risk, we may, from time to time, purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we will assume (known as ceding) to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium that we will receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance would make the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk were transferred (or ceded) to the reinsurer, it would not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we will bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, if any. Recently, due to industry and general economic conditions, there is an increasing risk of insolvency among reinsurance companies, resulting in a greater incidence of litigation and affecting the recoverability of claims. We cannot assure you that our reinsurers, if any, will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis.
Information Concerning Forward-looking Statements This report contains certain statements relating to future results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results, depending on a variety of factors. Potential factors that could impact results include the general economic conditions in different countries around the world, fluctuations in global equity and fixed income markets, exchange rates, rating agency actions, pension funding, changes in commercial property and casualty markets and commercial premium rates, the competitive environment, the actual costs of resolution of contingent liabilities and other loss contingencies, the heightened level of potential errors and omissions liability arising from placements of complex policies and sophisticated reinsurance arrangements in an insurance market in which insurer reserves are under pressure, the ultimate impact of the business transformation plan, and the timing and resolution of related insurance and reinsurance issues relating to the events of September11, 2001.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Previously Planned Divestiture of Insurance Underwriting Businesses and Discontinuance of Certain Operations As previously discussed, in fourth quarter 2002, we announced our plans to sell Sheffield Insurance Corporation, a small property-casualty company. In March2003, we completed the sale.
Capital Enhancement Actions As previously discussed, we received approximately $223million ($225million aggregate principal amount) by privately placing 7.375% senior notes in the fourth quarter 2002. In March2003, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the offer to exchange these notes for registered notes having identical terms.
BTA Litigation On February27, 2003, oral arguments were held before the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the action filed by reinsurers in the U.K., the court decided that it should wait until at least June2003 to allow determination of the outcome of the U.S. appeal.
Other Items In February2003, our insurance subsidiaries transferred, for appropriate consideration, shares of Endurance Specialty Insurance,Ltd., to other subsidiaries of Aon of approximately $75million.
55 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Market Risk Exposure We are subject to various market risk exposures, including foreign exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risk. The following disclosures reflect estimates of future performance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ.
We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk associated with translating financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Additionally, some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our primary exposures are to the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We use various derivative financial instruments (see note14 to the consolidated financial statements) to protect against adverse transaction and translation effects of exchange rate fluctuations.
The potential decrease to our consolidated stockholders' equity at December31, 2002, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted year-end foreign currency exchange rates, amounts to $207million and $163million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The impact to 2002 and 2001 pretax income in the event of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the respective quoted year-end exchange rates would not be material after consideration of derivative positions.
The nature of the income of our businesses is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. A hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $14million and $10million to 2002 and 2001 pretax income, respectively.
The valuation of our fixed-maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 1% increase in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of the portfolio at December31, 2002 and 2001 by approximately $85million and $89million, respectively. We have notes payable and capital securities outstanding with a fair value of $2.4billion and $2.5billion at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Such fair value was greater than the carrying value by $36million and $38million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value by approximately 6% at both December31, 2002 and 2001.
The valuation of our marketable equity security portfolio is subject to equity price risk. If market prices were to decrease by 10%, the fair value of the equity portfolio would have a corresponding decrease of $6million at December31, 2002 compared to $38million at December31, 2001. At December31, 2002 and 2001, there were no outstanding derivatives hedging the price risk on the equity portfolio.
We have selected the value ranges to represent changes in foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices only to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events. This range of changes reflects changes we believe are possible over a one-year period.
The translated value of revenue and expense from our international brokerage and underwriting operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, the net impact of these fluctuations on Aon's net income or cash flows has not been material.
56 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Report of Ernst& Young LLP, Independent Auditors Board of Directors and Stockholders Aon Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Aon Corporation as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules as listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Aon Corporation at December31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note1, in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and in 2000 the Company changed its method of accounting for certain commission and fee revenue and also changed its method of accounting for derivative financial instruments.
/s/ Ernst& Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February12, 2003 57 Report By Management Management of Aon Corporation is responsible for the fairness of presentation and integrity of the financial statements and other financial information in the annual report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These statements include informed estimates and judgments for those transactions not yet complete or for which the ultimate effects cannot be measured precisely. Financial information elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been audited by our independent auditors. Their role is to render an independent professional opinion on Aon's financial statements.
Management maintains a system of internal control designed to meet its responsibilities for reliable financial statements. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate costs, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management's authorization. Judgments are required to assess and balance the relative costs and expected benefits of those controls. It is management's opinion that its system of internal control as of December31, 2002 was effective in providing reasonable assurance that its financial statements were free of material misstatement. In addition, management supports and maintains a professional staff of internal auditors who coordinate audit coverage with the independent auditors and conduct a program of financial and operational audits.
The Board of Directors selects an Audit Committee from among its members. All members of the Audit Committee are independent of the Company. The Audit Committee recommends to the Board of Directors appointment of the independent auditors and provides oversight relating to the review of financial information provided to stockholders and others, the systems of internal control which management and the Board of Directors have established and the audit process. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management, internal auditors and independent auditors to review the work of each and satisfy itself that those parties are properly discharging their responsibilities. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee, without the presence of management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control and to review the quality of financial reporting.

62 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries (Aon). These statements include informed estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from the amounts reported. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Brokerage Commissions and Fees Commission income is recognized at the later of the billing or effective date of the policy. However, in circumstances where a binding order has been received before the end of the accounting period and coverage is effective, but processing has not yet occurred in the billing system due to timing, an accrual is recorded. The amounts recorded for these accruals are generally consistent from period to period and the total accrual has not materially impacted the historical trend of revenue and earnings in any quarterly or annual period. Aon's policy for estimating allowances for return commissions on policy cancellations is to record an allowance based on a historical evaluation of cancellations as a percentage of related revenue. Certain life insurance commissions, commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance companies and certain other carrier compensation are generally recognized as income when received. Revenues may be recorded in advance of the cash receipts in cases where the amounts due to be received have been confirmed by the insurance company, or when Aon has sufficient information in its records to estimate amounts for premium based revenue accruals in accordance with agreements Aon has with insurance carriers. Commissions on premium adjustments are recognized as they occur.
Fees for claims services, benefit consulting, human capital outsourcing, reinsurance services and other services are recognized when the services are rendered. Aon may enter into multiple year outsourcing agreements with clients. Revenues received from these agreements are recorded on a gross basis, inclusive of amounts ultimately passed through to subcontractors, when Aon maintains the performance obligation, and are recorded ratably over the life of the contract. The portion of the revenues received on extended warranty contracts that are for the marketing, administration and servicing of those contracts are reported as earned consistent with the method used to earn the premium portion of those revenues, and revenues that represent administrative fee-for-service arrangements for which Aon does not bear the underwriting risk, are earned as those services are performed. These fee-for-service arrangements include the marketing and servicing of extended warranty contracts on behalf of other companies and brokerage commissions for accident and health products placed with non-Aon insurance carriers.
Premium Revenue For accident and health products, premiums are reported as earned in proportion to insurance protection provided over the period covered by the policies. For life products, premiums are recognized as revenue when due. For extended warranty products, premium revenues represent the portion of revenue from these contracts that are submitted to an Aon insurance carrier for coverage and are earned over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises .
For universal life-type and investment products, generally there is no requirement for payment of premium other than to maintain account values at a level sufficient to pay mortality and expense 63 charges. Consequently, premiums for universal life-type policies and investment products are not reported as revenue, but as deposits. Policy fee revenue for universal life-type policies and investment products consists of charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration and surrenders assessed during the period. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit claims incurred in excess of policy account balances.
Unusual Charges (Credits)World Trade Center In 2001, Aon recorded pretax unusual charges of $158million ($97million after-tax or $0.35 per dilutive share), net of insurance and reinsurance recoveries, related to losses sustained as a result of the destruction of the World Trade Center on September11, 2001 and the death of 175 employees. Costs incurred included $33million of destroyed depreciable assets at net book value, $40million for salaries and benefits for deceased and injured employees and other costs, and a $10million commitment to the Aon Memorial Education fund to support the educational needs of the children of Aon employees who were victims of the September11 th attacks. Offsetting these expenses were estimated insurance recoveries of $60million as of fourth quarter 2001. These costs also included $192million of insurance benefits paid by Aon's Combined Insurance Company of America subsidiary (CICA) under life insurance policies issued for the benefit of deceased employees, which were partially offset by reinsurance recoveries of $147million, resulting in a net charge of $45million. Reinsurers have disputed their liability as to approximately $90million of reinsurance recoveries under a Business Travel Accident (BTA) policy issued by CICA to cover U.S.-based employees of subsidiaries of Aon, and legal actions have been filed by both parties. In fourth quarter 2001, Aon recorded a pretax $90million allowance for a potentially uncollectible receivable related to this dispute. In September2002, CICA's action with respect to the BTA policy was dismissed by the Court for the lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Prior to year-end, CICA was granted an expedited appeal.
During 2002, a settlement was reached with Aon's property insurance carriers pertaining to reimbursement for depreciable assets destroyed. This settlement resulted in a pretax credit of $29million, which is reported as an Unusual creditWorld Trade Center in the consolidated statements of income. Additional claims are in the process of being presented to other insurers for issues related to extra expenses, leasehold interests and business interruption coverage and additional recoveries and gains are expected in future periods when specific claims are settled.
Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums, commissions and expense reimbursements on reinsured business are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Premiums and benefits to policyholders ceded to other companies have been reported as a reduction of premium revenue and benefits to policyholders. Expense reimbursements received in connection with reinsurance ceded have been accounted for as a reduction of the related policy acquisition costs. Reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premium amounts are reported as assets.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Aon's policy for estimating allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to receivables is to record an allowance based on a historical evaluation of write-offs, aging of balances and other qualitative and quantitative analyses.
Stock Compensation Plans Aon applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans.
64 Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock option plan as the exercise price of the options equaled the market price of the stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense has been recognized for stock awards based on the market price at the date of the award.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Aon had applied the fair value recognition provision of FASB Statement No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , to stock-based employee compensation.
Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Net income, as reported $ 466 $ 147 $ 474 Add: Stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 14 19 16 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 37 29 32 Pro forma net income $ 443 $ 137 $ 458 Net income per share: Basic As reported $ 1.65 $ 0.54 $ 1.81 Pro forma 1.57 0.51 1.75 Dilutive As reported 1.64 0.53 1.79 Pro forma 1.56 0.50 1.73 The fair value per share of options and awards granted is estimated as $6.21 and $28.54 in 2002, $8.66 and $29.78 in 2001 and $6.33 and $25.73 in 2000, respectively, on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2002 2001 2000 Dividend yield 2.25 % 2.0 % 2.0 % Expected volatility 21 % 28 % 27 % Risk-free interest rate 4 % 6 % 6 % Expected term life beyond vesting date (in years): Stock options 0.96 1.06 0.94 Stock awards    The compensation cost as generated by the Black-Scholes model may not be indicative of the future benefit, if any, that may be received by the option holder.
The pro forma information reflected above may not be representative of the amounts to be expected in future years as the fair value method of accounting contained in FASB Statement No.123 has not been applied to options and awards granted prior to January1995.
Income Tax Deferred income tax has been provided for the effects of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and has been measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect.
Income Per Share Basic income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, excluding any dilutive effects of options and awards. Net income available for common 65 stockholders is net of all preferred dividends. Dilutive income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of options and awards. The dilutive effect of options and awards is calculated under the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period. Common stock equivalents related to options to purchase 24million, 4million and 5million shares of Aon common stock in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, have not been considered because they would have been anti-dilutive. Income per share is calculated as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (millions except per share data) Net income $ 466 $ 147 $ 474 Redeemable preferred stock dividends (3 ) (3 ) (3 ) Net income available for common stockholders $ 463 $ 144 $ 471 Basic shares outstanding 281 269 260 Common stock equivalents 2 3 3 Dilutive potential common shares 283 272 263 Net income per share: Basic $ 1.65 $ 0.54 $ 1.81 Dilutive $ 1.64 $ 0.53 $ 1.79 Investments Short-term investments include certificates of deposit and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturities of up to one year (generally three months or less) and money market funds and are carried at cost which approximates fair value.
Fixed-maturity securities are available for sale and are carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts to maturity that are included in investment income. Marketable equity securities that are held directly are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and temporary unrealized losses on fixed-maturities and directly-held equity securities are excluded from income and are recorded directly to stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income taxes. Mortgage loans and policy loans are generally carried at cost or unpaid principal balance. Private equity investments are generally carried at cost, which approximates fair value, except where Aon has significant influence, in which case they are carried under the equity method. In 2001, Aon announced that it would co-sponsor a new Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance company with total initial capitalization of $1.2billion to provide additional underwriting capacity to commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance clients. Aon's investment in Endurance Specialty InsuranceLtd. (Endurance) was funded in December2001 with $227million of operating cash. The investment in Endurance is carried under the equity method and is included in Other Investments in the consolidated statements of financial position.
Limited partnership investments are carried under the equity method. Certain of the limited partnerships in which Aon invests have holdings in publicly traded equities. Changes in market value of these indirectly-held equities flow through the limited partnerships' financial statements. Aon's ownership share of these valuation changes is included in Aon's Corporate and Other Segment revenue.
In December2001, Aon securitized $450million of limited partnership investments, plus associated limited partnership commitments, via a sale to Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC (PEPS I).
66 Aon received $171million in cash plus $279million of newly-issued fixed maturity and preferred stock securities of PEPS I. The underlying equity in the limited partnerships was the basis for determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization. No significant management assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the cash and securities received in the securitization or the value at December31, 2002. At December31, 2002, a 10% or 20% decrease in the underlying equity of the limited partnerships would have resulted in a decrease in the value of the preferred stock securities owned by $40million and $80million, respectively.
Income or loss on disposal of any securities held in the portfolio is computed using specific costs of securities sold and reported as investment income in the consolidated statements of income.
Declines in the fair value of invested assets below cost are evaluated for other than temporary impairment losses on a quarterly basis. Impairment losses for declines in value of fixed-maturity investments and equity securities below cost attributable to issuer-specific events are based upon all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, FASB Statement No.115 and related guidance. For fixed-maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry-related events where Aon has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity, declines in value below cost are assumed to be temporary.
Aon's policy for equity securities is to recognize impairment losses on specific securities that have had continuous material unrealized losses for more than three consecutive quarters or less, due to market conditions or industry-related events.
Reserves for certain other investments are established based on an evaluation of the respective investment portfolio and current economic conditions. Write-downs and changes in reserves are included in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. In general, Aon ceases to accrue investment income when interest or dividend payments are in arrears.
Accounting policies relating to derivative financial instruments are discussed in note14.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Costs of acquiring new and renewal insurance underwriting business, principally the excess of new commissions over renewal commissions, underwriting and sales expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business, are deferred and reported as assets. For long-duration life and health products, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is related to and based on the expected premium revenues of the policies. In general, amortization is adjusted to reflect current withdrawal experience. Expected premium revenues are estimated by using the same assumptions used in estimating future policy benefits. For extended warranty and short-duration health insurance, costs of acquiring and renewing business are deferred and amortized as the related premiums and contract fees are earned.
Intangible Assets In general, prior to January1, 2002, goodwill relating to business acquisitions had been amortized into income over periods not exceeding 40years using the straight-line method. Goodwill related to acquisitions made after June30, 2001 has not been amortized. Beginning January2002, goodwill was not amortized but instead tested for impairment under new authoritative guidance on business combinations and goodwill. See Accounting and Disclosure Changes (note1) for further information. The cost of other intangible assets is being amortized over a range of 1 to 10years with a weighted-average life of 3.8years.
67 In the unexpected event of a significant deterioration in profitability that is projected to be recurring, Aon would assess the recoverability of its intangible assets through an analysis of expected future cash flows.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Included in this category is internal use software, which is software that is acquired, internally developed or modified solely to meet internal needs, with no plan to market externally. Costs related to directly obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software are capitalized. These costs are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a range of 2 to 10years. The weighted- average life of Aon's software at December31, 2002 is 4.7years.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair values for financial instruments. The carrying amounts in the consolidated statements of financial position for cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, approximate their fair value. Fair value for fixed-maturity and equity securities is based on quoted market prices or, if they are not actively traded, on estimated values obtained from independent pricing services. Fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments or the cost to terminate or offset with other contracts.
Other investments are comprised of mortgage loans, policy loans, private equity investments, limited partnerships and Aon's investment in Endurance. The fair value for mortgage loans and policy loans is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. It is generally not practical to estimate the fair value of private equity investments and limited partnerships without incurring excessive costs.
Fair value for liabilities for investment-type contracts is estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. The fair value for notes payable is based on quoted market prices for the publicly-traded portion and on estimates using discounted cash flow analyses based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements for the nonpublicly-traded portion.
Future Policy Benefits, Policy and Contract Claims, Unearned Premiums and Contract Fees Future policy benefit liabilities on non-universal life and accident and health products have been provided on the net level premium method. The liabilities are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations. Interest assumptions are graded and range from 4.5% to 7.0% at December31, 2002. Withdrawal assumptions are based principally on insurance subsidiaries' experience and vary by plan, year of issue and duration.
Policyholder liabilities on universal life and investment products are generally based on policy account values. Interest credit rates for these products range from 2% to 7.3%.
Policy and contract claim liabilities represent estimates for reported claims, as well as provisions for losses incurred, but not yet reported. These claim liabilities are based on historical experience and are estimates of the ultimate amount to be paid when the claims are settled. Changes in the estimated liability are reflected in income as the estimates are revised.
Unearned premiums and contract fees generally are calculated using the pro rata method based on gross premiums. However, in the case of extended warranty and credit life and disability products, the 68 unearned premiums and contract fees are calculated such that the premiums and contract fees are earned over the period of risk in a reasonable relationship to anticipated claims.
Foreign Currency Translation In general, foreign revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Foreign assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Net foreign exchange gains and losses on translation are generally reported in stockholders' equity, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income tax. The effect of transaction gains and losses on the consolidated statements of income, after consideration of derivative hedging, is insignificant for all periods presented.
Accounting and Disclosure Changes As of October1, 2000, Aon adopted FASB Statement No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended. The adoption of Statement No.133 resulted in a $5million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle before applicable income taxes of $2million and was recognized as an decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss (note3) in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for the year ended December31, 2000. The adoption of Statement No.133 did not have a material effect on net income for the year ended December31, 2000. Refer to note14 for a description of accounting policies relating to derivative financial instruments.
In December1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued SAB No.101, which provides guidance for applying generally accepted accounting principles relating to the timing of revenue recognition in financial statements filed with the SEC. Effective January1, 2000, in accordance with the provisions of SAB No.101, Aon established a provision for estimated returned commissions from policy cancellations. In 1999 and previous years, Aon recognized returned commissions when they occurred. The cumulative effect of this accounting change was an after-tax charge of $7million or $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2000. Previously reported results for the remaining quarters of 2000 were not impacted by this accounting change.
In September2000, the FASB issued Statement No.140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.
Statement No.140 replaces Statement No.125 and revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures. Statement No.140 became effective for all transfers of financial assets occurring after March31, 2001. Implementation of Statement No.140 did not have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements.
In June2001, the FASB issued Statement No.141, Business Combinations , and Statement No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Statement No.141 superceded APB Opinion No.16, and amended or superceded a number of interpretations of APB No.16. Certain purchase accounting guidance in APB No.16, as well as certain of its amendments and interpretations, have been carried forward. The statement eliminated the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations. It also changed the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill. The requirements of Statement No.141 were effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that was completed after June30, 2001. Statement No.142 supercedes APB No.17. Under Statement No.142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, for impairment. Separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The amortization provisions of Statement No.142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June30, 2001. With respect to goodwill acquired prior to July1, 2001, amortization was discontinued effective as of January1, 2002. Reported goodwill amortization was $118million and $114million for the years ended December2001 and 2000, respectively.
69 In accordance with Statement No.141, other intangible assets which resulted from acquisitions made prior to July1, 2001, that did not meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill (as defined by Statement No.141) were to be classified as goodwill upon adoption of the statement. Accordingly, Aon has reclassified $287million of these intangibles, net of accumulated amortization, to goodwill as of January1, 2002. Amounts on the December31, 2001 consolidated statement of financial position have been reclassified for this item. In addition, Aon re-examined the useful lives of all intangibles in accordance with Statement No.142. Reported amortization expense for all other intangibles was $54million, $40million and $40million for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
In August2001, the FASB issued Statement No.144 , Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . Statement No.144 supercedes Statement No.121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of , and provides new rules on asset impairment and a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of. Although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of Statement No.121, the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held-for-sale. The new rules also supercede the provisions of APB No.30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions , with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period(s) in which the losses are incurred. Statement No.144 was effective January1, 2002. This statement did not have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements.
In June2002, the FASB issued Statement No.146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities . Statement No.146 supercedes Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) . Statement No.146 is effective January1, 2003. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements.
In November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No.45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). Guarantees meeting the characteristics described in FIN 45 are required to be initially recorded at fair value, which is different from the general current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in FASB Statement No.5, Accounting for Contingencies .
FIN 45's disclosure requirements are applicable for each guarantee, or each group of similar guarantees, even if the likelihood of the guarantor having to make payments is remote.
FIN 45's disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after December15, 2002. Aon's disclosures may be found in note14. FIN 45's initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. Implementation of this Interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on Aon's consolidated financial statements.
In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). This interpretation clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No.51, Consolidated Financial Statements , to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 identifies circumstances in which the consolidation decision should be based on voting interests and other circumstances in which the consolidation decision should be based on variable interests. FIN 46's 70 disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after January31, 2003. Aon's disclosures may be found in note14.
The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for variable interest entities created after January31, 2003, and are effective for existing variable interest entities no later than the beginning of the first interim reporting period beginning after June15, 2003. Aon has not yet determined the effect, if any, this statement will have on the consolidated financial statements.
Previously Planned Divestiture of Underwriting Business In April2001, Aon's Board of Directors approved a preliminary plan to spin off its insurance underwriting businesses to Aon's common stockholders, creating two independent, publicly traded companies. In August2002, Aon announced it was no longer planning to spin off all the underwriting businesses, but was considering a sale or partial spin-off. At that time, a prompt sale of all or part of the underwriting operations, at an acceptable price, was believed to be achievable within a reasonable timeframe. However, due to adverse market conditions for mergers and acquisitions, Aon announced in October2002 that it had decided not to sell, or spin off, its major underwriting subsidiaries. In fourth quarter 2002, Aon announced its plans to sell Sheffield Insurance Corporation, a small property-casualty company.
In 2002, Aon incurred approximately $50million of pretax expenses associated with its prior spin-off plans and related initiatives that will not be pursued. These expenses, recorded primarily in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income, represent staff build-up and severance costs, corporate overhead and advisory fees and costs tied to an anticipated, but now abandoned, expansion of certain specialty property and casualty underwriting.
Reclassification Certain amounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.
71 2.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with FASB Statement No.142, all of Aon's goodwill will no longer be amortized. Goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to various reporting units, which are either at its operating segments or one reporting level below the operating segment. In prior years, goodwill amortization has been systematically expensed in the Corporate and Other segment. Statement No.142 requires Aon to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value at the valuation date, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the recorded amount of goodwill. Fair value is estimated based on various valuation metrics.
In first quarter 2002, Aon completed its initial impairment review that indicated that there was no impairment as of January1, 2002. In fourth quarter 2002, Aon completed its annual impairment review that affirmed that there was no impairment as of October1, 2002 (the annual evaluation date).
A reconciliation of net income for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000 to adjusted net income had Statement No.142 and the reclassification provisions of Statement No.141 been applicable for all periods presented follows: Year Ended December 31, 2001 Year Ended December 31, 2000 Amount Basic Net Income Per Share Dilutive Net Income Per Share Amount Basic Net Income Per Share Dilutive Net Income Per Share (millions, except per share data) Reported net income $ 147 $ 0.54 $ 0.53 $ 474 $ 1.81 $ 1.79 Add back amortization (net of tax): Goodwill 104 0.38 0.38 98 0.37 0.37 Intangible assets reclassified to goodwill 10 0.04 0.04 10 0.04 0.04 Less amortization (net of tax): Other intangible assetschange in amortization periods (5 ) (0.02 ) (0.02 ) (5 ) (0.02 ) (0.02 ) $ 256 $ 0.94 $ 0.93 $ 577 $ 2.20 $ 2.18 The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December31, 2002 are as follows: Insurance Brokerage and Other Services Consulting Insurance Underwriting Total (millions) Balance as of December 31, 2001 $ 3,239 $ 366 $ 237 $ 3,842 Goodwill acquired during the period 58 5  63 Foreign currency revaluation 190 1 3 194 Balance as of December 31, 2002 $ 3,487 $ 372 $ 240 $ 4,099 72 Amortizable intangible assets by asset class follow: Customer Related and Contract Based Present Value of Future Profits Marketing, Technology and Other Total (millions) As of December 31, 2002 Gross carrying amount $ 225 $ 76 $ 162 $ 463 Accumulated amortization 148 24 66 238 Net carrying amount $ 77 $ 52 $ 96 $ 225 As of December 31, 2001 Gross carrying amount $ 237 $ 83 $ 92 $ 412 Accumulated amortization 151 3 16 170 Net carrying amount $ 86 $ 80 $ 76 $ 242 Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for the years ending December31, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 is estimated to be $50million, $43million, $37million, $26million and $11million, respectively.

In these transactions, Aon paid an aggregate of approximately $111million in cash and $3million in common stock. Internal funds, short-term borrowings and common stock financed the acquisitions. Goodwill of approximately $51million and other intangible assets of approximately $48million, accounted for on a preliminary basis, resulted from these acquisitions.
With respect to certain acquisitions, Aon is contingently liable to issue additional shares based on the occurrence of future events which would increase the purchase price of certain acquisitions. Approximately 230,000 shares were contingently issuable at December31, 2002 related to current and prior year acquisitions. In January2003, approximately 173,000 shares were issued in relation to a prior year acquisition.
In 2001, Aon acquired ASI Solutions Incorporated (ASI), a worldwide provider of human resource outsourcing and compensation consulting services, and First Extended,Inc. (FEI), an underwriter and administrator of automotive extended warranty products, and certain other insurance brokerage and consulting operations. In these transactions, Aon paid an aggregate of approximately $107million in cash and $197million in common stock. Internal funds, short-term borrowings and common stock financed the acquisitions. Goodwill of approximately $282million and other intangible assets of approximately $72million, resulted from these acquisitions.
In July2001, Aon acquired the common stock of two entities controlled by Aon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The acquisition was financed by the issuance of approximately 22.4million shares of Aon common stock. The two acquired entities owned, in the aggregate, approximately 22.4million shares of Aon common stock, which are included in treasury stock, and had additional net assets, net of expenses, totaling $5million. This transaction did not have a material effect on Aon's total assets, liabilities or stockholders' equity.
In 2000, Aon acquired Actuarial Sciences Associates,Inc., Horizon Consulting Group,Inc., and certain other insurance brokerage and consulting operations for approximately $85million in cash and $145million in common stock. Internal funds, short-term borrowings and common stock financed the acquisitions. Goodwill of approximately $225million resulted from these acquisitions.
The results of operations of these acquisitions, all of which were accounted for by the purchase method, are included in the consolidated financial statements from the dates they were acquired. Pro forma results of these acquisitions are not materially different from reported results. In accordance with a 1992 purchase agreement, securities with a value of $41million, previously held under an escrow agreement (as amended), were released. All current balances with Aon were settled.
Restructuring charges In 2002, Aon made payments of $12million on restructuring charges and purchase accounting liabilities related to business combinations.
In 1996 and 1997, Aon recorded pretax special charges of $60million and $145million, respectively, related to management's commitment to a formal plan of restructuring Aon's brokerage operations as a result of the acquisition of Alexander& Alexander Services,Inc. (A&A). Also in 1997, following management's commitment to a formal plan of restructuring the A&A and Bain Hogg brokerage operations, Aon recorded $264million in costs to restructure those acquisitions. Together, these costs were primarily related to termination benefits of $152million, lease abandonments and other exit costs of $280million, and asset impairments of $37million relating to the abandonment of systems and real estate space. All termination benefits have been paid. The remaining liability of 75 $51million is for lease abandonments and other exit costs, and is being paid out over several years as planned.
The following table sets forth the activity related to these liabilities: (millions) Balance at December 31, 1999 $ 105 Cash payments in 2000 (25 ) Charge to expense in 2000 4 Foreign currency revaluation (6 ) Balance at December 31, 2000 78 Cash payments in 2001 (19 ) Foreign currency revaluation (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2001 58 Cash payments in 2002 (11 ) Foreign currency revaluation 4 Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 51 All of Aon's unpaid liabilities relating to acquisitions are reflected in general expense liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.
5.Business Transformation Plan In fourth quarter 2000, after final approval by its Board of Directors, Aon began a comprehensive business transformation plan designed to enhance client service, improve productivity through process redesign and accelerate growth. Costs of the plan include special charges and transition costs. In connection with the overall plan and strategic initiatives, Aon recorded total net expenses of $294million, of which $6million of income, $218million of expenses and $82million of expenses were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are reflected in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
In 2000, expenses included costs related to termination benefits of $54million, covering notification to 750 employees. Other costs to exit an activity of $6million were incurred, which included $2million for abandoned leases and $4million for direct costs necessary to complete portions of the business transformation plan and cash settlement necessary to exit contractual obligations. Other expenses of $22million were also recorded in 2000, including fixed asset impairments of $20million (of which $16million related to information systems assets), as well as $2million of other costs.
For 2001, expenses included costs related to termination benefits of $109million, covering notification to 3,150 employees. Other costs to exit an activity of $21million were incurred, which included $10million for abandoned leases and $11million for direct costs necessary to complete portions of the business transformation plan and cash settlements necessary to exit contractual obligations.
Other expenses of $88million were recorded in 2001. A subsidiary of Aon has acted as a servicing agent for a limited partnership affiliated with automobile dealerships to provide auto financing to dealerships on a cooperative basis through various financing conduit facilities. This subsidiary also has a general partnership interest in the limited partnership. Continued competition from financing provided by the financing arms of automobile manufacturers caused Aon to evaluate whether it wished to continue in this servicing partner relationship. In first quarter 2001, Aon elected to cease servicing new business and run off its existing service obligation. The limited partnership affiliated with automobile dealerships established allowances for uncollectible loan balances. In conjunction with the decision to discontinue new auto financing receivables, the limited partners are not obligated to contribute 76 additional capital beyond what they have already provided for any shortfall in the reserves for their individual book of business. Aon is required to fund any shortfalls in accordance with Aon's limited recourse to the funding facility arranged by the servicing agent. The servicing agent estimated the liability that Aon would have for the existing shortfall at the time Aon decided to discontinue new auto loan financing under the facility. Aon recorded a charge to establish this obligation in accordance with FASB Statement No.5, which amounted to an expense of $44million. For the year 2000, the last full year of operation, these servicing operations, which were part of Aon's Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment, generated revenue of $42million and pretax income of $3million.
During 2001 Aon exited four other joint venture operations as a part of its business transformation process. For the year 2000, the last full year of operation, these joint ventures, which were part of Aon's Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment, generated less than $1million of revenue and incurred nearly $3million of pretax losses. The total cost to exit these four joint ventures was $12million. Additional expenses in 2001 included a provision of $14million for discontinuing supplemental accident and health insurance business operations in Mississippi. The expense included severance costs and expenses associated with the reassignment of agents, as well as estimated costs for resolving asserted and unasserted claims and suits. A $5million expense was recorded relating to the write-down of certain agent receivables in conjunction with the restructuring of a worksite marketing agent commission pay structure and operations.
Further fixed asset impairments of $10million (of which $9million related to information systems assets) were taken in 2001, as well as $3million of other costs.
In the second quarter 2002, $6million of pretax costs previously incurred in connection with the business transformation plan in the U.S. were reversed and included as a credit to general expenses.
Approximately 3,700 employees have either departed voluntarily or have positions that have been eliminated. Most of the terminations have occurred and are related to the Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment in the U.S. and the U.K.
The following table sets forth the activity related to the liability for termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity: Termination Benefits Other Costs to Exit an Activity Total (millions) Expense charged in 2000 $ 54 $ 6 $ 60 Cash payments in 2000 (13 ) (3 ) (16 ) Balance at December 31, 2000 41 3 44 Expense charged in 2001 109 21 130 Cash payments in 2001 (73 ) (20 ) (93 ) Foreign currency revaluation (2 )  (2 ) Balance at December 31, 2001 75 4 79 Credit to expense in 2002 (6 )  (6 ) Cash payments in 2002 (46 ) (3 ) (49 ) Foreign currency revaluation 4  4 Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 27 $ 1 $ 28 All of Aon's unpaid liabilities relating to business transformation plan are reflected in general expense liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Termination benefits of $15million and $2million are expected to be paid in 2003 and 2004, respectively, with the remainder payable thereafter.
77 6.Discontinued Operations Prior to its acquisition by Aon, A&A discontinued its property and casualty insurance underwriting operations in 1985, some of which were then placed into run-off, with the remainder sold in 1987. In connection with those sales, A&A provided indemnities to the purchaser for various estimated and potential liabilities, including provisions to cover future losses attributable to insurance pooling arrangements, a stop-loss reinsurance agreement and actions or omissions by various underwriting agencies previously managed by an A&A subsidiary.
In January2002, Aon settled certain of these liabilities. The settlement had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As of December31, 2002, the liabilities associated with the foregoing indemnities were included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Such liabilities amounted to $48million, net of reinsurance recoverables and other assets of $101million.
The insurance liabilities represent estimates of known and future claims expected to be settled over the next 20 to 30years, principally with regards to asbestos, pollution and health hazard exposures.
Although these insurance liabilities represent a best estimate of the probable liabilities, adverse developments may occur given the nature of the information available and the variables inherent in the estimation processes. Based on current estimates, management believes that the established liabilities of discontinued operations are sufficient.
78 7.Investments The components of investment income are as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Short-term investments $ 131 $ 191 $ 214 Fixed maturities: Interest income 118 137 172 Income on disposals 51 37 13 Losses on disposals(1) (33 ) (21 ) (12 ) Total 136 153 173 Equity securities: Dividend income 15 25 31 Income on disposals 3 13 28 Losses on disposals(1) (63 ) (37 ) (9 ) Total (45 ) 1 50 Limited partnershipsequity earnings 14 (94 ) 73 Other investments: Interest, dividend and other income 40 10 11 Endurance Specialtyequity earnings 21   Losses on disposals(1) (39 ) (41 ) (5 ) Total 22 (31 ) 6 Gross investment income 258 220 516 Less: investment expenses 6 7 8 Investment income $ 252 $ 213 $ 508 (1) Includes impairment write-downs of $130million, $57million and $10million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Securities on deposit for regulatory authorities as required by law, all relating to the insurance underwriting subsidiaries, amounted to $343million at December31, 2002 and $290million at December31, 2001. Aon maintains premium trust bank accounts for premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies of $2.8billion and $2.3billion at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
At December31, 2002 and 2001, Aon had $129million and $25million, respectively, of non-income producing investments, which excludes private equity investments carried on the equity method, held for at least twelve months, that have not declared dividends during 2002 and 2001.
Limited Partnership Securitization.
On December31, 2001, Aon sold the vast majority of its limited partnership (LP) portfolio, valued at $450million, to PEPS I, a Qualified Special Purpose Entity (QSPE). The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company which is owned by one of Aon's subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which is not controlled by Aon, established for victims of the September11 th attacks (51%). Approximately $171million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities were sold by PEPS I to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries the $171million in cash and issued to them an additional $279million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities. The fixed-maturity securities Aon subsidiaries received from PEPS I are rated as investment grade by Standard& Poor's Ratings Services. In second quarter 2002, Aon recognized a $32million impairment write-down on a portion of the preferred stock securities.
As part of this transaction, the insurance underwriting subsidiaries are required to purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, as they are requested. In 2002, Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries funded $38million of commitments. As of December31, 2002, these unfunded commitments amount to $100million. Based on the downgrades to Aon and the underwriting subsidiaries made by the ratings agencies in October2002, credit support arrangements were put in place on January27, 2003, whereby $100million of cash of one of Aon's underwriting subsidiaries has been pledged as collateral for these commitments. If the insurance underwriting subsidiaries fail to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities as commitments are drawn down, Aon has guaranteed their purchase. These commitments have specific expiration dates and the general partners may decide not to draw on these commitments.
To achieve the benefits of the securitization, Aon gave up all future voting interests in and control over the limited partnership interests sold to PEPS I and has no voting interest, control or significant influence over the business activities of PEPS I.
81 Aon has obtained a true sale/non-consolidation opinion from qualified external legal counsel.
PEPS I holds limited partnership investments. The legal documents that established PEPS I specify the actions that PEPS I and the servicer will undertake when PEPS I is required to make a voting decision (due to the general partner of a limited partnership calling for the vote of limited partners or proxy voting on a money market fund that PEPS I is invested in). Additionally, the legal documents contain specific instructions regarding actions to be taken if PEPS I receives (or has the ability to receive) distributions of investments held by limited partnerships in which it is invested. In instances where the general partner of a given investment may distribute underlying invested company shares to the limited partners (such as PEPS I), the legal documents that establish PEPS I outline very specific disposal instructions.
Throughout the life of PEPS I, at least 10% of the beneficial interests will be held by parties other than the transferor, its affiliates or its agents. This 10% threshold is accomplished through the first tranche notes outstanding to unaffiliated third party investors.
PEPS I will invest cash collected from the limited partnerships pending distribution to holders of beneficial interests. PEPS I invests only in relatively risk free investments with maturities no later than an expected distribution date.
All holders of each of the above beneficial interests have the right to pledge or exchange (sell), without any constraints, the beneficial interests that they hold. As such, there are no conditions that constrain the beneficial interest holders from pledging or exchanging their beneficial interest(s) and provide the transferor with more than a trivial benefit.

(2) Excludes $76million and $152million classified as short-term borrowings at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
82 Commercial paper borrowings of $254million at December31, 2001 were included in notes payable based on Aon's intent and ability to maintain or refinance these obligations on a long-term basis through 2005.
In November2002, Aon completed a private offering of $300million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% convertible senior debentures due 2012. Net proceeds from this offering were $296million. The debentures are unsecured obligations and are convertible into Aon common stock at an initial conversion price of approximately $21.475 per common share under certain circumstances including (1)during any fiscal quarter beginning after December31, 2002, if the closing price of Aon's common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter or (2)subject to certain exceptions, during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures for each day of the ten trading day period was less than 95% of the product of the closing sale price of Aon's common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the debentures. Aon will be required to pay additional contingent interest, beginning November15, 2007, if the trading price of the debentures for each of the five trading days immediately preceding the first day of the six month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the par value of the debentures. Beginning November19, 2007, Aon may redeem any of the debentures at an initial redemption price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The debentures were sold to qualified institutional buyers. We have reserved approximately 14million shares for the potential conversion of these debentures. In January2003, Aon filed a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of the debentures.
In December2002, Aon completed a private offering of $225million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior notes due 2012. Net proceeds from this offering were $223million. The debentures were sold to qualified institutional buyers.
Aon has used the net proceeds of both offerings to repay outstanding commercial paper, other short-term debt and certain other notes payable. In addition, some of the funds were used to repurchase a portion of Aon's 8.205% Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities (see note11). A portion of the funds were invested and utilized to repay $150million of LIBOR+1% debt securities that matured in January2003.
In December2001, Aon issued $150million of debt securities with a floating interest rate of LIBOR +1% due January2003 and $250million of 6.2% debt securities due January2007. This debt was initially sold to qualified institutional buyers under Rule144A of the Securities Act and the net proceeds were used to reduce short-term borrowings. In December2002, Aon consummated an offer to exchange the 6.2% notes for registered notes having identical terms. Because of the ratings downgrades during 2002, the interest rate on the 6.2% debt securities was increased to 6.7%, effective January2003.
Interest is payable semi-annually on most debt securities. In addition, the debt securities are not redeemable by Aon prior to maturity except for the 3.5% convertible debt securities, which are redeemable by Aon beginning in 2007. There are no sinking fund provisions. Maturities of notes payable are $309million, $312million, $255million, $4million and $265million in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
In September2001, Aon entered into a new committed bank credit facility under which certain European subsidiaries can borrow up to EUR 500million. At December31, 2002, Aon had borrowed EUR 74million ($76million) under this facility which is classified as short-term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial position. Aon has guaranteed the obligations of its subsidiaries with respect to this facility.
83 Aon had $875million of other unused committed bank credit facilities at December31, 2002 to support $1million of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. Aon has recently renegotiated the size of the short-term portion of the bank credit facilities, reducing the total amount to $775million in February2003. Commitment fees of 10 basis points are payable on the unused short-term portion and 12.5 basis points on the unused long-term portion. The facility requires Aon to maintain consolidated net worth of at least $2.5billion, a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and contains certain other restrictions relating to mergers and the sale or pledging of assets. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at December31, 2002.
Information related to notes payable and short-term borrowings is as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Interest paid (millions) $ 123 $ 127 $ 140 Weighted-average interest ratesshort-term borrowings 3.3 % 4.5 % 6.4 % Lease Commitments Aon has noncancelable operating leases for certain office space, equipment and automobiles.

Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December31, 2002 are: (millions) 2003 $ 311 2004 282 2005 258 2006 230 2007 197 Later years 904 Total minimum payments required $ 2,182 9.Income Tax Aon and its principal domestic subsidiaries are included in a consolidated life-nonlife federal income tax return. Aon's foreign subsidiaries file various income tax returns in their foreign jurisdictions.
84 Income (loss) before income tax and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and the provision for income tax consist of the following: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000(1) (millions) Income (loss) before income tax: U.S.

During 2002, 2001 and 2000, Aon's consolidated statements of income reflect a tax benefit of $24million, $26million and $26million, respectively, on the 8.205% Capital Securities issued in January1997 (see note11).
A reconciliation of the income tax provisions based on the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to the provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements is as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Tax-exempt investment income (0.3 ) (0.7 ) (0.5 ) Amortization of intangible assets relating to acquired businesses 0.3 4.3 2.1 State income taxes 1.6 1.4 2.5 Othernet 0.4 (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Effective tax rate 37.0 % 39.5 % 39.0 % 85 Significant components of Aon's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: As of December 31 2002 2001 (millions) Deferred tax assets: Employee benefit plans $ 400 $ 141 Unrealized foreign exchange losses 171 210 Unearned and advanced premiums and contract fees 150 110 Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 82 81 Certain purchase accounting and special charges 32 81 Unrealized investment losses  26 Other 141 146 Total 976 795 Deferred tax liabilities: Policy acquisition costs (167 ) (91 ) Unrealized investment gains (16 )  Other (71 ) (101 ) Total (254 ) (192 ) Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (33 ) (21 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 689 $ 582 There are limitations on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards after a change of control, consequently, there will be annual limitations on the realization of these tax assets. Accordingly, valuation allowances were established for various acquisitions. Subsequently, recognized tax benefits for these items would reduce goodwill. The valuation allowance changed to $33million in 2002 from $21million in 2001, corresponding to increases in related deferred tax assets, with no effect on net income. Although future earnings cannot be predicted with certainty, management currently believes that realization of the net deferred tax asset after consideration of the valuation allowance is more likely than not.
At December31, 2002, Aon had domestic operating loss carryforwards of $55million which will expire at various dates from 2003 to 2021. At December31, 2002, Aon had foreign operating loss carryforwards of $113million, which expire at various dates.
Prior to 1984, life insurance companies were required to accumulate certain untaxed amounts in a memorandum "policyholders' surplus account." Under the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the "policyholders' surplus account" balances were "capped" at December31, 1983, and the balances will be taxed only to the extent distributed to stockholders or when they exceed certain prescribed limits. As of December31, 2002, the combined "policyholders' surplus account" of Aon's life insurance subsidiaries approximates $363million. Aon's life insurance subsidiaries do not intend to make any taxable distributions or exceed the prescribed limits in the foreseeable future; therefore, no income tax provision has been made. However, if such taxes were assessed, the amount of taxes payable would be approximately $127million.
The amount of income taxes paid in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $238million, $193million and $158million, respectively.
86 10.Reinsurance and Claim Reserves Aon's insurance subsidiaries are involved in both the cession and assumption of reinsurance with other companies. Aon's reinsurance consists primarily of short-duration contracts that are entered into with the captive insurance operations of numerous automobile dealerships and insurers, certain newer accident and health initiatives as well as certain property casualty lines. Aon's insurance subsidiaries remain liable to the extent that the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations.
A summary of reinsurance activity is as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Ceded premiums earned $ 1,190 $ 921 $ 845 Ceded premiums written 1,371 1,020 888 Assumed premiums earned 493 391 379 Assumed premiums written 533 384 304 Ceded benefits to policyholders 703 630 552 Activity in the liability for policy contract claims is summarized as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Liabilities at beginning of year $ 455 $ 377 $ 448 Incurred losses: Current year 1,235 1,110 840 Prior years 25 (11 ) 16 Total 1,260 1,099 856 Payment of claims: Current year (930 ) (769 ) (633 ) Prior years (256 ) (252 ) (294 ) Total (1,186 ) (1,021 ) (927 ) Liabilities at end of year (net of reinsurance recoverables: 2002$722; 2001$482; 2000$424) $ 529 $ 455 $ 377 11.Redeemable Preferred Stock, Capital Securities and Stockholders' Equity Redeemable Preferred Stock At December31, 2002, one million shares of redeemable preferred stock were outstanding. Dividends are cumulative at an annual rate of $2.55 per share. The shares of redeemable preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of Aon or the holders, in whole or in part, at $50.00 per share beginning one year after the occurrence of a certain future event.
Capital Securities In January1997, Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities (Capital Securities). The sole asset of Aon Capital A is a $726million aggregate principal amount of Aon's 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due January1, 2027. The back-up guarantees, in the 87 aggregate, provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the trust's obligations under the Capital Securities.
Aon Capital A issued $800million of 8.205% capital securities in January1997. The proceeds from the issuance of the Capital Securities were used to finance a portion of the A&A acquisition. The Capital Securities are subject to mandatory redemption on January1, 2027 or, are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the option of Aon upon the occurrence of certain events. During 2002, approximately $98million of the Capital Securities were repurchased on the open market for $87million excluding accrued interest. An after-tax gain on the repurchases of $7million is included in minority interest in the consolidated statements of income.
Interest is payable semi-annually on the Capital Securities. The Capital Securities are categorized in the consolidated statements of financial position as "Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely Aon's Junior Subordinated Debentures." The after-tax interest incurred on the Capital Securities is reported as minority interest in the consolidated statements of income.
Common Stock In December2001, Aon filed a universal shelf registration on FormS-3 for the issuance of $750million of debt and equity securities. In November2002, Aon completed a public offering of 36.8million shares of its common stock at $17.18 per share, raising net proceeds of $607million. Aon has used the net proceeds to repay commercial paper and other short-term debt. A portion of the funds were invested and were utilized to repay debt maturing in 2003.
Aon repurchased 0.4million, 0.1million and 3.5million shares in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of its common stock. Share repurchases in 2000 were made primarily to provide shares for stock compensation plans. In addition, Aon issued 3.5million new shares of common stock in 2002 for employee benefit plans and for acquisitions. In connection with the acquisition of two entities controlled by Aon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2001 (note4), Aon obtained approximately 22.4million shares of its common stock. These treasury shares are restricted as to their reissuance. The acquisition was financed by the issuance of approximately 22.4million new shares of Aon stock.
Dividends A summary of dividends declared is as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Redeemable preferred stock $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 Common stock 230 238 223 Total dividends declared $ 233 $ 241 $ 226 Statutory Capital and Surplus Generally, the capital and surplus of Aon's insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to the parent company are limited to the amounts that the insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus exceed minimum statutory capital requirements; however, payments of the amounts as dividends in excess of $105million may be subject to approval by regulatory authorities. See note9 for possible tax effects of distributions made out of untaxed earnings.
88 Net statutory income (loss) of the insurance subsidiaries is summarized as follows: Years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Life insurance $ (13 ) $ (61 ) $ 133 Property casualty (64 ) 60 49 Statutory capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries is summarized as follows: As of December 31 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Life insurance $ 537 $ 421 $ 492 Property casualty 448 484 491 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners revised the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual in a process referred to as Codification. The revised manual was effective January1, 2001. The domiciliary states of Aon's major insurance subsidiaries have adopted the provisions of the revised manual. The revised manual changed, to some extent, prescribed statutory accounting practices and resulted in changes to the accounting practices that Aon's major insurance subsidiaries use to prepare their statutory-basis financial statements. The impact of these changes was to increase Aon's major insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus by approximately 6% as of January1, 2001.
12.Employee Benefits Savings and Profit Sharing Plans Aon subsidiaries maintain contributory savings plans for the benefit of United States salaried and commissioned employees. Provisions made for these plans were $48million, $43million and $39million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Aon sponsors defined benefit, pension and postretirement health and welfare plans that provide retirement, medical and life insurance benefits. The postretirement healthcare plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance and pension plans are noncontributory.
U.S. Pension and Other Benefit Plans The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 and a statement of the funded status as of 89 December31, 2002 and 2001, for both qualified and non-qualified plans. The measurement for the U.S. plans is November30.

In 2001, plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets were unfunded plans with a PBO of $71million, and plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets were unfunded plans with an ABO of $60million.
In both 2002 and 2001, pension plan assets include 3.7million shares of common stock issued by Aon on which dividends of $3.1million and $3.3million were received in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
90 The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the plans for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Pension Benefits 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Service cost $ 46 $ 33 $ 32 Interest cost 72 65 60 Expected return on plan assets (108 ) (104 ) (95 ) Amortization of prior-service (2 ) (1 ) (1 ) Amortization of net (gain) loss 2 (8 ) (7 ) Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $ 10 $ (15 ) $ (11 ) Other Benefits 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Service cost $ 3 $ 2 $ 2 Interest cost 5 5 5 Amortization of prior-service   (5 ) Amortization of net gain (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Net periodic benefit cost $ 7 $ 6 $ 1 The weighted-average assumptions for the measurement period for U.S. benefit obligations are shown in the following table: Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2002 2001 2002 2001 Discount rate 7.0 % 7.5 % 7.0 % 7.5 % Expected return on plan assets 8.5 10.3   Rate of compensation increase 3.5 4.0 3.5 4.0 Assumptions for Other Postretirement Benefits The employer's liability for future plan cost increase is limited in any year to 5% per annum. For measurement purposes in 2002, 2001 and 2000, the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (trend rate) adjusted for actual current year cost experience was assumed to be 11.5%, 12.0% and 7.5%, respectively, decreasing gradually to 5.5% in year 2014 and remaining the same thereafter. However, with the employer funding increase cap limited to 5% per year, net employer trend rates are effectively limited to 5% per year in the future.
As a result, a 1% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates has no effect on the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement healthcare benefit cost and on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the measurement period ended in 2002.
International Pension Plans The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 and a statement of the funded status as of 91 December31, 2002 and 2001, for material international pension plans, which are located in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The measurement date for these plans is September30.

In 2001, plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $1.9billion and plan assets with a fair value of $1.5billion, and plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had an ABO of $1.0billion and plan assets with a fair value of $0.9billion.
92 The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost for the international plans for the measurement period ended in 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 (millions) Service cost $ 45 $ 51 $ 65 Interest cost 133 124 123 Expected return on plan assets (163 ) (182 ) (193 ) Amortization of net loss 31 11 10 Net periodic benefit cost $ 46 $ 4 $ 5 The weighted-average assumptions for the measurement period for the international pension benefit obligations are shown in the following table: 2002 2001 2000 Discount rate 5.5-5.75 % 6.25-7.0 % 6.0-7.0 % Expected return on plan assets 6.0-7.5 6.0-9.5 7.0-10.0 Rate of compensation increase 3.75-4.0 4.0 4.0-4.5 13.Stock Compensation Plans In 2001, Aon stockholders approved the Aon Stock Incentive Plan, which replaced all existing incentive compensation plans, including the Aon Stock Award Plan and the Aon Stock Option Plan. Under the new plan, non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards may be granted. The annual rate of which awards are granted each year is based upon financial and competitive business conditions. The number of shares authorized to be issued under the new plan is equal to 18% of the number of common shares outstanding of Aon.
Stock Awards Generally, employees are required to complete three continuous years of service before the award begins to vest in increments until the completion of a 10-year period of continuous employment. In 2002, a significant number of awards were granted that vest annually over five years, with the initial vesting occurring after one year of continuous service. In general, most awarded shares are issued as they become vested. In certain circumstances, an employee can elect to defer the receipt of vested shares to a later date. With certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause forfeiture of all unvested awards. The compensation cost associated with each award is deferred and amortized over the period of continuous employment using the straight-line method. At December31, 2002 and 2001, the number of shares available for award is included with options available for grant.
Aon common stock awards outstanding consist of the following: Years ended December31 2002 2001 2000 (shares in thousands) Shares outstanding at beginning of year 7,424 8,881 9,865 Granted 1,024 258 586 Vested (1,432 ) (1,488 ) (1,216 ) Canceled (533 ) (227 ) (354 ) Shares outstanding at end of year 6,483 7,424 8,881 93 Stock Options Options to purchase common stock are granted to certain officers and employees of Aon and its subsidiaries at 100% of market value on the date of grant. Generally, employees are required to complete two continuous years of service before the options begin to vest in increments until the completion of a 4-year period of continuous employment. For all grants made prior to an amendment to the former stock option plan in 2000, employees were required to complete three continuous years of service before the options began to vest in increments until the completion of a 6-year period of continuous employment.

Under the original plan, shares of Aon's common stock could be purchased at 6-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or the last day of each 6-month period. Effective July1, 2000, the plan was amended by changing the purchase period to 3-month intervals. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, 312,000 shares, 680,000 shares and 940,000 shares, respectively, were issued to employees under the plan. In the first quarter 2002, the plan was suspended in anticipation of the planned divestiture of the insurance underwriting businesses (note1). The plan was reactivated as of January1, 2003. There was no compensation expense associated with this plan.
United Kingdom In 1999, Aon adopted an employee stock purchase plan that provides for the purchase of approximately 720,000 shares of Aon common stock by eligible U.K. employees after a 3-year period 95 and is similar to the U.S. plan described above. In 2002, 4,000 shares were issued to employees under the plan. No shares were issued under the plan in 2001 or 2000. There was no compensation expense associated with this plan.
14.Financial Instruments Financial Risk Management Aon is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity securities prices. To manage the risk related to these exposures, Aon enters into various derivative transactions that have the effect of reducing these risks by creating offsetting market exposures. If Aon did not use derivative contracts, its exposure to market risk would be higher.
Derivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.
Certain derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. The credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to Aon. Aon has limited its credit risk by restricting investments in derivative contracts to a diverse group of highly rated major financial institutions and by using exchange-traded instruments. Aon closely monitors the creditworthiness of and exposure to its counterparties and considers its credit risk to be minimal. At December31, 2002 and 2001, Aon placed cash and securities relating to these derivative contracts in escrow amounting to $11million and $5million, respectively.
Foreign currency forward contracts (forwards) and interest rate swaps entered into require no up-front premium. Forwards settle at the expiration of the related contract. The net effect of swap payments is settled periodically and reported in income. The premium and commission paid for purchased options, including interest rate caps and floors, and premium received, net of commission paid, for written options represent the cost basis of the position until it expires or is closed. The commission paid for futures contracts represents the cost basis of the position, until it expires or is closed. Exchange-traded futures are valued and settled daily. Unless otherwise noted, derivative instruments are generally reported in other receivables and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.
Accounting Policy for Derivative Instruments Effective October1, 2000, Aon adopted FASB Statement No.133. FASB Statement No.133 requires all derivative instruments to be recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivative is designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting.
FASB Statement No.133 identifies three hedging relationships where a derivative (hedging instrument) may qualify for hedge accounting: a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment (fair value hedge), a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized asset or liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge) and a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
In order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally documented and designated as a hedge at inception and be consistent with Aon's overall risk management policy. The hedge relationship must be highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. For a highly effective hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument must be expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Aon performs frequent analyses to measure hedge effectiveness.
96 The change in fair value of a hedging instrument designated and qualified as a fair value hedge and the change in value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are both recognized currently in earnings. The effective portion of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently reclassified to income when the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For a derivative designated and qualified as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary, the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported in OCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary is recognized immediately in earnings.
Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument designated and qualified as a hedge was not recognized immediately in earnings.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Certain of Aon's foreign brokerage subsidiaries, primarily in the United Kingdom, receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. To reduce the variability of cash flows from these transactions, Aon has entered into foreign exchange forwards and options with settlement dates prior to December2004. Upon adoption of FASB Statement No.133, designated and qualified forwards are accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. As of December31, 2002, a $32million pretax gain has been deferred to OCI, $21million of which is expected to impact pretax earnings in 2003. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded.
Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, these transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting and changes in the fair value related to these derivatives were recorded in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain other forward and option contracts did not meet the hedging requirements of FASB Statement No.133. Changes in fair value related to these contracts were recorded in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
Aon uses exchange-traded foreign currency futures and options on futures, as well as over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of Aon's foreign operations. These derivatives are not afforded hedge accounting as defined by FASB Statement No.133 and prior guidance. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
Aon uses forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated inter-company notes. During 2002, there were no designated and qualifying hedges of this exposure.
In 2000, Aon entered into a cross currency swap to hedge the foreign currency and interest rate risks associated with a foreign denominated fixed-rate policyholder liability. This swap has been designated as a fair value hedge of the combined exposure. There was no material ineffectiveness related to this hedge.
Interest Rate Risk Management Aon uses futures contracts and purchases options on futures contracts to reduce the price volatility of its fixed-maturity portfolio. Upon adoption of FASB Statement No.133, derivatives designated and qualified as hedging specific fixed-income securities are accounted for as fair value hedges. There were no designated and qualified hedges at December31, 2002. Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, realized gains and losses on derivatives that qualified as hedges were deferred and reported as 97 an adjustment of the cost basis of the hedged item and are being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item.
Aon occasionally enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of its fixed-rate notes. The interest rate swaps qualify as fair value hedges and there was no ineffectiveness recorded. Realized gains and losses on swaps qualified as hedges are deferred and reported as adjustments of the cost basis of the hedged items and are being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged items. Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, Aon purchased futures contracts to hedge the fair value of its fixed-rate notes from changes in interest rates. Aon deferred the gains from the termination of the contracts and is amortizing these gains over the remaining life of the fixed-rate notes.
Aon issued fixed-rate notes in May2000. Aon purchased options on interest rate swaps to hedge against the change in interest rates prior to the issuance. These options qualified as a hedge of an anticipated transaction under prior accounting guidance and related gains were deferred and are being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. Upon the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, pretax deferred gains of $5million were reclassified to OCI. At December31, 2002, $3million remains in OCI, $1million of which is expected to offset interest expense in 2003.
Aon enters into interest rate swap and floor agreements and uses exchange-traded futures and options to limit its net exposure to decreasing short-term interest rates, primarily relating to brokerage fiduciary funds in the U.S. and the U.K. Aon also sells exchange-traded futures to limit its exposure to increasing long-term interest rates. Since the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, there were no designated and qualified cash flow hedges of these exposures. Changes in fair value related to these contracts were recorded in investment income in the consolidated statements of income. Under prior accounting guidance, realized gains and losses were deferred and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affected earnings.
Aon uses interest rate swaps and caps to limit its exposure to changes in interest rates related to interest rate guarantees provided by a subsidiary of Aon to certain unaffiliated entities. Under prior accounting guidance, these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting treatment, and realized gains and losses were deferred and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affected earnings. In August2000, these guarantees were replaced with new offsetting interest rate swaps between Aon and an unaffiliated entity, with Aon essentially retaining the same exposure. Following the replacement of the original hedged item, hedge accounting was terminated and previously deferred realized gains and losses as well as previously unrecognized changes in fair value were recognized in earnings. The termination of this hedging relationship did not have a material effect on pretax earnings. The adoption of FASB Statement No.133 did not affect the accounting for these derivative instruments.
Equity Price Risk Management Aon sells futures contracts and purchases options to reduce the price volatility of its equity securities portfolio and equity securities it owns indirectly through limited partnership investments. Since the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, there were no designated and qualified hedges of this exposure. Prior to the adoption of FASB Statement No.133, realized gains and losses on derivatives that qualified as hedges were deferred and reported as an adjustment of the cost basis of the hedged item and are being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item. Realized gains and losses on derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment were recognized immediately in investment income in the consolidated statements of income.
98 Other Financial Instruments Prior to 2002, an Aon subsidiary issued fixed- and floating-rate Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICS) and floating-rate funding agreements and invested the proceeds primarily in the U.S. fixed income markets. The assets backing the GICS are subject to varying elements of credit and market risk. This program is currently in run-off.
Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) Excluding PEPS I.
Certain of Aon's subsidiaries make short-term loans (generally with terms of 12months or less) to businesses for the financing of insurance premiums and then securitize the finance receivables through securitization transactions that meet the criteria for sale accounting in accordance with FASB Statement No.140. These premium financing securitizations are accomplished through the use of special purpose entities which are considered QSPEs pursuant to FASB Statement No.140, and commercial paper bank conduits (multi-seller non-qualified SPEs). FASB Statement No.140 provides that a QSPE should not be consolidated in the financial statements of a transferor or its affiliates (Aon's subsidiaries).
Premium financing securitizations performed by Aon's Canadian and Australian subsidiaries utilize multi-seller non-qualified SPEs. Based on an analysis of the qualitative and quantitative factors of the SPEs, Aon has determined that it is not the sponsor of the SPEs. Additionally, independent third parties (i)have made substantial equity investments in the SPEs, (ii)have voting control of the SPEs and (iii)generally have the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets of the SPEs. Based on these factors, Aon has determined non-consolidation to be the appropriate accounting treatment in accordance with current accounting guidance.
As of December31, 2002 and 2001, the maximum commitment contained in these agreements was $1.7billion and $1.4billion, respectively, and the maximum credit risk under recourse provisions was approximately $97 and $82million, respectively, which represents the extent of the limited recourse. These recourse obligations are guaranteed by Aon. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, the unpaid principal amount of securitized receivables outstanding was $1.6billion and $1.3billion, respectively.
A subsidiary of Aon is also a general partner in a limited partnership ("LP") that purchased automobile installment contracts from automobile dealers and subsequently securitized these contracts through securitization transactions in accordance with the requirements of FASB Statement No.140. Effective April1, 2001, the LP ceased purchasing and securitizing new automobile installment contracts. A subsidiary of Aon services the existing portfolio for the LP. Aon acts as a performance guarantor with respect to its subsidiary's servicing duties under the securitization agreement. Aon uses the equity method of accounting to record its share of the net income or loss of the LP. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, the remaining unpaid principal amount of securitized installment contracts outstanding was $466million and $1billion, respectively. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, as the general partner of the LP, Aon had approximately $121million and $143million, respectively, of recourse with respect to a limited guarantee relating to the LP's securitization agreement. In February2003, an agreement was reached with the beneficial interest holders, reducing the amount of recourse to Aon to $66million.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Accounting standards require the disclosure of fair values for certain financial instruments. The fair value disclosures are not intended to encompass the majority of policy liabilities, various other non-financial instruments or other intangible assets related to Aon's business. Accordingly, care should 99 be exercised in deriving conclusions about Aon's business or financial condition based on the fair value disclosures. The carrying value and fair value of certain of Aon's financial instruments are as follows: As of December31 2002 2001 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value (millions) Assets: Fixed maturities and equity securities $ 2,151 $ 2,151 $ 2,531 $ 2,531 Other investments 600 599 640 639 Cash, receivables and short-term investments* 13,906 13,906 11,264 11,264 Derivatives 79 79 46 46 Liabilities: Investment-type insurance contracts 139 136 813 782 Short-term borrowings, premium payables and general expenses 12,033 12,033 10,260 10,260 Notes payable 1,671 1,754 1,694 1,750 Capital securities 702 632 800 782 Derivatives 45 45 55 55 * Excludes derivatives.
Guarantees and Indemnifications Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others to allow Aon or others to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The maximum potential amount of future payments represent the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated amounts payable which are deemed to be probable and estimable are properly reflected in Aon's consolidated financial statements.
Refer to Other Financial Instruments, above, for guarantees associated with Aon's premium and auto loan financing securitizations. Guarantees associated with Aon's limited partnership securitization are disclosed in note7. Indemnities related to discontinued operations are disclosed in note6. Contingent shares issuable related to prior acquisitions are disclosed in note4.
Aon and its subsidiaries have issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $60million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. Amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for these letters of credit to the extent they are probable and estimable.
Aon has certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. Costs associated with these guarantees, to the extent estimable and probable, are provided in Aon's allowance for doubtful accounts. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $30million at December31, 2002.
Aon expects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time.
100 15.Contingencies Aon and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments and lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages that may be claimed are substantial, including in many instances, claims for punitive or extraordinary damages. Accruals for these items have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are estimable.
In the second quarter of 1999, Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America,Inc. ("Allianz") filed an amended complaint in Minnesota adding a brokerage subsidiary of Aon as a defendant in an action which Allianz brought against three insurance carriers reinsured by Allianz. These three carriers provided certain types of workers' compensation reinsurance to a pool of insurers and to certain facilities managed by Unicover Managers,Inc. ("Unicover"), a New Jersey corporation not affiliated with Aon. Allianz alleges that the Aon subsidiary acted as an agent of the three carriers when placing reinsurance coverage on their behalf. Allianz claims that the reinsurance it issued should be rescinded or that it should be awarded damages, based on alleged fraudulent, negligent and innocent misrepresentations by the carriers, through their agents, including the Aon subsidiary defendant.
On August30, 2002, two of the three carriers referred to above filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Aon brokerage subsidiary. The two carriers are currently involved in an arbitration proceeding with Allianz, related to the original litigation, in which Allianz seeks the recission of the reinsurance placements. These carriers also seek to recover from the Aon brokerage subsidiary any damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees, suffered by such carriers as a result of an adverse arbitration award. Aon believes that the Aon subsidiary has meritorious defenses and the Aon subsidiary intends to vigorously defend this claim. On January8, 2003, the two carriers dismissed their lawsuit without prejudice, meaning it could be refiled at a later time. The remaining Unicover issues are complex, and therefore, the timing and amount of resolution cannot be determined at this time. In early October2002, there was reportedly an award made by arbitrators in an arbitration held in New York among Unicover Managers,Inc., Unicover pool members and the three carriers referred to above. Aon has not received a copy of the arbitration award and therefore cannot make an informed statement as to its content.
Certain United Kingdom subsidiaries of Aon have been required by their regulatory body, the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), to review advice given by those subsidiaries to individuals who bought pension plans during the period from April1988 to June1994. These reviews have resulted in a requirement to pay compensation to clients based on guidelines issued by the PIA. Aon's ultimate exposure from the private pension plan review, as presently calculated, is subject to a number of variable factors including, among others, general level of pricing in the equity markets, the interest rate established quarterly for calculating compensation, and the precise scope, duration and methodology of the review, including whether recent regulatory guidance will have to be applied to previously settled claims. These variable factors are ones that the U.K. Financial Services Authority, the current governing body in the U.K., has used as a basis in the past for establishing the calculation tables to determine redress or compensatory amounts. Because Aon is unable to predict if, or how, regulators may change these tables or if, or how, they may apply future regulatory guidance to previous claims, Aon has been, and will continue to be, unable to determine a range or estimate of additional possible exposure.
One of Aon's insurance subsidiaries is a defendant in more than twenty lawsuits in Mississippi. The lawsuits generally allege misconduct by the subsidiary in the solicitation and sale of insurance policies. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs in these lawsuits have advised the subsidiary that approximately 2,700 other current or former policyholders may file similar claims. Each lawsuit includes, and each threatened claim could include, a request for punitive damages. Aon's insurance subsidiary has been litigating the pending suits and investigating the claims. In the second quarter 2002, Aon negotiated a compromise of several of the lawsuits and approximately 2,000 of the claims. In the third quarter of 101 2002, the settlement of approximately 1,000 of these claims has been concluded. The remainder of the settlements is of uncertain status. Aon's insurance subsidiary has filed a lawsuit against the claimaints' attorney asserting that the settlements were not appropriately completed. If these settlements are concluded, there will still be at least 2,700 threatened claims outstanding. Each of the remaining lawsuits and any threatened claim is being investigated and vigorously defended.
On August8, 2002, Daniel& Raizel Taubenfeld, a purported Aon stockholder, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, on behalf of purchasers of Aon Common Stock between May4, 1999 and August6, 2002. The complaint names Aon, Patrick G. Ryan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Harvey N. Medvin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as defendants, and contains allegations of violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule10b-5 promulgated under such Act relating to Aon's press release issued on August7, 2002. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, class action certification, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount and an award of costs and expenses, including counsel fees. On January17, 2003, the lead plaintiff filed a "Consolidated Amended Complaint" against the same defendants which alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule10b-5 promulgated under such Act. Aon intends to defend this action vigorously.
There have been nine other putative class action lawsuits filed against Aon and certain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and that each is substantially similar to the lawsuit described in the immediately preceding paragraph. All of these actions have been consolidated with the Taubenfeld action and a lead plaintiff has been appointed by the court. Aon intends to defend each of these actions vigorously.
Aon has also received a complaint which purports to be a shareholder's derivative action against Aon and each of Aon's directors. This complaint, which is styled Bernard Stern v. Patrick Ryan, et al.
was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on September13, 2002. This lawsuit makes allegations which are substantially similar to the original Taubenfeld lawsuit. Aon intends to defend this action vigorously.
Although the ultimate outcome of matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by unfavorable resolution of these matters.
16.Segment Information Aon classifies its businesses into three operating segments: Insurance Brokerage and Other Services, Consulting and Insurance Underwriting. A fourth non-operating segment, Corporate and Other, when aggregated with the operating segments, totals to the amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the resources producing the revenues. Intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computing consolidated revenues and income before tax. There are no material inter-segment amounts to be eliminated. Long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization are not material.
102 Consolidated revenue by geographic area follows: Total United States United Kingdom Continent of Europe Rest of World (millions) Revenue for the years ended December 31: 2002 $ 8,822 $ 5,034 $ 1,621 $ 1,117 $ 1,050 2001 7,676 4,463 1,390 938 885 2000 7,375 4,350 1,363 833 829 The Insurance Brokerage and Other Services segment consists principally of Aon's retail, reinsurance and wholesale brokerage, as well as related insurance services, including claims services, underwriting management, captive insurance company management services and premium financing. Aon's retail brokerage area provides a broad spectrum of advisory and outsourcing services including risk identification and assessment, alternative risk financing, safety engineering, loss management and program administration for clients. This area also designs, places and implements customized insurance solutions. Aon's reinsurance brokerage activities offer sophisticated advisory services in program design that enhance the risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios and improve capital utilization, along with the evaluation of catastrophic loss exposures. Aon also actively participates in placement and captive management services, designing programs that enable clients to effectively retain a portion of certain risks that are cost prohibitive or unavailable in the traditional insurance markets. Aon offers claims administration and loss cost management services to insurance companies, firms with self-insurance programs and to agents and brokers for the benefits of their customers.
The wholesale operations, serving thousands of independent insurance brokers and agents nationwide, provide brokering expertise and underwriting solutions, with custom-designed products and services in several specialty areas, including entertainment, public entities, directors' and officers' and professional liability, workers' compensation, media, financial institutions, marine, aviation, construction, healthcare and energy.
Our Consulting segment is one of the world's largest integrated human capital consulting organizations. The operations of this segment provide a full range of human capital management services. These services are delivered predominantly to corporate clientele utilizing five major practices: employee benefits, compensation, management consulting, outsourcing and communications.

(3) During 2001, Aon reclassified $520million of notes receivablesubsidiaries to investments in subsidiaries related to its shared services operations.
(4) Investments in subsidiaries include approximately $2.6billion invested in countries outside of the United States, primarily denominated in the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar.
(5) Guarantees and Indemnifications Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others to allow Aon or others to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The maximum potential amount of future payments represent the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Aon does not currently anticipate making future payments to any of its subsidiaries, or third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries, for these guarantees and indemnifications.
One of Aon's insurance underwriting subsidiaries holds a $95million demand note receivable from another Aon subsidiary as of December31, 2002. Aon has guaranteed the repayment of this note in the event that the obligated subsidiary is unable to make the principal payment, in whole or in part, when contractually due.
Aon has unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of certain of its operating subsidiaries with respect to specific noncancelable operating leases. At December31, 2002, future minimum payments (excluding sublease income) under these leases were approximately $95million. These amounts are included in lease commitments, which are reflected in note8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Aon has provided indemnification under surety bonds issued by third parties of approximately $170million as of December31, 2002. These license, performance and other types of surety bonds are issued to permit operating subsidiaries of Aon to conduct business in various jurisdictions and to indemnify third parties for nonperformance by these subsidiaries.
A bank provides overdraft facilities for certain of Aon's foreign subsidiaries. Aon has guaranteed repayment of this facility in the unlikely event that the foreign subsidiaries are unable to repay. Aon has also issued guarantees and/or other letters of support for various bank lines, and various other credit facilities for certain of its foreign operations (including the Euro credit facility discussed in note8 to the consolidated financial statements). Aon's maximum potential liability with regard to these exposures was $160million at December31, 2002.
Aon has guaranteed the contractual performance of certain subsidiaries for third-party outsourcing agreements, which extend through 2009. However, in no case can the cumulative amount of these guarantees exceed $50million.
Aon has guaranteed the contractual performance of certain subsidiaries for other agreements, which extend no later than June30, 2003. Aon does not expect to incur any additional expenses or liabilities as a result of these guarantees. The notional amounts involved are $130million.
Aon has guaranteed the obligations of one of its major Netherlands' subsidiaries through 2007. Management believes there is sufficient operating cash flow, liquidity and equity at this subsidiary to cover current obligations and future obligations as they come due.
Aon expects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
Our shareholders approved the Aon Stock Incentive Plan in 2001. This plan is designed to further align our directors', management's and key employees' interests with the company's long-term performance and the long-term interests of our shareholders.
The following table summarizes the number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under our equity compensation plans as of December31, 2002.

(3) Aon UK Sharesave Scheme The Aon UK Sharesave Scheme (the "UK Scheme") is available solely to employees in the United Kingdom. Under the UK Scheme, employees authorize Aon to deduct a specified amount from compensation each pay period for deposit into a savings account for a three-year term. If a 115 participant's deductions continue through the last day of the term, the participant is credited with a tax-free cash bonus equal to 2.75 times the monthly payroll deduction. Participants may cease participation in the UK Scheme at any time. Participants are also granted options at the beginning of each savings period and may direct Aon to purchase or issue shares of Aon common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value at the beginning of the period, utilizing the accumulated amounts in their account. Options may be exercised generally within six months after the last day of the term, or after death, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement. If a participant ceases to be employed by Aon for other reason, or declines to purchase Aon common stock during any of the available purchase periods, the participant's right to purchase shares of Aon common stock or accumulate additional payroll deductions lapses. The UK Scheme was approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the UK Scheme has been made.
(4) As of December31, 2002, 36 individuals held options granted under the UK Scheme for a total of 6,360 shares of Aon common stock at an option price of 23.10.
(5) Aon Supplemental Savings Plan The Aon Supplemental Savings Plan (the "ASSP") was adopted by the board of directors in 1998. It is a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provides benefits to participants in the Aon Savings Plan whose employer matching contributions are limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. Under the ASSP, participants are credited with the additional matching contributions they would have received under the Aon Savings Plan100% of the first 1% to 3% of compensation (the First Tier Match) and 75% of the next 4% to 6% of compensation (the Second Tier Match)had compensation up to $500,000 been considered. Participants in the ASSP may elect to have Tier I allocations credited to their accounts as if invested in a money market account or as if invested in Aon common stock. Tier II allocations are maintained in an Aon common stock account unless the participant is age 55 or more. If so, the participant may elect to direct his or her allocation to the money market account. Amounts maintained in the Aon common stock account may not be moved to the money market account, regardless of the participant's age. Before the beginning of each plan year, an election may be made by any participant to transfer some or all of a participant's money market account to the Aon common stock account. All amounts credited to the Aon common stock account are credited with dividends.
Payments from the Aon common stock account are made only in shares of Aon common stock. Payments from the money market account are made in cash. Payments may be made in single sum or ten annual installments.
No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the plan has been made.
(6) Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan The Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan was a plan established in 1989 as a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provided benefits to participants in the Aon Employee Stock Ownership Plan whose employer contributions were limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. As of 1998, no additional amounts have been credited to participant accounts, although account balances are maintained for participants, and credited with dividends, until distribution is required under the plan. Distributions are made solely in Aon common stock.
No specific authorization of shares of Aon common stock for the plan has been made.

Item 14. Controls and Procedures.
The Registrant has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Registrant's financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.
Based on their evaluation as of a date within 90days of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form10-K, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Registrant have concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
