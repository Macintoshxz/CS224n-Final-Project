GENERAL Comerica Incorporated (Comerica) is a financial services company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Based on total assets as reported in the most recently filed Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C), it was among the 25 largest commercial United States (U.S.) financial holding companies. Comerica was formed in 1973 to acquire the outstanding common stock of Comerica Bank, which at such time was a Michigan banking corporation and one of Michigan's oldest banks (formerly Comerica Bank-Detroit). On October31, 2007, Comerica Bank, a Michigan banking corporation, was merged with and into Comerica Bank, a Texas banking association (Comerica Bank). As of December31, 2015 , Comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2 active banking and 36 non-banking subsidiaries. At December31, 2015 , Comerica had total assets of approximately $71.9 billion , total deposits of approximately $59.9 billion , total loans (net of unearned income) of approximately $49.1 billion and shareholders equity of approximately $7.6 billion .

Acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc.
On July 28, 2011, Comerica acquired all the outstanding common stock of Sterling Bancshares, Inc. ("Sterling"), a bank holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Sterling common shareholders and holders of outstanding Sterling phantom stock units received 0.2365 shares of Comerica's common stock in exchange for each share of Sterling common stock or phantom stock unit. As a result, Comerica issued approximately 24 million common shares with an acquisition date fair value of $793 million, based on Comerica's closing stock price of $32.67 on July 27, 2011. Based on the merger agreement, outstanding and unexercised options to purchase Sterling common stock were converted into fully vested options to purchase common stock of Comerica. In addition, outstanding warrants to purchase Sterling common stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock of Comerica. Including an insignificant amount of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, the fair value of total consideration paid was $803 million. The acquisition of Sterling significantly expanded Comerica's presence in Texas, particularly in the Houston and San Antonio areas.
COMPETITION The financial services business is highly competitive. Comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of Texas, California and Michigan, as well as in the states of Arizona and Florida. They also compete in broader, national geographic markets, as well as markets in Mexico and Canada. They are subject to competition with respect to various products and services, including, without limitation, loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services, loan syndication services, consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering, mortgage loan origination, consumer products, fiduciary services, private banking, retirement services, investment management and advisory services, investment banking services, brokerage services, the sale of annuity products, and the sale of life, disability and long-term care insurance products.
Comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions. Some of Comerica's larger competitors, including certain nationwide banks that have a significant 1 Table of Contents presence in Comerica's market area, may make available to their customers a broader array of product, pricing and structure alternatives and, due to their asset size, may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio. Some of Comerica's competitors (larger or smaller) may have more liberal lending policies and processes. Further, Comerica's banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered. They may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure. Comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future.
In addition to banks, Comerica's banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries, including savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, leasing companies, venture capital funds, credit unions, investment banks, insurance companies and securities firms. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures.
In addition, the industry continues to consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Banks, bank holding companies, and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. Comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage. The conditions to be a financial holding company include, among others, the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed. Effective July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level. Comerica became a financial holding company in 2000. As a financial holding company, Comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies, and engage in activities that are financial in nature. Activities that are financial in nature include, but are not limited to: securities underwriting; securities dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies (subject to regulatory requirements, including restrictions set forth in the Volcker Rule, described under the heading "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Other Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments " below); insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity, provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally. A bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking.
Comerica Bank is chartered by the State of Texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking under the Texas Finance Code. Comerica Bank has elected to be a member of the Federal Reserve System under the Federal Reserve Act and, consequently, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) under the National Bank Act. Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association, by virtue of being a national bank, is also a member of the Federal Reserve System. The deposits of Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to the extent provided by law. Certain transactions executed by Comerica Bank are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  In Canada, Comerica Bank is supervised by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and in Mexico, by the Banco de Mxico.
The FRB supervises non-banking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by Comerica. In addition, Comerica's non-banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state, federal and self-regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (in the case of Comerica Securities,Inc.), the Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation of the State of Michigan (in the case of Comerica Securities,Inc. and Comerica Insurance Services,Inc.), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (in the case of Comerica Securities,Inc. and World Asset Management,Inc.).
Described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Comerica and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the business of Comerica and its subsidiaries.
2 Table of Contents Requirements for Approval of Acquisitions and Activities In most cases, no FRB approval is required for Comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. However, Federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies. Prior approval is required before Comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company (including a financial holding company) or a bank.
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires U.S. banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities. Comerica Bank's current rating under the CRA is satisfactory. If any subsidiary bank of Comerica were to receive a rating under the CRA of less than satisfactory, Comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities.
In addition, Comerica, Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association, are each well capitalized and well managed under FRB standards. If any subsidiary bank of Comerica were to cease being well capitalized or well managed under applicable regulatory standards, the FRB could place limitations on Comerica's ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of Comerica or its affiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the FRB could order Comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies, or Comerica could elect to conform its non-banking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company.
Further, the effectiveness of Comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with anti-money laundering regulations (discussed below) is also taken into account by the FRB when considering applications for approval of acquisitions.
Transactions with Affiliates Various governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB's Regulation W, limit borrowings by Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions, and also limit various other transactions between Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Comerica's affiliate insured depository institutions, on the other. For example, Section23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution's loans and other covered transactions with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10% of the institution's total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution's covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20% of its total capital. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Section23A of the Federal Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution's loans to its nonbank affiliates be, at a minimum, 100% secured, and Section23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository institution's transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. For example, commencing in July 2012, the Dodd-Frank Act applies the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amends the definition of covered transaction to include (i) securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate, and (ii) all derivatives transactions with an affiliate, to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowing/lending or derivative counterparty.
Privacy The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including Comerica, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes.
Anti-Money Laundering Regulations The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. To comply with these obligations, Comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices, procedures, and controls.
3 Table of Contents Interstate Banking and Branching The Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (the Interstate Act), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, permits a bank holding company, with FRB approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company's home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company, prior to and following the proposed acquisition, control no more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30% of such deposits in that state (or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30%). The Interstate Act, as amended, also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states, subject to various conditions. In the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations, the host state must have opted-in to the Interstate Act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the Interstate Act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly opt-in to de novo branching, in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. Effective July21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act also required that a bank holding company or bank be well capitalized and well managed (rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed) in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions.
Comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank, Comerica Bank, with branches in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan.
Dividends Comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. Most of Comerica's revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to Comerica, as well as by Comerica to its shareholders. Certain, but not all, of these requirements are discussed below.
Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the FRB and/or the OCC, as the case may be, for the declaration and payment of dividends, if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i)such bank's retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii)the retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. At January 1, 2016 , Comerica's subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately $398 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years. Comerica's subsidiary banks declared dividends of $437 million in 2015 , $380 million in 2014 and $480 million in 2013 .
Further, federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), prompt corrective action regime discussed below, which applies to each of Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association, a subject bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming undercapitalized. In addition, Comerica Bank is also subject to limitations under Texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to its parent company, and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels.
Additionally, the payment of dividends by Comerica to its shareholders is subject to the non-objection of the FRB pursuant to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program. For more information, please see The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Other Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments in this section.
Source of Strength and Cross-Guarantee Requirements Federal law and FRB regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC (either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure), the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the FDIC's loss, subject to certain exceptions.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act FDICIA requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository 4 Table of Contents institution's capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures, which, among others, include a Tier1 and total risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure.
Regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that, for a depository institution to be well capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and a Tier1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital measure of at least 6.5%, a Tier1 leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive. For an institution to be adequately capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital measure of at least 4.5% and a Tier1 leverage ratio of at least 4%. Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category.
As of December31, 2015 , Comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations.
FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the institution's parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of (i)an amount equal to 5% of the depository institution's total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, or (ii)the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.
Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions. Specifically, such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following, among other things: sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits, reduce its rate of asset growth, dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors, or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the FDIC and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate.
As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, FDICIA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises. The standards relate generally to, among others, earnings, liquidity, operations and management, asset quality, various risk and management exposures (e.g., credit, operational, market, interest rate, etc.) and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements, regulatory standards for real estate lending, truth in savings provisions, the requirement that a depository institution give 90days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch, and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the FDIC.
Capital Requirements Comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB and/or the OCC.
For this purpose, a depository institution's or holding company's assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the FRB, each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments, based on counterparty type and asset class. A depository institution's or holding company's capital, in turn, is divided into three tiers: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), additional Tier 1, and Tier 2.  CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards, if any. Additionally, Comerica has made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt securities, cash flow hedges, and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital primarily includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Certain deductions and adjustments to CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital are subject to phase-in through December 31, 2017. Entities that engage in trading activities, whose trading activities exceed specified levels, also are required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad market movements (such as changes in the general level of interest rates, equity prices, foreign 5 Table of Contents exchange rates, or commodity prices) or from position specific factors. From time to time, Comerica's trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels, in which case Comerica maintains additional capital for market risk as required.
Comerica, like other bank holding companies, currently is required to maintain CET1, Tier1 (the sum of CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital) and total capital (the sum of Tier1 and Tier2 capital) equal to at least 4.5%, 6% and 8% of its total risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby letters of credit), respectively. At December31, 2015 , Comerica met all requirements, with CET1, Tier1 and total capital equal to 10.54% , 10.54% and 12.69% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively.
Comerica is also required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio (Tier1 capital to non-risk-adjusted total assets) of 4%. Comerica's leverage ratio of 10.22% at December31, 2015 reflects the nature of Comerica's balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy. At December31, 2015 , Comerica Bank had CET1, Tier 1 and total capital equal to 10.20% , 10.20% and 12.05% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively, and a leverage ratio of 9.89% .
Additional information on the calculation of Comerica and its bank subsidiaries' CET1, Tier 1 capital, total capital and risk-weighted assets is set forth in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on pagesF-99 through F-100 of the Financial Section of this report. Additional information on the timing and nature of the Basel III capital requirements is set forth below, under "Basel III: Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Regime." FDIC Insurance Assessments The FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits. Comerica's subsidiary banks are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the DIF's minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. The final rule implementing revisions to the assessment system became effective April 1, 2011. Under the risk-based deposit premium assessment system, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if, for example, criticized loans and/or other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases. For 2015 , Comericas FDIC insurance expense totaled $37 million.
In November 2015, the FDIC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Assessments in order to implement section 334 of the Dodd-Frank Act (334), which requires the FDIC to (1) raise the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35 percent, from 1.15 percent, (2) assess premiums on banks to reach the 1.35 percent goal by September 30, 2020, and (3) offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The FDIC proposed a surcharge on large banks, to be assessed over a period of eight quarters, to begin the quarter after the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent, as a means to implement 334. As proposed, Comerica would be subject to the surcharge assessment. Management currently estimates that, based on the proposal, total FDIC expense would increase by approximately $10 million annually during the surcharge period, which could begin in either the first or second quarter 2016.
Enforcement Powers of Federal and State Banking Agencies The FRB and other federal and state banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including, without limitation, and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law, the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject Comerica or its banking subsidiaries, as well as officers and directors of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Other Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments The recent financial crisis has led to significant changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape of the financial services industry, including the overhaul of that landscape with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July21, 2010. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Dodd-Frank Act relevant to Comerica, as well as other recent legislative and regulatory developments. The estimates of the impact on Comerica discussed below are based on information currently available and, if applicable, are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete.
Incentive-Based Compensation .  In June 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers senior executives as well as other employees who, either individually or as part of a group, have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements (i) should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) should be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; 6 Table of Contents and (iii) should be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. Banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles. Where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements, they should be promptly addressed. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness, particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. Comerica is subject to this final guidance and, similar to other large banking organizations, has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the FRB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Texas Department of Banking since 2011. As part of that review, Comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization, the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plans design and implementation. Comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Comerica. Further, it is the Companys intent to continue to evolve our processes going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation.
On April 14, 2011, the FRB, OCC and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement Section956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements, or any feature of any such arrangement, at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss. This proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in June 2010. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $1 billion, and would impose heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes Comerica. For these larger institutions, the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of annual incentive-based payments be deferred over a period of at least three years for designated executives. Moreover, boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institution's size, capital or overall risk tolerance, and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards. Comerica is monitoring the development of this rule.
Basel III: Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Regime .  In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III). In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital requirement; sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), a standardized approach and an advanced approach; introduces two new capital buffers, a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer (applicable to advanced approach entities); establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio (applicable to advanced approach entities); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards.  As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, the rules were effective for Comerica on January 1, 2015.  Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital (primarily related to intangible assets and surplus Tier 2 capital minority interest) phase in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in at 0.625 percent beginning on January 1, 2016 and ultimately increases to 2.5 percent on January 1, 2019. Comerica is not subject to the countercyclical buffer or the supplemental leverage ratio.
Comerica's December31, 2015 CET1 and Tier 1 ratios were both 10.54 percent . Comerica's December31, 2015 CET1 and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule (4.5 percent and 6 percent, respectively).
On September 3, 2014, U.S. banking regulators adopted the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") rule, which set for U.S. banks the minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the final rule, Comerica is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality, liquid assets ("HQLA") to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule is effective for Comerica on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, Comerica will be required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent.  As of December 31, 2015, Comerica's LCR ratio meets the fully phased-in 2017 requirement.
The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"), which requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued its final NSFR rule, which was originally introduced in 2010 and revised in January 2014.  U.S. banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rules to implement the NFSR in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rule implementing the NSFR and whether or not Comerica will be subject to the full requirements, Comerica is closely monitoring the development of the rule.
Interchange Fees .  On July 20, 2011, the FRB published final rules (Regulation II) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and prohibiting network exclusivity 7 Table of Contents arrangements and routing restrictions. Comerica is subject to the final rules. In July 2013, a federal district court invalidated the FRB's interchange fee rules. The FRB's appeal of the courts ruling resulted in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overruling the district court, reinstating the final rule as previously issued. On January 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a further appeal. Accordingly, Regulation II remains intact and its limits on interchange fees are now permanent.
Supervision and Regulation Assessment .  Section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the federal banking agencies to assess fees against bank holding companies with total consolidated assets in excess of $50 billion equal to the expenses necessary or appropriate in order to carry out their supervision and regulation of those companies. Comerica accrued $1.6 million for 2015, which will be assessed in the first quarter 2016.
The Volcker Rule . The federal banking agencies and the SEC published approved joint final regulations to implement the Volcker Rule on December 10, 2013. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning and sponsoring "covered funds" (e.g. hedge funds and private equity funds). The final regulations adopt a multi-faceted approach to implementing the Volcker Rule prohibitions that relies on: (i) detailed descriptions of prohibited and permitted activities; (ii) detailed compliance requirements; and (iii) for banking entities with large volumes of trading activity, detailed quantitative analysis and reporting obligations. In addition to rules implementing the core prohibitions and exemptions (e.g. underwriting, market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and trading in certain government obligations) of the Volcker Rule, the regulations also include two appendices devoted to record-keeping and reporting requirements, including numerous quantitative data reporting obligations for banking entities with significant trading activities (Appendix A) and enhanced compliance requirements for banking entities with significant trading or covered fund activities (Appendix B). The final rule was effective April 1, 2014. The Volcker Rule generally required full compliance with the new restrictions by July 21, 2015; however, the FRB has extended the conformance period to July 21, 2017 for covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. Comerica is currently in compliance with the effective aspect of the Volcker Rule and expects to meet the final requirements adopted by regulators within the applicable regulatory timelines. Additional information on Comerica's portfolio of indirect (through funds) private equity and venture capital investments is set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on pageF-54 of the Financial Section of this report.
Annual Capital Plans and Stress Tests . Comerica is subject to the FRBs annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, as well as the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) requirements. As part of the CCAR process, the FRB undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies (BHCs), including Comerica, that have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. This capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating BHC to the FRB that describes the companys planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the FRB under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including a supervisory baseline and an adverse and a severely adverse scenario provided by the FRB. After completing its review, the FRB may object or not object to the companys proposed capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase common equity repurchase programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments. In connection with the 2015 CCAR, Comerica submitted its 2015 capital plan to the FRB on January 5, 2015; on March 5, 2015, Comerica and the FRB released the revenue, loss and capital results from the annual stress testing exercises and on March 11, 2015, Comerica announced that the FRB had completed its CCAR 2015 capital plan review and did not object to the capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in the plan.  The 2015 capital plan submission extended over a period of five quarters, second quarter 2015 - second quarter 2016, due to a modification in timing by the FRB.  Comerica plans to submit its CCAR 2016 capital plan to the FRB, consistent with new supervisory guidance (SR 15-19), in April 2016 and expects to receive the results of the FRB's review of the plan in June 2016 and to release its company-run stress tests results in June or July 2016.
FRB regulations also required that Comerica and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate mid-year stress test using financial data as of March 31st and three company-derived macro-economic scenarios (base, adverse and severely adverse) and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario.  On July 23, 2015, Comerica released the results of its company-run mid-year stress tests.  For 2016, the mid-year stress test will be moved to an October submission (instead of July).  Stress test results are available in the Investor Relations section of Comerica's website at investor.comerica.com, on the Regulatory Disclosures page under "Financial Reports." Enhanced Prudential Requirements .  The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to coordinate efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and to make recommendations to the FRB as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large, interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Act, including capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management requirements.
On February 18, 2014, the FRB issued its final regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final regulations address enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity requirements, enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, semiannual stress tests (as described above under "Annual Capital Plans and Stress Tests"), and a debt-to-equity limit 8 Table of Contents for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability. They are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the US financial system, and generally build on existing US and international regulatory guidance. The rule also takes a multi-stage or phased approach to many of the requirements (such as the capital and liquidity requirements). Most of these requirements apply to Comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than $50 billion. Comerica has or will implement all requirements of the new rules within regulatory timelines.
Resolution (Living Will) Plans .  Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (covered companies) to prepare and submit to the federal banking agencies (e.g., FRB and FDIC) a plan for their rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Covered companies, such as Comerica, with less than $100 billion in total nonbank assets were required to submit their initial plans by December 31, 2013. In addition, Section 165(d) requires FDIC-insured depository institutions (like Comerica Bank) with assets of $50 billion or more to develop, maintain, and periodically submit plans outlining how the FDIC would resolve it through the FDIC's resolution powers under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The federal banking agencies have issued rules to implement these requirements. In addition, those rules require the filing of annual updates to the plans. Both Comerica and Comerica Bank filed their respective initial and updated resolution plans by the required due dates. The 2015 resolution plan updates are currently under review by the FRB and FDIC.
Section 611 and Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act .  Section 611 of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a state bank from engaging in derivative transactions unless the lending limit laws of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration exposure to derivatives. Section 611 does not provide how state lending limit laws must factor in derivatives. The Texas Finance Commission has adopted an administrative rule meeting the requirements of Section 611. Accordingly, Comerica Bank may engage in derivative transactions, as permitted by applicable law.
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a comprehensive framework for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions. The structure for derivatives set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act is intended to promote, among other things, exchange trading and centralized clearing of swaps and security-based swaps, as well as greater transparency in the derivatives markets and enhanced monitoring of the entities that use these markets. In this regard, the CFTC and SEC have issued several regulatory proposals, some of which are now effective or will become effective in 2016.
The SEC and CFTC have jointly adopted rules further defining the terms swap, security-based swap, security-based swap agreement, and have also adopted final joint rules defining the terms swap dealer, security-based swap dealer, major swap participant, and major security-based swap participant.  Comerica has determined that neither it, nor its subsidiaries, are within the definition of swap dealer or major swap participant, but some portions of the Title VII regulations apply nonetheless. One of these regulations centers on limiting certain OTC transactions to eligible contract participants.  This regulation impacts Comerica's small business customers that do not qualify as eligible contract participants by making such customers ineligible for swap derivatives as hedging in their loan agreements.
Consumer Finance Regulations .   The Dodd-Frank Act made several changes to consumer finance laws and regulations. It contained provisions that have weakened the federal preemption rules applicable for national banks and give state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has a broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices, and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10billion in assets. In this regard, the CFPB has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that were specifically identified as being enforced by the CFPB, as well as those specified for supervisory and enforcement authority for very large depository institutions and non-depository (nonbank) entities. Comerica is subject to CFPB foreign remittance rules and home mortgage lending rules, in addition to certain other CFPB rules.
The foreign remittance rules fall under Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB issued new regulations amending Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, effective October 28, 2013. The regulations were designed to provide protections to consumers who transfer funds to recipients located in countries outside the United States (customer foreign remittance transfers). In general, the regulation requires remittance transfer providers, such as Comerica, to disclose to a consumer the exchange rate, fees, and amount to be received by the recipient when the consumer sends a remittance transfer. Although Comerica had implemented the model disclosures provided in Appendix A to the final rule, on September 18, 2014, the CFPB extended the compliance exception period for the rule's new disclosure requirements to July 21, 2020.
On November 13, 2014, the CFPB issued a proposed regulation establishing new consumer protections and disclosure requirements on prepaid accounts, including (i) the provision of either periodic statements or free online account information access; (ii) new account error and unauthorized transaction rights; (iii) new Know Before You Owe prepaid account disclosures; (iv) public disclosure of account agreements for prepaid accounts and (v) credit protection for linked credit accounts.
Comerica has implemented these new rules and positioned itself to be in compliance with the new requirements.
9 Table of Contents Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) .  In November 2013, the CFPB issued a rule implementing new TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosures (TRID) to replace the initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure and Good Faith Estimate for most closed-end consumer mortgage loans.  The effective date was October 3, 2015.  Significant changes in TRID include: (1) expansion of the scope of loans that require RESPA early disclosures, including bridge loans, vacant land loans, and construction loans; (2) changes and additions to waiting period requirements to close a loan; (3) reduced tolerances for estimated fees and (4) the lender, rather than the closing agent, is responsible for providing final disclosures. Although Comerica outsources most of its consumer mortgage loans, consumer construction financing has been suspended pending further clarification from the CFPB.  This regulation has also resulted in a suspension of consumer bridge loan financing.  Such financing has not been a significant business for Comerica.
The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires credit card issuers to post consumer credit card agreements to their websites and submit them quarterly to the CFPB commencing February 5, 2015.  The CFPB implemented the rule on April 17, 2015.  The CFPB delayed implementation of submissions of the agreements to the CFPB until the first week of April 2016. Comerica outsources its consumer credit cards, and does not anticipate any negative impact.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) .  In July 2015 the CFPB implemented and expanded new HMDA rules.  The final rule adopts a dwelling-secured standard for all loans or lines of credit that are for personal, family, or household purposes. Thus, most consumer-purpose transactions, including closed-end home-equity loans, home-equity lines of credit, and reverse mortgages, are subject to the regulation. Most commercial-purpose transactions (i.e., loans or lines of credit not for personal, family, or household purposes) are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The final rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling (i.e., home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral) and all agricultural-purpose loans and lines of credit.  Comerica is monitoring and implementing changes as required.
FDIC Guidance on Brokered Deposits . On January 5, 2015, the FDIC issued guidance in the form of Frequently Asked Questions to promote consistency by insured depository institutions in identifying, accepting, and reporting brokered deposits.  On November 13, 2015, the FDIC issued proposed updates to the FAQs. All insured depository institutions (including those that are well capitalized) must report brokered deposits in their Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports). Comerica is currently evaluating the impact of these FAQs, including the proposed updates, to various business units throughout the organization, and believes they will only have a nominal impact.
Flood Insurance Reform.
The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), as amended by the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, modified the National Flood Insurance Program by: (i) increasing the maximum civil penalty for Flood Disaster Protection Act violations to $2,000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap; (ii) requiring certain lenders (including Comerica) to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate; (iii) directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability; (iv) amending the force placement requirement provisions; and (v) permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage. These requirements will impact Comerica loans and extensions of credit secured with residential improved real estate. The civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately.
On July 21, 2015, certain federal agencies issued a joint final rule exempting: (1) detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and (2) HELOCs, business purpose loans, nonperforming loans, loans with terms of less than one year, loans for co-ops and condominiums, andsubordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements. Additionally, the final rule requires Comerica to escrow  flood insurance payments and offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums on residential improved real estate securing a loan, effective January 1, 2016. The federal agencies will address the private flood insurance provisions of the Biggert-Waters Act in a separate rulemaking. Comerica will continue to monitor the development and implementation of the private flood insurance rules.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Measures The environment in which financial institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, and changes in fiscal policy, may have long-term effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot  be foreseen. Moreover, in light of recent events and current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, Congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of Comerica.
UNDERWRITING APPROACH The loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk, so proper loan underwriting is critical to Comerica's long-term financial success. Comerica extends credit to businesses, individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles 10 Table of Contents and consistent with prudent banking practice. During the loan underwriting process, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed, and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated. Important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include:  People: Including the competence, integrity and succession planning of customers.
Purpose: The legal, logical and productive purposes of the credit facility.
Payment: Including the source, timing and probability of payment.
Protection: Including obtaining alternative sources of repayment, securing the loan, as appropriate, with collateral and/or third-party guarantees and ensuring appropriate legal documentation is obtained.
Perspective: The risk/reward relationship and pricing elements (cost of funds; servicing costs; time value of money; credit risk).
Comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk, the related costs and the expected return, while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions. Loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected risk-adjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrower's ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates.
Credit Administration Comerica maintains a Credit Administration Department (Credit Administration) which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio. Credit Administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis, including an assessment of the borrower's business model, balance sheet, cash flow and collateral. Each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by Credit Administration. Further, Credit Administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available, either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance. The goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve Comerica's risk management capability, including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio, predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk.
Credit Policy Comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies. Comerica's credit policies provide individual relationship managers, as well as loan committees, approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and Comerica's legal lending limit. Credit Administration, in conjunction with the businesses units, monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary. New or modified policies/guidelines require approval by the Strategic Credit Committee, chaired by Comerica's Chief Credit Officer and comprising senior credit, market and risk management executives.
Commercial Loan Portfolio Commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower's operations. The underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below:  The borrower's business model.
Periodic review of financial statements including financial statements audited by an independent certified public accountant when appropriate.
The pro-forma financial condition including financial projections.
The borrower's sources and uses of funds.
The borrower's debt service capacity.
The guarantor's financial strength.
A comprehensive review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, to determine the advance rates.
Physical inspection of collateral and audits of receivables, as appropriate.

11 Table of Contents Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Loan Portfolio Comerica's CRE loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate developers and loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Comerica's CRE loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators. Our loan-to-value limitations are, in certain cases, more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. CRE loans generally require cash equity. CRE loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. There are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor.
Consumer and Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolios Comerica's consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above, but also includes an assessment of each borrower's personal financial condition, including a review of credit reports and related FICO scores (a type of credit score used to assess an applicant's credit risk) and verification of income and assets. Comerica does not originate subprime loan programs. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, Comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors. These credit factors include low FICO scores, poor patterns of payment history, high debt-to-income ratios and elevated loan-to-value. We generally consider subprime FICO scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis (excluding loans with cash or near-cash collateral and adequate income to make payments) and below 660 for unsecured loans. Residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based. The remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market. Adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs.
EMPLOYEES As of December31, 2015 , Comerica and its subsidiaries had 8,533 full-time and 570 part-time employees.

Local, domestic, and international events including economic, financial market, political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as or related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts and other factors, such as real estate values, energy prices, state and local municipal budget deficits, government spending and the U.S. national debt, outside of our control may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect Comerica. As was the case with the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's earnings.
Governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry, and therefore impact Comerica's financial condition and results of operations.
Monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the FRB, affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part Comerica's cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments. Changes in such policies, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the value of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond Comerica's control and difficult to predict. Comerica's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies.
Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operations.
Comerica is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the U.S. Treasury, the Texas Department of Banking, the FDIC, the FRB, the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which Comerica may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on Comerica's operations, investigations and limitations related to Comerica's securities, the classification of Comerica's assets and determination of the level of Comerica's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.
In particular, Congress and other regulators have significantly increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Their actions include, but are not limited to, the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, many parts of which are now in effect, and the adoption of the Basel III framework in the U.S. For additional information on these actions, please see The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Other Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments section of the Supervisory and Regulation section of this report. Many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III framework remain subject to regulatory rule-making and/or implementation, the effects of which are not yet known.
Additionally, Comerica may be subject to other regulatory actions that are currently under consideration, or may be under consideration in the future. For example, should U.S. banking regulators establish any additional capital buffers (for example, for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the U.S. financial system), Comerica may be subject to those additional requirements. Further, the current administration proposed in January 2010 a fee on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system. Calls for that fee were renewed during the 2013 federal budget discussions. Most recently, the administration's 2015 budget proposal would impose a 7 basis point tax on U.S. financial firms with assets over $50 billion, with the goal of such proposal to penalize financial institutions for being overly leveraged.  If such fee or another similar fee were implemented, Comerica would likely be subject to its terms.
The effects of such legislation and regulatory actions on Comerica cannot reliably be fully determined at this time. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on Comerica's businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect Comerica.
13 Table of Contents  Comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations, support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities.
Comericas liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms.
Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect Comericas liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, Comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; counterparty availability; interest rate fluctuations; general economic conditions; and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which Comerica has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. Further, Comerica's customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions, which could have a negative impact on Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.
In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the final rule, Comerica is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality, liquid assets ("HQLA") to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule is effective for Comerica on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, Comerica will be required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. For more information regarding the LCR, please see the Supervision and Regulation section of this report.  The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our level of regulatory-qualifying capital and ability to continue to comply with the LCR framework.
Further, if Comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms, or if Comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, Comericas liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Compliance with more stringent capital and liquidity requirements may adversely affect Comerica.
While new capital and liquidity requirements in connection with Basel III and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been largely implemented, continued compliance by Comerica and its subsidiary banks with these restrictions will have an effect on Comerica. Additional information on the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements currently applicable to Comerica is set forth in the Supervision and Regulation section of this report. In light of these or other new legal and regulatory requirements, Comerica and our subsidiary banks are, and will be in the future, required to satisfy additional, more stringent capital and liquidity standards, including annual and mid-year stress testing and quantitative standards for liquidity management. These requirements, and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity, could adversely affect Comerica's ability to pay dividends or make equity repurchases, or could require Comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition and/or existing shareholders.
Further, our regulators may also require us to satisfy additional, more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the Dodd-Frank Act and the FRB's proposed and final rules implementing Basel III.
Maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce Comerica's profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Declines in the businesses or industries of Comerica's customers - in particular, the energy industry - could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances, which could adversely affect Comerica.
Comerica's business customer base consists, in part, of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry, the automotive production industry and the real estate business. These industries are sensitive to global economic conditions, supply chain factors and/or commodities prices. Any decline in one of those customers' businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses, which in turn could adversely affect Comerica. Further, any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings, either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan.
In particular, oil and gas prices have fallen sharply since mid-2014. Loans in the Middle Market - Energy business line were $3.1 billion , or approximately 6 percent of total loans, at December31, 2015 .  At December31, 2015 , the reserve 14 Table of Contents allocation for energy and energy-related loans was over 4 percent of total energy and energy-related loans. Subsequent to December31, 2015 , oil and gas prices dropped significantly, and Comerica saw additional negative migration into criticized loans. If oil and gas prices continue to remain depressed for a prolonged period of time, Comerica's energy portfolio could experience increased credit losses, which could adversely affect Comerica's financial results.  Furthermore, a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the Texas economy, which could have a material adverse effect on Comericas business, financial condition and results of operations.  For more information regarding Comerica's energy portfolio, please see Energy Lending beginning on pageF-31 of the Financial Section of this report.
Unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect Comerica's financial results.
Although Comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Under such circumstances, Comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses, which could adversely affect Comerica's financial results.
Operational difficulties, failure of technology infrastructure or information security incidents could adversely affect Comerica's business and operations.
Comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk, including legal risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, failure of Comerica's controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Given the high volume of transactions at Comerica, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved. The occurrence of such operational risks can lead to other types of risks including reputational and compliance risks that may amplify the adverse impact to Comerica.
In particular, Comerica's operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in Comerica's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.
Comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, cyber attacks (including cyber attacks resulting in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems), spikes in transaction volume and/or customer activity, electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters. Although Comerica has programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to Comerica. While Comericas website, www.comerica.com , has been subject to denial of service attacks in the last few years, these events did not result in a breach of Comericas client data, and account information remained secure. However, future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and Comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.
The occurrence of any failure or interruption in Comerica's operations or information systems, or any security breach, could cause reputational damage, jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information, result in a loss of customer business, subject Comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica.
Comerica relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its business infrastructure, and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations.
Comerica faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure. Third party vendors provide certain key components of Comerica's business infrastructure, such as data processing and storage, payment processing services, recording and monitoring transactions, internet connections and network access, clearing agency and card processing services. While Comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors, it does not control their operations.  Further, while Comerica has enhanced its vendor management policies and practices to facilitate Comericas compliance with recently updated vendor regulations, these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk. In this context, any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect Comericas business operations, and result in financial loss, reputational harm, and/or regulatory action.
15 Table of Contents  Noninterest expenses are important to our profitability, but are subject to a number of factors, some of which are not in our control.
Many factors can influence the amount of noninterest expenses, including changing regulations, pension and health care costs, technology and cybersecurity investments, outside processing expenses and litigation. The importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the current slow growth, low net interest margin business environment. Comerica's noninterest expenses may increase more than anticipated, which could result in an adverse impact on net income.
Changes in the financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing, could adversely affect Comerica's net interest income and balance sheet.
The operations of financial institutions such as Comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions, the trade, fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions' net interest income. Interest rates over the past several years have remained at low levels, even following the Federal Open Market Committee's 25 basis point rate rise in December. A continued low interest rate environment may continue to adversely affect the interest income Comerica earns on loans and investments. For a discussion of Comerica's interest rate sensitivity, please see, Market and Liquidity Risk beginning on pageF-33 of the Financial Section of this report.
Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. Comerica's financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions.
Reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect Comerica and/or the holders of its securities.
Rating agencies regularly evaluate Comerica, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including Comerica's financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that Comerica will maintain its current ratings. In February 2016, Standard & Poor's downgraded Comerica's long-term senior credit ratings one notch to BBB+ and Comerica Bank's long and short-term credit ratings one notch to A- and A-2, respectively, and maintained its "Negative" outlook. In March 2015, Moody's Investors Service put global bank ratings on review following the publication of revised bank rating methodology and in May 2015, it downgraded Comerica Bank's long-term senior credit ratings one notch to A3. In February 2016, Moody's revised its outlook to "Negative."  While recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets, future downgrades to Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could adversely affect Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on Comerica's results of operations or financial condition. If such a reduction placed Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings below investment grade, it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase Comerica's costs under such arrangements. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by Comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Comerica.
Comerica's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led, and may further lead, to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose Comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, Comerica's credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to Comerica. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect, possible materially in nature, Comerica.
The introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect Comerica's business.
Comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products. If Comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs, it could result in Comerica incurring 16 Table of Contents significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in a material adverse effect on its business.
Damage to Comericas reputation could damage its businesses.
With consumers increasingly interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust, reputational risk is an increasing concern for business. Such risks include compliance issues, operational challenges, or a strategic, high profile event. Comerica's business is based on the trust of its customers, communities, and entire value chain, which makes managing reputational risk extremely important. News or other publicity that impairs Comerica's reputation, or the reputation of the financial services industry generally, can therefore cause significant harm to Comericas business and prospects. Further, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding Comerica, whether or not true, may result in harm to Comericas prospects.
Comerica may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market, and deliver new products and services to its customers.
The financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Comerica's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands, meet regulatory requirements, and create additional efficiencies in Comerica's operations. Comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's financial condition and results of operations.
Competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within Comerica's markets may change.
Comerica operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates. Comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions. Some of Comerica's larger competitors, including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in Comerica's market area, may make available to their customers a broader array of product, pricing and structure alternatives and, due to their asset size, may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio. Some of Comerica's competitors (larger or smaller) may have more liberal lending policies and processes.
Additionally, the financial services industry has recently been subject to increasing regulation. For more information, see the Supervision and Regulation section of this report. Such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology, personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions, including Comerica, to engage in certain activities. Comerica's competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered. They may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure.
If Comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets, business could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in customer behavior may adversely impact Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Comerica uses a variety of financial tools, models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Comerica's control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect Comerica's ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements.
Further, difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels. A decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Comerica, Comerica's customers and others in the financial institutions industry.
Any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to Comerica's business and operations.
Difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent Comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition, or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected.
17 Table of Contents Further, the assimilation of the acquired entity's customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of Comerica's businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect Comerica's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. These matters could have an adverse effect on Comerica for an undetermined period. Comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of Comerica.
Management's ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.
The financial services industry is very competitive. Comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers, but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. While management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships, Comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers. Failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact Comerica's earnings.
Management's ability to retain key officers and employees may change.
Comerica's future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel. Comerica's future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and Comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for Comerica to hire personnel over time.
Further, Comerica's ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. On April 14, 2011, FRB, OCC and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement Section956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section956 requires the regulators to issue regulations that prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $1 billion, and would impose heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes Comerica. For these larger institutions, the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of incentive-based payments be deferred over a minimum period of three years for designated executives. Moreover, boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institution's size, capital or overall risk tolerance, and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards. Accordingly, Comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions (as referenced above) or companies in other industries, which may not be subject to the same requirements.
Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, or Comerica's inability to attract and retain skilled employees.
Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving Comerica and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect Comerica or the financial services industry in general.
Comerica has been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that Comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of Comerica's efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by Comerica's regulators that could materially adversely affect Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could adversely affect Comerica's results of operations and financial condition.
Methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective.
Instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated. As a 18 Table of Contents result, Comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Terrorist activities or other hostilities may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica.
Terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt Comerica's operations or those of its customers. In addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm Comerica's operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm Comerica's stock price and may limit the capital resources available to Comerica and its customers. This could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of Comerica's common stock.
Catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica.
Comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in California, Texas, Florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods. These types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, Comerica's business and customers and have posed physical risks to Comerica's property. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on Comerica's customers and in turn, on Comerica. A significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect Comerica's operating results.
Changes in accounting standards could materially impact Comerica's financial statements.
From time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Comerica's financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how Comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings.
Comerica's accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.
Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how Comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with U.S. GAAP. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in the Company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.
Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. Comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding management's judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, Comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements. See Critical Accounting Policies on pagesF-40 through F-43 of the Financial Section of this report and Note1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on pagesF-51 through F-63 of the Financial Section of this report.

F-3 Table of Contents 2015 OVERVIEW AND 2016 OUTLOOK Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is a financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Corporation's major business segments are the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. The core businesses are tailored to each of the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. Information about the activities of the Corporation's business segments is provided in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
As a financial institution, the Corporation's principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals.  The primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. The Corporation also provides other products and services that meet the financial needs of customers which generate noninterest income, the Corporation's secondary source of revenue. Growth in loans, deposits and noninterest income is affected by many factors, including economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers, and the ability to add new customers and/or increase the number of products used by current customers.  Success in providing products and services depends on the financial needs of customers and the types of products desired.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.).  The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  The most critical of these significant accounting policies are discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this financial review.
OVERVIEW  Net income was $521 million in 2015 , a decrease of $72 million , or 12 percent , compared to $593 million in 2014 . Net income per diluted common share was $2.84 in 2015 , compared to $3.16 in 2014 . The most significant items contributing to the decrease in net income are described below.
Average loans were $48.6 billion in 2015 , an increase of $2.0 billion , or 4 percent , compared to 2014 . The increase in average loans primarily reflected an increase of $1.8 billion , or 6 percent , in commercial loans, $174 million , or 8 percent , in consumer loans and $100 million , or 6 percent in residential mortgage loans. The increase in commercial loans primarily reflected increases in Mortgage Banker Finance, Technology and Life Sciences, National Dealer Services and Small Business, partially offset by a decrease in Corporate Banking.
Average deposits increased $3.5 billion , or 6 percent , to $58.3 billion in 2015 , compared to 2014 . The increase in average deposits reflected increases of $3.1 billion , or 12 percent , in average noninterest-bearing deposits and $1.2 billion , or 5 percent , in money market and interest-bearing checking deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $660 million , or 14 percent , in customer certificates of deposit. The increase in average deposits reflected increases in almost all lines of business and in all geographic markets.
Net interest income was $1.7 billion in 2015 , an increase of $34 million , or 2 percent , compared to 2014 .  The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from an increase in average earning assets of $3.6 billion , partially offset by a $27 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, continued pressure on yields from the low-rate environment and loan portfolio dynamics.
The provision for credit losses was $147 million in 2015 , an increase of $120 million compared to 2014 , primarily reflecting increased provisions for Energy and energy-related loans, Technology and Life Sciences, Corporate Banking and Small Business, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net loan charge-offs were $100 million , or 0.21 percent of average loans, for 2015 , an increase of $75 million compared to 2014 , primarily reflecting increases in Energy, general Middle Market (largely due to an increase in charge-offs on energy-related loans), Small Business, Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by a decrease in Private Banking.
Noninterest income increased $182 million or 21 percent , in 2015 , compared to 2014 . Excluding a $181 million impact from a change in accounting presentation for a card program, noninterest income increased $1 million . Increases in card fees, service charges on deposit accounts and fiduciary income were largely offset by lower investment banking income, lower fee income on certain categories impacted by regulatory changes and decreases in several non-fee categories.
Noninterest expenses increased $216 million , or 13 percent , in 2015 , compared to 2014 . Excluding the $181 million impact from a change in accounting presentation for a card program and the benefit to 2015 from the release of $33 million of litigation reserves in the second and third quarters, noninterest expenses increased $68 million , or 4 percent , primarily due to increases in technology and regulatory expenses, outside processing fees and pension expense, partially offset by cost savings realized in 2015 from certain actions taken in the second half of 2014.
The quarterly dividend was increased to 21 cents per share, or 5 percent, in April 2015.
The Corporation repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares and 500,000 warrants in 2015 under the equity repurchase program. Together with dividends of $0.83 per share, $389 million , or 75 percent of 2015 net income, was returned to shareholders.
F-4 Table of Contents 2016 OUTLOOK Management expectations for 2016 , compared to 2015 , assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment, are as follows:  Average loans modestly higher, in line with Gross Domestic Product growth, reflecting a continued decline in Energy more than offset by increases in most other lines of business.
Net interest income higher, reflecting the benefits from the December 2015 short-term rate increase, loan growth and a larger securities portfolio more than offsetting higher funding costs.
Full-year benefit from the December rise in short-term rates expected to be more than $90 million if deposit prices remain at current levels.
Provision for credit losses higher, with an estimated impact of $75 million to $125 million for energy and energy-related exposure, recognized primarily in the first quarter. Continued improvements in the remainder of the portfolio provide a partial offset.
Net charge-offs in line with historical normal levels.
Noninterest income modestly higher, primarily due to growth in card fees from merchant processing services, government card and commercial card. Continued focus on cross-sell opportunities, including wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services.
Noninterest expenses higher, reflecting continued increases in technology costs and regulatory expenses, increased outside processing in line with growing revenue, higher FDIC insurance expense due to recent regulatory proposal, and typical inflationary pressures. Additionally, 2015 benefited from a $33 million legal reserve release, which is offset by lower pension expense in 2016.
Income tax expense to approximate 32 percent of pre-tax income.
F-5 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following provides a comparative discussion of the Corporation's consolidated results of operations for 2015 compared to 2014 .  A comparative discussion of results for 2014 compared to 2013 is provided at the end of this section.

NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. FTE adjustments are made to the yields on tax-exempt assets in order to present tax-exempt income and fully taxable income on a comparable basis. FTE adjustments totaled $4 million in both 2015 and 2014 and $3 million in 2013 . Gains and losses related to the effective portion of risk management interest rate swaps that qualify as hedges are included with the interest expense of the hedged item. Net interest income on a FTE basis comprised 62 percent of total revenues in 2015 and 66 percent in both 2014 and 2013 . The decrease in 2015 is due to an increase in noninterest income as described under the "Noninterest Income" subheading below. The Analysis of Net Interest Income-Fully Taxable Equivalent table of this financial review provides an analysis of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 . The rate-volume analysis in the table above details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013 .
Net interest income was $1.7 billion in 2015 , an increase of $34 million compared to 2014 . The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from higher earning asset volume, partially offset by lower loan and investment yields, in part due to a $27 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio and continued pressure on yields from the low-rate environment and changing loan portfolio dynamics. Average earning assets increased $3.6 billion , or 6 percent , primarily reflecting increases of $2.0 billion in average loans, $887 million in average investment securities and $645 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. Funding costs remained unchanged with lower interest expense on deposits, primarily due to lower time deposit balances, offset by an increase in interest expense on debt, primarily due to an increase in the portfolio average rate, largely as a result of the impact of maturities and new issues.
The net interest margin (FTE) in 2015 decreased 10 basis points to 2.60 percent , from 2.70 percent in 2014 , primarily due to lower loan yields and an increase in average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), partially offset by higher average loan balances. The decrease in loan yields primarily reflected unfavorable portfolio dynamics and a decrease in F-7 Table of Contents accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, shifts in the average loan portfolio mix and the impact of a competitive low-rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from an increase in LIBOR rates. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point in 2015 , compared to 6 basis points in 2014 . Average balances deposited with the FRB were $6.0 billion and $5.4 billion in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and are included in interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Corporation utilizes various asset and liability management strategies to manage net interest income exposure to interest rate risk. Refer to the Market and Liquidity Risk section of this financial review for additional information regarding the Corporation's asset and liability management policies.
PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses was $147 million in 2015 , compared to $27 million in 2014 . The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.
The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $142 million in 2015 , an increase of $120 million compared to $22 million in 2014 , primarily reflecting increased provisions for Energy and energy-related loans, Technology and Life Sciences, Corporate Banking and Small Business.
Net loan charge-offs in 2015 increased $75 million to $100 million , or 0.21 percent of average total loans, compared to $25 million , or 0.05 percent , in 2014 . The increase primarily reflected increases in Energy, general Middle Market (largely due to an increase in charge-offs on energy-related loans), Small Business (primarily due to the charge-off of a single large credit in 2015), Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by an increase in net recoveries in Private Banking.
The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $5 million in both 2015 and 2014 . Lending-related commitment charge-offs were $1 million in 2015 and insignificant in 2014 .
For further discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, including the methodology used in the determination of the allowances and an analysis of the changes in the allowances, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and the "Credit Risk" section of this financial review.
NONINTEREST INCOME (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Card fees $ 290 $ 92 $ 86 Card fees excluding presentation change (a) 109 92 86 Service charges on deposit accounts 223 215 214 Fiduciary income 187 180 171 Commercial lending fees 99 98 99 Letter of credit fees 53 57 64 Bank-owned life insurance 40 39 40 Foreign exchange income 40 40 36 Brokerage fees 17 17 17 Net securities losses (2 )  (1 ) Other noninterest income (b) 103 130 156 Total noninterest income $ 1,050 $ 868 $ 882 Total noninterest income excluding presentation change (a) $ 869 $ 868 $ 882 (a) Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was an increase of $181 million to card fees in 2015 . The Corporation believes that this information will assist investors, regulators, management and others in comparing results to prior periods.
(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.
Noninterest income increased $182 million to $1.1 billion in 2015 , compared to $868 million in 2014 . Excluding the $181 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on card fees as described in footnote (a) to the above table, noninterest income increased $1 million . An analysis of significant year over year changes by individual line item follows.
Card fees consist primarily of interchange and other fees earned on government card programs, commercial cards and debit/ATM cards, as well as, beginning in 2015, fees from providing merchant payment processing services. Card fees increased $198 million to $290 million in 2015 , compared to $92 million in 2014 . Two significant developments impacted the comparability of card fees between 2014 and 2015. First, as referenced in footnote (a) to the table above, the Corporation entered into a new F-8 Table of Contents contract for an existing government card program effective January 1, 2015. Changes to the terms of the contract resulted in a change to the presentation of the related revenue and expenses. In 2015, under the current contract, total revenue before related expenses was recorded in card fees, and related expenses were recorded in outside processing fee expense; whereas in 2014, under the terms of the prior contract, revenue was recorded in card fees net of the related expenses. The impact of this presentation change was a $181 million increase to card fees in 2015. Second, the Corporation changed its business model for providing merchant payment processing services. Previously, the Corporation's merchant payment processing revenue was earned through a joint venture, and the revenue was recorded in other noninterest income net of related expenses. The Corporation's participation in the joint venture concluded in the second quarter 2015. The net revenue from the joint venture included in other noninterest income was $3 million in 2015, compared to $14 million in 2014. The Corporation now directly enters into agreements with its merchant customers and records merchant services revenue in card fees ( $17 million in 2015 , zero in 2014) before the related expenses. A third party processes the transactions, and such processing expenses are recorded in outside processing fee expense ( $16 million in 2015, $1 million in 2014, both years include start-up expenses). After adjusting for the $181 million impact of the contractual change to a government card program and the $17 million impact from the change to the Corporation's business model for providing merchant payment processing services, card fees were stable. For further information about the impact of the change to the merchant payment processing business model, refer to the "other noninterest income" discussion below and the "outside processing fee expense" discussion under the "Noninterest Expenses" subheading that follows.
Service charges on deposit accounts increased $8 million , or 4 percent , to $223 million in 2015 , compared to $215 million in 2014 . The increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in commercial service charges.
Fiduciary income increased $7 million , or 4 percent , to $187 million in 2015 , compared to $180 million in 2014 . Personal trust fees, institutional trust fees and investment advisory fees are the three major components of fiduciary income. These fees are based on services provided, assets under management and assets under administration. Fluctuations in the market values of the underlying assets managed or administered, which include both equity and fixed income securities, and net asset flows within client accounts, impact fiduciary income. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in investment advisory fees, largely driven by net asset inflows, as brokerage clients continue to transition from transactional services to investment advisory services, and the favorable impact on fees from market value increases.
Letter of credit fees decreased $4 million , or 7 percent , to $53 million in 2015 , compared to $57 million in 2014 . The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to regulatory-driven decreases in the volume of letters of credit outstanding.
Other noninterest income decreased $27 million , or 21 percent , to $103 million in 2015 , compared to $130 million in 2014 . The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of income.
(in millions) Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Customer derivative income $ 18 $ 22 $ 25 Investment banking fees 12 18 19 Insurance commissions 10 13 14 Securities trading income 9 9 14 Income from principal investing and warrants 6 10 14 Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries 2 8 10 Deferred compensation asset returns (a)  6 13 All other noninterest income 46 44 47 Other noninterest income $ 103 $ 130 $ 156 ( a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting change in liability is reported in salaries and benefits expense.
The decrease in other noninterest income primarily reflected decreases in investment banking fees, income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and deferred compensation plan asset returns. The decline in investment banking fees was largely due to decreased activity in the energy markets. Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries reflected the decrease of $11 million in income from the merchant payment processing joint venture that concluded in the second quarter 2015, as described further in the discussion of "card fees" above, partially offset by a decrease in tax credit investment amortization expense. The decrease in deferred compensation asset returns was offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense in salaries and benefits expense.
F-9 Table of Contents NONINTEREST EXPENSES (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Salaries and benefits expense 1,009 980 1,009 Outside processing fee expense 332 122 119 Outside processing fee expense excluding presentation change (a) 151 122 119 Net occupancy expense 159 171 160 Equipment expense 53 57 60 Software expense 99 95 90 FDIC insurance expense 37 33 33 Advertising expense 24 23 21 Litigation-related expense (32 ) 4 52 Gain on debt redemption  (32 ) (1 ) Other noninterest expenses 161 173 179 Total noninterest expenses $ 1,842 $ 1,626 $ 1,722 Total noninterest expenses excluding presentation change (a) $ 1,661 $ 1,626 $ 1,722 (a) Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was an increase of $181 million to outside processing fee expense in 2015 . The Corporation believes that this information will assist investors, regulators, management and others in comparing results to prior periods.
Noninterest expenses increased $216 million to $1.8 billion in 2015 , compared to $1.6 billion in 2014 . Excluding the $181 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on outside processing fees as described in footnote (a) to the above table, noninterest expenses increased $35 million , or 2 percent , in 2015 . Included in the $35 million increase was a $15 million increase in outside processing expense associated with the change in the Corporation's business model for providing merchant payment processing services, as previously described under the "Noninterest Income" subheading above and further discussed below. An analysis of significant increases and decreases by individual line item is presented below.
Salaries and benefits expense increased $29 million , or 3 percent , to $1.0 billion in 2015 , compared to $980 million in 2014 . The increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected an increase in technology-related contract labor expenses,  the impact of merit increases and higher defined benefit pension expense, partially offset by decreases in deferred compensation plan expense and lower severance and executive incentive compensation expense. An $8 million increase in pension expense was primarily due to the impact of changes to plan assumptions, including a decrease in the discount rate and a change in mortality assumptions, partially offset by the benefit of a $350 million contribution to the pension plan in the December 2014. The Corporation's incentive programs are designed to reward performance and provide market competitive total compensation opportunity. Business unit incentives are tied to various financial and strategic business objectives, while executive incentives are tied to the Corporation's overall performance and peer-based comparisons of results.
Outside processing fee expense increased $210 million to $332 million in 2015 , compared to $122 million in 2014 . Excluding the $181 million impact of the above-described change in accounting presentation, outside processing fee expense increased $29 million , or 24 percent , compared to 2014 . The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in third-party processing expenses associated with the change in the Corporation's business model for providing merchant payment processing services, including up-front costs incurred for converting customers to the new vendor providing the services, as well as an increase associated with a retirement savings program and smaller increases in other outside processing expenses related to revenue-generating activities.
Under the previous joint venture business model for merchant services, revenue was recorded net of related expenses, whereas under the new business model, expenses are recorded in outside processing fees.
Net occupancy and equipment expense decreased $16 million , or 7 percent , to $212 million in 2015 , compared to $228 million in 2014 . The decrease was primarily the result of lease termination charges of $10 million taken in 2014 as well as the 2015 benefit from those real estate optimization actions.
Litigation-related expense decreased $36 million in 2015 , reflecting the release of $33 million of litigation reserves in the second and third quarters of 2015. For further information about legal proceedings, refer to Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Corporation recognized a gain on debt redemption of $32 million in 2014 , on the early redemption of a $150 million subordinated note in the third quarter 2014 , primarily from the recognition of the unamortized value of a related, previously terminated interest rate swap.
Other noninterest expenses decrease d $12 million , or 7 percent , to $161 million in 2015 , from $173 million in 2014 , primarily reflecting a decrease in contributions to the Comerica Charitable Foundation in 2015 .
F-10 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES AND RELATED ITEMS The provision for income taxes was $229 million in 2015 , compared to $277 million in 2014 .  The $48 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in 2015 , compared to 2014 , was due primarily to the decrease in pretax income as well as a $5 million tax benefit from the early termination of certain leveraged leases.
Net deferred tax assets were $199 million at December31, 2015 , compared to $130 million at December31, 2014 . The increase of $69 million resulted primarily from decreases in deferred tax liabilities related to lease financing transactions and net unrealized gains on investment securities available-for-sale, as well as an increase deferred tax assets related to the allowance for loan losses. Deferred tax assets of $429 million were evaluated for realization and it was determined that a valuation allowance of $3 million , related to state net operating loss carryforwards, was needed at December31, 2015 . There was no valuation allowance at December31, 2014 . These conclusions were based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events.
2014 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2013 Net interest income was $1.7 billion in 2014 , a decrease of $17 million compared to 2013 . The decrease in net interest income in 2014 resulted primarily from a $15 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio. The benefits from a $2.5 billion, or 4 percent, increase in average earning assets and lower funding costs were offset by lower loan yields. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.2 billion in average loans and $583 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a decrease of $287 million in average investment securities.
The net interest margin (FTE) in 2014 decreased 14 basis points to 2.70 percent , from 2.84 percent in 2013 , primarily from decreased yields on loans and an increase in lower yielding FRB deposits, partially offset by lower deposit rates. The decrease in loan yields reflected the impact of a competitive rate environment, a decrease in accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, positive credit quality migration throughout the portfolio, lower LIBOR rates and the impact of a $9 million residual value adjustment to assets in the leasing portfolio. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 6 basis points in 2014 , compared to 8 basis points in 2013 . Average balances deposited with the FRB were $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are included in interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated balance sheets. The "Analysis of Net Interest Income  - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE)" and "Rate/Volume Analysis - FTE" tables under the "Net Interest Income" subheading in this section above provide an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for 2014 and 2013 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for 2014 compared to 2013 .
The provision for credit losses, which includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, was $27 million in 2014 , compared to $46 million in 2013 . The provision for loan losses was $22 million in 2014 compared to $42 million in 2013 . Credit quality in the loan portfolio continued to improve in 2014 , compared to 2013 . Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $367 million in the Corporation's criticized loan list from 2013 to 2014 . Reflected in the decline in criticized loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $77 million. Net loan charge-offs in 2014 decreased $48 million to $25 million , or 0.05 percent of average total loans, compared to $73 million, or 0.16 percent, in 2013 . The $48 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in 2014 , compared to 2013 , reflected decreases in almost all business lines, with the largest decreases in Commercial Real Estate and general Middle Market, partially offset by an increase in Technology and Life Sciences. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $5 million in 2014 , compared to $4 million in 2013 . Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant in 2014 and 2013 .
Noninterest income decreased $14 million to $868 million in 2014 , compared to $882 million in 2013 . Fiduciary income increased $9 million , or 6 percent in 2014 , primarily due to an increase in personal trust fees, largely driven by an increase in the volume of fiduciary services sold and the favorable impact on fees of market value increases. Card fees increased $6 million , or 6 percent in 2014 , primarily reflecting a volume-driven increase in commercial charge card interchange revenue. Letter of credit fees decreased $7 million , or 12 percent in 2014 , primarily due to regulatory-driven decreases in the volume of letters of credit outstanding. Foreign exchange income increased $4 million , or 9 percent, in 2014 , primarily due to an increase in customer trading volume throughout the year. Other noninterest income decreased $26 million , or 16 percent, in 2014 , compared to 2013 . The decrease primarily reflected decreases in deferred compensation plan asset returns, income recognized from the Corporation's third-party credit card provider, securities trading income and income from principal investing and warrants. The decrease in deferred compensation plan asset returns was offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense in salaries and benefits expense. The decrease in income from the Corporation's third-party credit card provider was primarily the result of a change in the timing of the recognition of incentives from annually to quarterly in 2013. Refer to the table provided under the Noninterest Income subheading previously in this section for the details of certain categories included in other noninterest income.
Noninterest expenses decreased $96 million , or 2 percent, in 2014 , compared to 2013 . Salaries and benefits expense decreased $29 million , or 3 percent, in 2014 , primarily due to decreases in pension and deferred compensation expense, partially offset by the impact of merit increases and an increase in technology-related contract labor expense. Net occupancy and equipment F-11 Table of Contents expense increased $8 million , or 4 percent, in 2014 , primarily the result of lease termination charges of $10 million taken in 2014 related to real estate optimization. Software expense increased $5 million , or 6 percent, in 2014 , primarily due to an increase in amortization expense as a result of the completion of technology projects throughout the year. Litigation-related expenses decreased $48 million in 2014 , primarily as a result of the recognition of a $52 million unfavorable jury verdict on a lender liability case in 2013. The Corporation recognized a gain on debt redemption of $32 million in 2014 on the early redemption of a $150 million subordinated note, primarily from the recognition of the unamortized value of a related, previously terminated interest rate swap. Other noninterest expenses decreased $6 million , or 4 percent, in 2014 , primarily reflecting decreases of $5 million in other real estate expense and $5 million in losses on other foreclosed property, partially offset by an increase of $9 million in charitable contributions to the Comerica Charitable Foundation in 2014.
The provision for income taxes increased $32 million to $277 million in 2014 , primarily due to an increase in pretax income.
F-12 Table of Contents STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS The Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the years ended December31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.
In the second quarter 2014, the Corporation enhanced the approach used to determine the standard reserve factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment. The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses. However, because standard reserves are allocated to the segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly. As a result, the current year provision for credit losses within each segment is not comparable to prior year amounts.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

The Business Bank's net income of $765 million in 2015 decreased $57 million , compared to $822 million in 2014 . Net interest income (FTE) of $1.5 billion increased $4 million in 2015 , primarily the result of the benefit from an increase in average loans of $1.7 billion and the funds transfer pricing (FTP) benefit from a $2.4 billion increase in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, lower loan yields and a lower FTP crediting rate. The increase in average loans primarily reflected increases in Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Commercial Real Estate, partially offset by a decrease in Corporate Banking. Average deposits increased in nearly all lines of business, with the largest increases in general Middle Market, Technology and Life Sciences, Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate. The provision for credit losses increased $102 million , to $158 million in 2015 , compared to the prior year. The increase in the provision primarily reflected increased reserves for loans related to energy, as a result of stress in the energy and energy-related portfolio as a result of sustained lower energy prices. Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences also contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net loan charge-offs of $89 million increased $73 million in 2015 , compared to 2014 , primarily reflecting increases in Energy, general Middle Market (largely due to an increase in charge-offs on energy-related loans), Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences.

Noninterest expenses of $305 million in 2015 decreased $5 million from the prior year, primarily due to a $5 million decrease in litigation-related expenses.
The net loss in the Finance segment was $375 million in 2015 , compared to a net loss of $357 million in 2014 .

The Corporation periodically conducts stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the Corporation's forecasted financial condition under various economic scenarios and business conditions. These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of CCAR. For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.
The U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (Basel III) became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015. Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement; sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), a standardized approach and an advanced approach; introduces two new capital buffers, a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer (applicable to advanced approach entities); establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio (applicable to advanced approach entities); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital phase in and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018.  The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
Under Basel III, CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders' equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards.  Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III.  Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock.  Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses.  Certain deductions and adjustments to CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital are subject to phase-in through December 31, 2017.
The Corporation computes RWA using the standardized approach.  Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class.  Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors.

F-23 Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT As a result of conducting business in the normal course, the Corporation assumes various types of risk. The Corporation's enterprise risk framework provides a process for identifying, measuring, controlling and managing these risks. This framework incorporates a risk assessment process, a collection of risk committees that manage the Corporation's major risk elements, and a risk appetite statement that outlines the levels and types of risks the Corporation accepts. The Corporation continuously enhances its enterprise risk framework with additional processes, tools and systems designed to not only provide management with deeper insight into the Corporation's various existing and emerging risks in accordance with its appetite for risk, but also to improve the Corporation's ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken.
The Corporations front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day to day management of risks including the identification, assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business.  Risks are further monitored, measured and controlled by the second line of defense, specialized risk managers for each of the major risk categories who aid in the identification, measurement, and control of organizational risks.  The majority of these risk managers report into the Office of Enterprise Risk. The Office of Enterprise Risk, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for designing and managing the Corporations enterprise risk framework and ensures effective risk management oversight. Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks which may have risk interdependencies or where risk levels may be nearing the limits outlined in the Corporations risk appetite statement. These committees comprise senior and executive management that represent views from both the lines of business and risk management. Internal Audit, the third line of defense, monitors and assesses the overall effectiveness of the risk management framework on an ongoing basis and provides an independent assessment of the Corporations ability to manage and control risk to management and the Audit Committee of the Board.
The Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee, established by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board, is responsible for governance over the risk management framework, providing oversight in managing the Corporation's aggregate risk position and reporting on the comprehensive portfolio of risks as well as the potential impact these risks can have on the Corporation's risk profile and resulting capital level. The Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee is principally composed of senior officers and executives representing the different risk areas and business units who are appointed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.
The Board's Enterprise Risk Committee meets quarterly and is chartered to assist the Board in promoting the best interests of the Corporation by overseeing policies, procedures and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise Risk Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on risk matters facing the Corporation and the financial services industry. These include, but are not limited to, existing and emerging risk matters related to credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and strategic conditions. A comprehensive risk report is submitted to the Enterprise Risk Committee each quarter providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position.
Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of the Risk Management section in this financial review.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms. The governance structure is administered through the Strategic Credit Committee. The Strategic Credit Committee is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and approves recommendations to address credit risk matters through credit policy, credit risk management practices, and required credit risk actions. The Strategic Credit Committee also ensures a comprehensive reporting of credit risk levels and trends, including exception levels, along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks. In order to facilitate the corporate credit risk management process, various other corporate functions provide the resources for the Strategic Credit Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting, periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using approved credit policies and guidelines. Additionally, the Corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry, customer or guarantor, and selling participations and/or syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties.
Credit Administration manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy and providing business segment reporting support as necessary. The Corporation's Asset Quality Review function, a division of Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups. The Special Assets Group is responsible for managing the recovery process on distressed or defaulted loans and loan sales.
Portfolio Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, provides comprehensive reporting on portfolio credit risk levels and trends, continuous assessment and verification of risk rating models, quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, and calculation of economic credit risk capital.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses.
U.S. economic data at the end of 2015 was mixed, with modest real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth seen throughout the year. U.S. manufacturing faced many opposing forces. Low gasoline prices and strengthening household income supported strong demand for new vehicles. U.S. auto sales reached their highest level in 15 years in 2015, with nearly 17.5 million units sold. However, sustained low oil prices created stress in energy and related industries, and soft global demand, coupled with the strong U.S. dollar, created headwinds for many U.S. manufacturing industries outside of the auto sector. Yet U.S. households are being supported by strong job growth, with the unemployment rate down to 5.0 percent in December. Wage income was up by 4.5 percent over the previous 12 months, while the consumer price index was essentially unchanged for the year due to lower energy prices. Rising incomes, still-low mortgage rates and increasing confidence are supporting new home construction. House prices are rising consistently in most areas, creating wealth for home owners.
An analysis of the coverage of the allowance for loan losses is provided in the following table.
Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at end of year 1.29 % 1.22 % 1.32 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans at end of year 167 205 160 Allowance for loan losses as a multiple of total net loan charge-offs for the year 6.3x 23.5x 8.2x The allowance for loan losses was $634 million at December31, 2015 , compared to $594 million at December31, 2014 , an increase of $40 million , or 7 percent . While the overall quality of the loan portfolio remained solid through the end of 2015,  sustained lower energy prices, economic complexity and uncertainty continued to be a consideration when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Reserves increased, primarily reflecting increases in reserves allocated for energy and energy-related exposure as well as Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder F-25 Table of Contents of the portfolio.  The increase in reserves for energy and energy-related exposure reflected stress in the energy and energy-related portfolio as a result of sustained lower energy prices. Technology and Life Sciences reserves increased largely as a result of the levels and trends of charge-offs.

(b) Loans outstanding as a percentage of total loans.
The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.
The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $45 million at December31, 2015 compared to $41 million at December31, 2014 . The $4 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments primarily reflected the impact of downgrades of energy and energy-related unfunded commitments and issued letters of credit. An analysis of changes in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is presented below.

Commercial Real Estate Lending The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category.
(in millions) December 31 2015 2014 Real estate construction loans: Commercial Real Estate business line (a) $ 1,681 $ 1,606 Other business lines (b) 320 349 Total real estate construction loans $ 2,001 $ 1,955 Commercial mortgage loans: Commercial Real Estate business line (a) $ 2,104 $ 1,790 Other business lines (b) 6,873 6,814 Total commercial mortgage loans $ 8,977 $ 8,604 (a) Primarily loans to real estate developers.
(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.
F-30 Table of Contents The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets, diversifying credit risk by geography and project type, and maintaining conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.0 billion at December31, 2015 , of which $3.8 billion , or 34 percent , were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.2 billion , or 66 percent , of commercial real estate loans is to borrowers in other business lines and consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $2.6 billion at December31, 2015 , of which $1.4 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Substantially all of the remaining $1.2 billion were owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $1.1 billion at December31, 2015 , primarily including $611 million for multifamily projects, $197 million for commercial projects and $88 million for retail projects. No loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line that were secured by properties located in Texas were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2015 .
The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with $1 million on nonaccrual status at December31, 2015 , compared to $2 million on nonaccrual status at December31, 2014 , and real estate construction loan net recoveries of $1 million in 2015 and $4 million in 2014 .
Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.1 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $16 million were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2015 , compared to $1.8 billion with $22 million on nonaccrual status at December31, 2014 . Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $5 million and $8 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In other business lines, $44 million and $73 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and net recoveries were $13 million in 2015 compared to net charge-offs of $2 million in 2014 .
Residential Real Estate Lending The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.
(dollar amounts in millions) 2015 2014 December 31 Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Geographic market: Michigan $ 387 21 % $ 785 46 % $ 417 23 % $ 795 48 % California 874 47 611 35 831 46 564 34 Texas 325 17 269 16 337 18 247 15 Other Markets 284 15 55 3 246 13 52 3 Total $ 1,870 100 % $ 1,720 100 % $ 1,831 100 % $ 1,658 100 % Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.6 billion at December31, 2015 . Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at December31, 2015 , and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $27 million were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2015 . The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at December31, 2015 , of which $1.5 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $131 million were in amortizing status and $56 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $27 million were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2015 . A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at December31, 2015 . The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.
Energy Lending The Corporation has a portfolio of energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies in the oil and gas business. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 200 borrowers at December31, 2015 ) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P), midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations F-31 Table of Contents based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products.  The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment.  About 95 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits.  The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers.
In addition to oil and gas loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to oil and gas or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related'), primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences.  These companies include downstream businesses such as refineries and petrochemical companies, companies that sell products to E&P, midstream and energy services companies, companies involved in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, and other similar businesses.
The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $6.4 billion and $7.1 billion at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of the decline in value of oil and gas reserves, while the decrease in outstandings largely reflected energy customers taking actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt. As of December31, 2015 , a majority of the Corporation's E&P customers had at least 50 percent of their oil and/or gas production hedged up to the end of 2016. The value and coverage benefit of such hedging contracts are dependent upon the underlying oil/gas price in each contract and will be different for each borrower. Approximately 95 percent of the loans outstanding and 90 percent of total exposure in the Energy business line had varying levels and types of collateral at December31, 2015 , including oil and gas reserves and pipelines, equipment, accounts receivable, inventory and other assets, or some combination thereof. Energy-related outstandings were approximately $624 million at December31, 2015 (approximately 110 relationships), a decrease of $156 million , or 20% , compared to December31, 2014 .
Criticized energy and energy-related loans increased from $197 million , or 5 percent of total energy and energy-related loans, at December31, 2014 , to $1.4 billion or 38 percent at December31, 2015 , in part reflecting the Corporation's weighting of current and expected operating cash flows in the assessment of the probability of default. Nonaccrual energy and energy-related loans increased to $161 million , or 4 percent of total energy and energy-related loans at December31, 2015 , compared to $27 million , or 1 percent at December31, 2014 . Energy and energy-related net loan charge-offs were $47 million for the year ended December31, 2015 , with $28 million from the energy portfolio and $19 million from the energy-related portfolio.
The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within its loan portfolio. At December31, 2015 , the reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans was over 4 percent of total energy and energy-related loans. The reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans appropriately incorporated the changing dynamics in energy and energy-related loans described above, including but not limited to, continued negative migration in the portfolio and the value of collateral considered in determining estimated loss given default, which has resulted in increases in reserves for this portfolio for the past five quarterly periods. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for energy and energy-related loans at December31, 2015 , which provided for incurred losses that emerged between the borrower's most recent internal risk rating review and the end of the year, due to the uncertainty associated with continued volatility and impact of sustained lower oil and gas prices. In developing the qualitative adjustment, management considered a range of possible outcomes for probability of default, loss given default and the loss emergence period, as well as historical migration and loss experience under similar economic conditions, based on the conditions that existed at that time.
F-32 Table of Contents Subsequent to December31, 2015 , oil and gas prices dropped significantly, and the Corporation saw additional negative migration into criticized loans after updating the price decks for January 2016 oil prices. The Corporation expects that if current conditions persist, it could result in an estimated additional provision of between $75 million and $125 million, recognized primarily in the first quarter 2016. Net energy and energy-related charge-offs are expected to be manageable.
Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subheading earlier in this section for a discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses as a result of the above-described events.
International Exposure International assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country.
Mexico, with cross-border outstandings of $617 million ( 0.86 percent of total assets), $670 million ( 0.97 percent of total assets) and $645 million (0.99 percent of total assets) at December31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, was the only country with outstandings between 0.75 and 1.00 percent of total assets at year-end 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . There were no countries with cross-border outstandings exceeding 1.00 percent of total assets at year-end 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
The Corporation's international strategy is to focus on international companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets.
The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in Mexico and Europe at December31, 2015 and 2014 .

MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.
The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department mitigates market and liquidity risk through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions under the direction of ALCO.
Market Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analysis and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends F-33 Table of Contents and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.
Interest Rate Risk Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at December31, 2015 , of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.
Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.
Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the first scenario presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the second scenario reflects a decline in short-term interest rates to zero percent.
Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth.  In the +200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth are based on historical experience. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the December31, 2015 +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Investment securities modeling includes the replacement of prepayments as well as an estimate of projected growth in high quality liquid assets (HQLA) needed for compliance with the LCR, and expected funding maturities are included.  In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates and loan spread held at current levels. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.
The table below, as of December31, 2015 and 2014 , displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.
Estimated Annual Change (in millions) 2015 2014 December 31 Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Rising 200 basis points $ 212 12 % $ 224 13 % Declining to zero percent (88 ) (5 ) (32 ) (2 ) Sensitivity decreased modestly from December31, 2014 to December31, 2015 , primarily due to the recent addition of HQLA for the LCR, changes in the current balance sheet mix driving a revised forecast, and the modeled reduction in deposit growth in the +200 scenario discussed above.  The risk to declining interest rates is limited by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent, but reflects the recent rise in short-term interest rates, allowing for a decline of 50 basis points at December 31, 2015, relative to a 25 basis point decline at December 31, 2014.
F-34 Table of Contents The table below, as of December31, 2015 , illustrates the estimated sensitivity of the above results to a change in deposit balance assumptions in the +200 scenario, with all other assumptions held constant. In this analysis, average noninterest-bearing deposit run-off in the 12-month period has been increased by $1 billion and $3 billion from the run-off included in the standard +200 scenario presented above and assumes the deposit run-off reduces excess reserves and increases purchased funds. The analysis is provided as an indicator of the sensitivity of net interest income to the modeled deposit run-off assumption. It is not meant to reflect management's expectation or best estimate. Actual changes in deposit balances may vary from those reflected.

The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 50 basis point decrease in interest rates.
The table below, as of December31, 2015 and 2014 , displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

The change in the declining scenario is most significantly impacted by the more significant drop in interest rates at December 31, 2015.

The Corporation uses investment securities and derivative instruments as asset and liability management tools with the overall objective of managing the volatility of net interest income from changes in interest rates. These tools assist management in achieving the desired interest rate risk management objectives. Activity related to derivative instruments currently involves interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to floating rate.

The fair value of risk management interest rate swaps was a net unrealized gain of $147 million at December31, 2015 , compared to a net unrealized gain of $175 million at December31, 2014 . Risk management interest rate swaps generated $70 million and $72 million of net interest income for the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
In addition to interest rate swaps, the Corporation employs various other types of derivative instruments as offsetting positions to mitigate exposures to foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or deposits denominated in foreign currencies). Such instruments may include foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swap agreements. The aggregate notional amounts of these risk management derivative instruments at December31, 2015 and 2014 were $593 million and $508 million , respectively.
Further information regarding risk management derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Changes in the fair value of customer-initiated and other derivatives are recognized in earnings as they occur.  To limit the market risk of these activities, the Corporation generally takes offsetting positions with dealers. The notional amounts of offsetting positions are included in the table above. Customer-initiated and other notional activity represented 85 percent and 89 percent of total interest rate, energy and foreign exchange contracts at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Further information regarding customer-initiated and other derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Liquidity Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Liquidity is the ability to meet financial obligations through the maturity or sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds. Various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commercial commitments, may require future cash payments by the Corporation. Certain obligations are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets, while others are off-balance sheet under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The following contractual obligations table summarizes the Corporation's noncancelable contractual obligations and future required minimum payments. Refer to Notes 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these contractual obligations.

In addition to contractual obligations, other commercial commitments of the Corporation impact liquidity. These include commitments to fund indirect private equity and venture capital investments, unused commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial commitments and expected expiration dates by period.

Refer to the Other Market Risks section below and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these commercial commitments.
Wholesale Funding The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at December31, 2015 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $55 million at December31, 2015 , compared to $251 million at December31, 2014 .  At December31, 2015 , the Bank had pledged loans totaling $24 billion which provided for up to $18 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At December31, 2015 , $14.3 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral to provide capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $6 billion . As of December31, 2015 , the Corporation did not have any outstanding borrowings from the FHLB.
Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14.0 billion of debt at December31, 2015 under an existing $15.0 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.
F-37 Table of Contents The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of December31, 2015 , the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
ComericaIncorporated ComericaBank December31, 2015 Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard and Poors (a) A- Negative A Negative Moodys Investors Service (b) A3 Stable A3 Stable Fitch Ratings A Stable A Stable DBRS A Stable A (High) Stable (a) In February 2016, Standard and Poor's downgraded the Corporation's and the Bank's long-term senior credit ratings one notch, from A- to BBB+ for Comerica Incorporated and from A to A- for Comerica Bank, and maintained its "Negative" outlook.
(b) In February 2016, Moody's Investors Service revised its outlook to "Negative." The Corporation satisfies liquidity requirements with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets, which totaled $16.4 billion at December31, 2015 , compared to $13.3 billion at December31, 2014 , provide a reservoir of liquidity.  Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities.
In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of HQLA to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation was in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement.
In the third quarter 2015, the Bank issued $350 million of 4.00% subordinated notes, swapped to floating at 6-month LIBOR plus 1.478%, maturing in 2025 and $175 million of 2.50% senior notes, swapped to floating at 6-month LIBOR plus 0.6348%, maturing in 2020. In the second quarter 2015, the Bank issued $500 million of 2.50% senior debt maturing in 2020 and swapped it to floating at six-month LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The proceeds from these issuances helped position the Corporation for full compliance with LCR, including a buffer for normal volatility in balance sheet dynamics. Any future funding needs for LCR purposes will depend on loan and deposit trends as well as balance sheet strategy. Should the Corporation need to add HQLA to maintain fullcompliance with the LCR rule, a variety of wholesale funding sources are available, as previously discussed.
The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued its final NSFR rule, which was originally introduced in 2010 and revised in January 2014. U.S. banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rules to implement the NSFR in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rule implementing the NSFR and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rule.
The Corporation regularly evaluates its ability to meet funding needs in unanticipated, stressed environments. In conjunction with the quarterly 200 basis point interest rate simulation analyses, discussed in the Interest Rate Sensitivity section of this financial review, liquidity ratios and potential funding availability are examined. Each quarter, the Corporation also evaluates its ability to meet liquidity needs under a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of December31, 2015 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.
Other Market Risks Market risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.
OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The definition includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations. The definition does not include strategic or reputational F-38 Table of Contents risks. Although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management, as outlined in the Corporations risk appetite statement. The appropriate risk level is determined through consideration of the nature of the Corporation's business and the environment in which it operates, in combination with the impact from, and the possible impact on, other risks faced by the Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels. The Operational Risk Management Committee monitors risk management techniques and systems. The Corporation has developed a framework that includes a centralized operational risk management function and business/support unit risk coordinators responsible for managing operational risk specific to the respective business lines.
COMPLIANCE RISK Compliance risk represents the risk of regulatory sanctions or financial loss resulting from the Corporation's failure to comply with regulations and standards of good banking practice. The impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk, as the reputational impact from compliance breaches can be severe. Activities which may expose the Corporation to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending, consumer protection, employment and tax matters, over-the-counter derivative activities and other activities regulated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee, comprising senior and executive business unit managers, as well as managers responsible for compliance, audit and overall risk, oversees compliance risk. This enterprise-wide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization. The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.
STRATEGIC RISK Strategic risk represents the risk of loss due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks accepted, and any other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit, market, operational or compliance risks. Mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through various metrics and initiatives to help the Corporation better understand, measure and report on such risks.
F-39 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 . These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporations future financial condition and results of operations. At December31, 2015 , the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporations Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below.
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments, and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates, including the loss content for internal risk ratings, collateral values, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, and for lending-related commitments, estimates of the probability of draw on unused commitments.
In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Corporation individually evaluates certain impaired loans, applies standard reserve factors to pools of homogeneous loans and lending-related commitments and incorporates qualitative adjustments.  Standard loss factors, applied to the majority of the Corporation's loan portfolio and lending-related commitments, are based on estimates of probabilities of default for individual risk ratings over the loss emergence period and loss given default. Since standard loss factors are applied to large pools of loans, even minor changes in these factors could significantly affect the Corporation's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if recent loss experience dictated that the estimated standard loss factors would be changed by five percent (of the estimate) across all loan risk ratings, the allowance for loan losses as of December31, 2015 would change by approximately $31 million . Loss emergence periods are used to determine the most appropriate default horizon associated with the calculation of probabilities of default. Loss emergence periods tend to lengthen during benign economic periods and shorten during periods of economic distress.  Considered in isolation, lengthening the loss emergence period assumption would result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses.  Because standard loss factors are applied to pools of loans based on the Corporation's internal risk rating system, loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan. The inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the Corporation's asset quality review function and incorporated in a qualitative adjustment. The Corporation may also include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of certain other uncertainties that exist but are not yet reflected in the standard reserve factors.  These qualitative adjustments are based on managements analysis of factors such as portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired, observable macroeconomic metrics, including consideration of regional metrics within the Corporation's footprint, and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Deterioration in metrics and credit trends included in this analysis would result in an increase to the qualitative adjustment increasing the allowance for credit losses.
Since the fourth quarter 2014, the Corporation has incorporated a qualitative reserve component for energy and energy-related loans, primarily for incurred losses that have yet to emerge in the portfolio due to the inherent lag between the date of an energy borrower's most current internal risk rating review, driving the quantitative reserve, and the allowance measurement date. In developing the qualitative adjustment, management considered a range of possible outcomes for probability of default, loss given default and the loss emergence period, as well as historical migration and loss experience under similar economic conditions. For further discussion of energy and energy-related loans, refer to the "Energy Lending" sub-section in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.
For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. A substantial majority of the allowance is assigned to business segments. Any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the Business Bank segment.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These F-40 Table of Contents nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.
Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.  Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements includes information about the fair value hierarchy, the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities and the valuation methodologies and key inputs used.
At December31, 2015 , assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented 97.9 percent and 100.0 percent of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, respectively, and Level 3 assets totaled $244 million , or 2.1 percent of total assets recorded at fair value. Valuations generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3. Unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists often involves significant judgments about assumptions, such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both liquidity and risk premiums, and in many cases may not reflect amounts exchanged in a current sale of the financial instrument. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, the Corporation would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.
GOODWILL Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below.  The Corporation has three reporting units:  the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At December31, 2015 and 2014 , goodwill totaled $635 million , including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management.
The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.
In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation.  Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio that is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation.
Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium.
Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance F-41 Table of Contents of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.
The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2015 . The Corporation's assumptions included modest increases to the Federal funds target rate until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2015 , the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The results of the annual test of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate.
The Corporation performs a goodwill impairment test at least annually, and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired.  During the fourth quarter 2015, the Corporations stock price traded below tangible book value per share, and sustained lower oil and gas prices continued to adversely impact the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans in the Business Bank reporting unit.The Corporation updated its business outlook for 2016 to reflect its assessment of those market conditions and qualitatively considered their impact on the goodwill impairment test. After evaluating the impact of the continued decline of energy prices and changes in market expectations for the upcoming year against the results from the annual impairment test and its sensitivity analysis, the Corporation determined that that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Business Bank continued to be greater than its carrying value, and therefore an interim goodwill impairment test was not performed.
For further information about the Corporation's goodwill accounting policy, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING The Corporation has defined benefit pension plans in effect for substantially all full-time employees hired before January 1, 2007. Benefits under the plans are based on years of service, age and compensation. Assumptions are made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation, the long-term rate of return expected on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and the estimated mortality rate. The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is detailed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets are invested in certain collective investment and mutual funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, and corporate and municipal bonds and notes. The rate of compensation increase is based on reviewing recent annual pension-eligible compensation increases as well as the expectation of future increases. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third-parties such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA), considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources. The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations.
The assumptions used to calculate 2016 expense for the defined benefit pension plans were a discount rate of 4.82 percent , a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.75 percent and a rate of compensation increase of 3.75 percent . The Corporation adopted the RP-2006 mortality tables and the MP-2015 mortality improvement scales issued by the SOA in October 2015, with certain entity-specific adjustments. Defined benefit pension expense in 2016 is expected to decrease approximately 70 percent to about $14 million from the $47 million recorded in 2015 , primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate.
Changing the 2016 key actuarial assumptions discussed above by 25 basis points would have the following impact on defined benefit pension expense in 2016 : 25 Basis Point (in millions) Increase Decrease Key Actuarial Assumption: Discount rate $ (8.8 ) $ 8.8 Long-term rate of return (2.6 ) 2.6 Rate of compensation increase 6.0 (6.0 ) Due to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years. In 2015 , the actual return on plan assets in the qualified defined benefit pension plan was $73 million , compared to an expected return on plan assets of $159 million .
F-42 Table of Contents In 2014 , the actual return on plan assets was $278 million, compared to an expected return on plan assets of $131 million. Total pretax losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December31, 2015 were $607 million for the qualified defined benefit pension plan and $57 million for the non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Actuarial pretax net losses recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December31, 2015 were $77 million for the qualified defined benefit pension plan and $16 million for the non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. For further information, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Defined benefit pension expense is recorded in employee benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income and is allocated to business segments based on the segment's share of salaries expense. Accordingly, defined benefit pension expense was allocated approximately 44 percent , 27 percent , 23 percent and 6 percent to the Retail Bank, Business Bank, Wealth Management and Finance segments, respectively, in 2015 .
INCOME TAXES The calculation of the Corporation's income tax provision and tax-related accruals is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions, currently or in the future, and are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. The Corporation is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation.
Included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets.  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law, interpretations of existing tax laws, new judicial or regulatory guidance, and the status of examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the Corporation. These changes, when they occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes and could be significant to the operating results of the Corporation. For further information on tax accruals and related risks, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

n/a - not applicable.
The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel I risk-based capital rules in effect through December 31, 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, regulatory capital components and risk-weighted assets are defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel III risk-based capital rules. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
F-44 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report includes forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, the Corporation may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements.

F-50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is a registered financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Corporations major business segments are the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and WealthManagement. The Corporation operates in three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. For further discussion of each business segment and primary geographic market, refer to Note 22 .  The Corporation and its banking subsidiaries are regulated at both the state and federal levels.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain items in prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Corporation applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and the accounts of those subsidiaries that are majority owned and in which the Corporation has a controlling financial interest. The Corporation consolidates entities not determined to be variable interest entities (VIEs) when it holds a controlling financial interest in the entity's outstanding voting stock and uses the cost or equity method when it holds less than a controlling financial interest. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The results of operations of companies acquired are included from the date of acquisition.  Certain amounts in the financial statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform to current financial statement presentation.
The Corporation holds investments in certain legal entities that are considered VIEs. In general, a VIE is an entity that either (1)has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2)has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3)has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. If any of these characteristics are present, the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation model, and consolidation is based on variable interests, not on ownership of the entitys outstanding voting stock. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other money interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entitys net asset value. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary is defined as the party that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. The maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding book basis and unfunded commitments for future investments.
The Corporation evaluates its investments in VIEs, both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires reconsideration, to determine if the Corporation is the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required. The Corporation accounts for unconsolidated VIEs using either the proportional, cost or equity method. These investments comprise investments in community development projects which generate tax credits to their investors and are included in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets.
The proportional method is used for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). The equity method is used for other investments where the Corporation has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entitys operation and financial policies, which is generally presumed to exist if the Corporation owns more than a 20 percent voting interest in the entity. Other unconsolidated equity investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the cost method. Amortization and other write-downs of LIHTC investments are presented on a net basis as a component of the "provision for income taxes," while income, amortization and write-downs from cost and equity method investments are recorded in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Corporation and are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
See Note 9 for additional information about the Corporations involvement with VIEs.
F-51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Fair Value Measurements The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, the Corporation uses present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used.
Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.
Trading securities, investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Corporation may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.
Fair value measurements and disclosures guidance establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. Fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, it is the Corporations policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements.
Level1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
The Corporation generally utilizes third-party pricing services to value Level 1 and Level 2 trading and investment securities, as well as certain derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Management reviews the methodologies and assumptions used by the third-party pricing services and evaluates the values provided, principally by comparison with other available market quotes for similar instruments and/or analysis based on internal models using available third-party market data.  The Corporation may occasionally adjust certain values provided by the third-party pricing service when management believes, as the result of its review, that the adjusted price most appropriately reflects the fair value of the particular security.
Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates, often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values.
Following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as well as a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value disclosures for financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis. The descriptions include an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are classified. Transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period, when applicable.
Cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates the estimated fair value.  As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1.
F-52 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Trading securities and associated deferred compensation plan liabilities Trading securities include securities held for trading purposes as well as assets held related to employee deferred compensation plans. Trading securities and associated deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and included in other short-term investments and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. Level 1 trading securities include assets related to employee deferred compensation plans, which are invested in mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and other securities traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Deferred compensation plan liabilities represent the fair value of the obligation to the employee, which corresponds to the fair value of the invested assets. Level 2 trading securities include municipal bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and corporate debt securities. The methods used to value trading securities are the same as the methods used to value investment securities, discussed below.
Investment securities Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Corporation discloses estimated fair values of investment securities held-to-maturity, which is determined in the same manner as investment securities available-for-sale. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored entities and corporate debt securities. The fair value of Level 2 securities is determined using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or pricing models based on observable market data inputs, primarily interest rates, spreads and prepayment information.
Securities classified as Level 3 represent securities in less liquid markets requiring significant management assumptions when determining fair value. Auction-rate securities comprise Level 3 investment securities available-for-sale. The Corporate Development Department, with appropriate oversight and approval provided by senior management, is responsible for determining the valuation methodology for auction-rate securities and for updating significant inputs. Valuation results, including an analysis of changes to the valuation methodology and significant inputs, are provided to senior management for review on a quarterly basis.
Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale, included in other short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets, are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held-for-sale may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. The fair value is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, the Corporation classifies both loans held-for-sale subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments and the estimated fair value of loans held-for sale as Level 2.
Loans The Corporation does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, the Corporation may establish a specific allowance for an impaired loan based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Such loan values are reported as nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Collateral values supporting individually evaluated impaired loans are evaluated quarterly. When management determines that the fair value of the collateral requires additional adjustments, either as a result of non-current appraisal value or when there is no observable market price, the Corporation classifies the impaired loan as Level 3. The Special Assets Group is responsible for performing quarterly credit quality reviews for all impaired loans as part of the quarterly allowance for loan losses process overseen by the Chief Credit Officer, during which valuation adjustments to updated collateral values are determined.
The Corporation discloses fair value estimates for loans.  The estimated fair value is determined based on characteristics such as loan category, repricing features and remaining maturity, and includes prepayment and credit loss estimates. For variable rate business loans that reprice frequently, the estimated fair value is based on carrying values adjusted for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. For other business loans and retail loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model that employs a discount rate that reflects the Corporation's current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable.  The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of loans held for investment as Level 3.
Customers liability on acceptances outstanding and acceptances outstanding Customers' liability on acceptances outstanding is included in "accrued income and other assets" and acceptances outstanding are included in  "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Due to their short-term nature, F-53 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries the carrying amount of these instruments approximates the estimated fair value.  As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1.
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities Derivative instruments held or issued for risk management or customer-initiated activities are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. Fair value for over-the-counter derivative instruments is measured on a recurring basis using internally developed models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities. The Corporation manages credit risk on its derivative positions based on whether the derivatives are being settled through a clearinghouse or bilaterally with each counterparty. For derivative positions settled on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis, the Corporation calculates credit valuation adjustments, included in the fair value of these instruments, on the basis of its relationships at the counterparty portfolio/master netting agreement level. These credit valuation adjustments are determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Corporation, as appropriate, to the total expected exposure of the derivative after considering collateral and other master netting arrangements. These adjustments, which are considered Level 3 inputs, are based on estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. When credit valuation adjustments are significant to the overall fair value of a derivative, the Corporation classifies the over-the-counter derivative valuation in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise, over-the-counter derivative valuations are classified in Level 2.
Warrants which contain a net exercise provision or a non-contingent put right embedded in the warrant agreement are accounted for as derivatives and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using a Black-Scholes valuation model.  The Black-Scholes valuation model utilizes five inputs: risk-free rate, expected life, volatility, exercise price, and the per share market value of the underlying company. The Corporation holds a portfolio of warrants for generally nonmarketable equity securities with a fair value of $2 million at December31, 2015 , included in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. These warrants are primarily from non-public technology companies obtained as part of the loan origination process. The Corporate Development Department is responsible for the warrant valuation process, which includes reviewing all significant inputs for reasonableness, and for providing valuation results to senior management. Increases in any of these inputs in isolation, with the exception of exercise price, would result in a higher fair value.  Increases in exercise price in isolation would result in a lower fair value. The Corporation classifies warrants accounted for as derivatives as Level 3.
Nonmarketable equity securities The Corporation has a portfolio of indirect (through funds) private equity and venture capital investments with a carrying value and unfunded commitments of $10 million and $4 million , respectively, at December31, 2015 . These funds generally cannot be redeemed and the majority is not readily marketable. Distributions from these funds are received by the Corporation as a result of the liquidation of underlying investments of the funds and/or as income distributions. It is estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over a period of up to 12 years. Recently issued federal regulations may require the Corporation to sell certain of these funds prior to liquidation. The investments are accounted for either on the cost or equity method and are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. These investments may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be impaired and written down to fair value. Where there is not a readily determinable fair value, the Corporation estimates fair value for indirect private equity and venture capital investments based on the net asset value, as reported by the fund, after indication that the fund adheres to applicable fair value measurement guidance. On a quarterly basis, the Corporate Development Department is responsible, with appropriate oversight and approval provided by senior management, for performing the valuation procedures and updating significant inputs, as are primarily provided by the underlying fund's management. The Corporation classifies fair value measurements of nonmarketable equity securities as Level 3.
The Corporation also holds restricted equity investments, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock. Restricted equity securities are not readily marketable and are recorded at cost (par value) in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. No significant observable market data for these instruments is available. The Corporation considers the profitability and asset quality of the issuer, dividend payment history and recent redemption experience and believes its investments in FHLB and FRB stock are ultimately recoverable at par. Therefore, the carrying amount for these restricted equity investments approximates fair value. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of such investments as Level 1. The Corporations investment in FHLB stock totaled $7 million at both December31, 2015 and 2014 , and its investment in FRB stock totaled $85 million at both December31, 2015 and 2014 .
Other real estate Other real estate is included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and includes primarily foreclosed property. Foreclosed property is initially recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequently, foreclosed property is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. Other real estate may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. Fair value is based upon F-54 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries independent market prices, appraised value or management's estimate of the value of the property. The Special Assets Group obtains updated independent market prices and appraised values, as  required by state regulation or deemed necessary based on market conditions, and determines if additional write-downs are necessary.  On a quarterly basis, senior management reviews all other real estate and determines whether the carrying values are reasonable, based on the length of time elapsed since receipt of independent market price or appraised value and current market conditions. When management determines that the fair value of other real estate requires additional adjustments, either as a result of a non-current appraisal or when there is no observable market price, the Corporation classifies the other real estate as Level 3.
Deposit liabilities The estimated fair value of checking, savings and certain money market deposit accounts is represented by the amounts payable on demand. The estimated fair value of term deposits is calculated by discounting the scheduled cash flows using the period-end rates offered on these instruments. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of deposit liabilities as Level 2.
Short-term borrowings The carrying amount of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings approximates the estimated fair value. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of short-term borrowings as Level 1.
Medium- and long-term debt The estimated fair value of the Corporation's medium- and long-term debt is based on quoted market values when available. If quoted market values are not available, the estimated fair value is based on the market values of debt with similar characteristics. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of medium- and long-term debt as Level 2.
Credit-related financial instruments Credit-related financial instruments include unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments generate ongoing fees which are recognized over the term of the commitment.  In situations where credit losses are probable, the Corporation records an allowance. The carrying value of these instruments included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, which includes the carrying value of the deferred fees plus the related allowance, approximates the estimated fair value. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of credit-related financial instruments as Level 3.
For further information about fair value measurements refer to Note 2 .
Other Short-Term Investments Other short-term investments include trading securities and loans held-for-sale.
Trading securities are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on trading securities are included in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Loans held-for-sale, typically residential mortgages originated with the intent to sell and occasionally may include other loans transferred to held-for-sale, are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined in the aggregate for each portfolio. Changes in fair value are included in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Investment Securities Securities not held for trading purposes are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Debt securities for which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost. Securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI).
Securities transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity are reclassified at fair value on the date of transfer. The net unrealized gain (loss) at the date of transfer is included in historical cost and amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as a yield adjustment consistent with the amortization of the net unrealized gain (loss) included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the same securities, resulting in no impact to net income.
Investment securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). In determining whether OTTI exists for debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Corporation assesses the likelihood of selling the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Corporation intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the debt security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to fair value, and the full amount of any impairment charge is recorded as a loss in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of income. If the Corporation does not intend to sell the debt security and it is more likely than not that the Corporation F-55 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries will not be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, only the credit component of any impairment of a debt security is recognized as a loss in net securities gains on the consolidated statements of income, with the remaining impairment recorded in OCI.
The OTTI review for equity securities includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment and focuses on the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that securitys performance, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and managements intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value of an equity security that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss in net securities (losses) gains on the consolidated statements of income.
Gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed based on the adjusted cost of the specific security sold.
For further information on investment securities, refer to Note 3 .
Loans Loans and leases originated and held for investment are recorded at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned income, charge-offs and unamortized deferred fees and costs. Interest income is recognized on loans and leases using the interest method.
Loans and leases acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of any existing allowance for loan losses. Acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration at acquisition are reviewed to determine if it is probable that the Corporation will not be able to collect all contractual amounts due, including both principal and interest.  When both conditions exist, such loans are accounted for as purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans. The Corporation generally aggregates PCI loans into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics.
The Corporation estimates the total cash flows expected to be collected from the pools of acquired PCI loans, which include undiscounted expected principal and interest, using credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and payment speeds. The excess of the undiscounted total cash flows expected to be collected over the fair value of the related PCI loans represents the accretable yield, which is recognized as interest income on a level-yield basis over the life of the related loan pools.
For acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition, the difference between the initial fair value and the unpaid principal balance is recognized as interest income on a level-yield basis over the lives of the related loans.
The Corporation assesses all loan modifications to determine whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). A restructuring is considered a TDR when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Corporation grants a concession to the borrower. TDRs on accrual status at the original contractual rate of interest are considered performing.  Nonperforming TDRs include TDRs on nonaccrual status and loans which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans). All TDRs are considered impaired loans.
Loan Origination Fees and Costs Substantially all loan origination fees and costs are deferred and amortized to net interest income over the life of the related loan or over the commitment period as a yield adjustment. Net deferred income on originated loans, including unearned income and unamortized costs, fees, premiums and discounts, totaled $226 million and $267 million at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Loan fees on unused commitments and net origination fees related to loans sold are recognized in noninterest income.
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.
The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans include the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios.  Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.
For further information on the Allowance for Credit Losses, refer to Note 4 .
F-56 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses represents managements assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.
The Corporation individually evaluates certain impaired loans on a quarterly basis and establishes specific allowances for such loans, if required. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that interest or principal payments will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Consistent with this definition, all loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued (nonaccrual loans) are considered impaired. The Corporation individually evaluates nonaccrual loans with book balances of $2 million or more and accruing loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR. The threshold for individual evaluation is revised on an infrequent basis, generally when economic circumstances change significantly. Specific allowances for impaired loans are estimated using one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or discounted expected future cash flows. Collateral values supporting individually evaluated impaired loans are evaluated quarterly. Either appraisals are obtained or appraisal assumptions are updated at least annually unless conditions dictate increased frequency. The Corporation may reduce the collateral value based upon the age of the appraisal and adverse developments in market conditions.
Loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually are evaluated in homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Business loans are assigned to pools based on the Corporation's internal risk rating system. Internal risk ratings are assigned to each business loan at the time of approval and are subjected to subsequent periodic reviews by the Corporations senior management, generally at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a circumstance that affects the credit risk of the loan. For business loans not individually evaluated, losses inherent to the pool are estimated by applying standard reserve factors to outstanding principal balances. Standard reserve factors are based on estimated probabilities of default for each internal risk rating, set to a default horizon based on an estimated loss emergence period, and loss given default. These factors are evaluated quarterly and updated annually, unless economic conditions necessitate a change, giving consideration to count-based borrower risk rating migration experience and trends, recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans, and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts.
The allowance for business loans not individually evaluated also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for (i) risk factors that have not been fully addressed in internal risk ratings, (ii) imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system, (iii) market conditions and (iv) model imprecision. Risk factors that have not been fully addressed in internal risk ratings may include portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired, portfolios where a certain level of concentration introduces added risk, or changes in the level and quality of experience held by lending management. An additional allowance for risk rating errors is calculated based on the results of risk rating accuracy assessments performed on samples of business loans conducted by the Corporation's asset quality review function, a function independent of the lending and credit groups responsible for assigning the initial internal risk rating at the time of approval. Qualitative adjustments for market conditions are determined based on an established framework. The determination of the appropriate adjustment is based on management's analysis of observable macroeconomic metrics, including consideration of regional metrics within the Corporation's footprint, internal credit risk movement and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Management recognizes the sensitivity of various assumptions made in the quantitative modeling of expected losses and may adjust reserves depending upon the level of uncertainty that currently exists in one or more assumption.
In the second quarter 2014, the Corporation enhanced the approach used to determine the standard reserve factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment. The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014. However, because standard reserves are allocated to the segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly.
In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation enhanced the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors by changing from a dollar-based migration method for developing probability of default statistics to a count-based method. Under the dollar-based method, each dollar that moved to default received equal weight in the determination of standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. As a result, the movement of larger loans impacted standard reserve factors more than the movement of smaller loans. By moving to a count-based approach, where each loan that moves to default receives equal weighting, unusually large or small loans will not have a disproportionate influence on the standard reserve factors. The change resulted in a $40 million increase to the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2013.
F-57 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The allowance for retail loans not individually evaluated is determined by applying estimated loss rates to various pools of loans within the portfolios with similar risk characteristics. Estimated loss rates for all pools are updated quarterly, incorporating factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans (using index-based estimates), and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts.
Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate any subsequently required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less any remaining purchase discount.
The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability in countries where the Corporation has loans, could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Significant increases in current portfolio exposures, as well as the inclusion of additional industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for credit losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies.
Loans deemed uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes allowances based on homogeneous pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. A probability of draw estimate is applied to the commitment amount, and the result is multiplied by standard reserve factors consistent with business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain for all letters of credit supporting loans and for letters of credit assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. Other letters of credit and all unfunded commitments have a lower probability of draw. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, with the corresponding charge reflected in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.
Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, reduced-rate loans and foreclosed property.
A loan is considered past due when the contractually required principal or interest payment is not received by the specified due date or, for certain loans, when a scheduled monthly payment is past due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Business loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when management determines full collection of principal or interest is unlikely or when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully collateralized and in the process of collection. The past-due status of a business loan is one of many indicative factors considered in determining the collectibility of the credit. The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged-off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. Residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status once they become 90 days past due and are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due. In addition, junior lien home equity loans less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if they have underlying risk characteristics that place full collection of the loan in doubt, such as when the related senior lien position is identified as seriously delinquent. Residential mortgage and consumer loans in bankruptcy for which the court has discharged the borrower's obligation and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to estimated collateral value, without regard to the actual payment status of the loan, and are classified as TDRs. All other consumer loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due, earlier if deemed uncollectible.
At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Principal and interest payments received on such loans are generally first applied as a reduction of principal. Income on nonaccrual loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received after principal has been fully repaid or future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or when the loan or debt security is both well secured and in the process of collection.
F-58 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries PCI loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition date. Although the PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, the Corporation does not classify these loans as past due or nonperforming as the loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date and the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan.
Foreclosed property (primarily real estate) is initially recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Loans are reclassified to foreclosed property upon obtaining legal title to the collateral. Independent appraisals are obtained to substantiate the fair value of foreclosed property at the time of foreclosure and updated at least annually or upon evidence of deterioration in the propertys value. At the time of foreclosure, the adjustment for the difference between the related loan balance and fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of the property acquired is charged or credited to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent write-downs, operating expenses and losses upon sale, if any, are charged to noninterest expenses. Foreclosed property is included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation, computed on the straight-line method, is charged to operations over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are generally 3 years to 33 years for premises that the Corporation owns and 3 years to 8 years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are generally amortized over the terms of their respective leases or 10 years, whichever is shorter.
Software Capitalized software is stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Capitalized software includes purchased software and capitalizable application development costs associated with internally-developed software. Amortization, computed on the straight-line method, is charged to operations over 5 years, the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalized software is included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles Goodwill, included in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets, is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management.
The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess.
In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill.  To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation.  Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation.
The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.  Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted.  Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, an entity-specific risk premium and a market equity risk premium. Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs F-59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment.
The Corporation may choose to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the first step of the impairment test should be performed in future periods if certain factors indicate that impairment is unlikely. Factors which could be considered in the assessment of the likelihood of impairment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, stock performance of the Corporation and its peers, financial performance, events affecting the Corporation as a whole or its reporting units individually and previous results of goodwill impairment tests.
Core deposit intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis, based on the estimated period the economic benefits are expected to be received. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment for a finite-lived intangible asset exists if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset exceeds its carrying value.
Additional information regarding goodwill and core deposit intangibles can be found in Note 7 .
Nonmarketable Equity Securities The Corporation has certain investments that are not readily marketable. These investments include a portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds and restricted equity investments, which are securities the Corporation is required to hold for various reasons, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock. These investments are accounted for on the cost or equity method and are included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Indirect private equity and venture capital funds are evaluated by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. The amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value that is determined to be other-than-temporary impairment is charged to current earnings and the carrying value of the investment is written down accordingly. FHLB and FRB stock are recorded at cost (par value) and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. If the Corporation does not expect to recover the full par value, the amount by which the par value exceeds the ultimately recoverable value would be charged to current earnings and the carrying value of the investment would be written down accordingly.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments are carried at fair value in either accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument is determined by whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, by the type of hedging relationship. The Corporation presents derivative instruments at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets on a net basis when a right of offset exists, based on transactions with a single counterparty and any cash collateral paid to and/or received from that counterparty for derivative contracts that are subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item (i.e., the ineffective portion), if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change.
For derivatives designated as hedging instruments at inception, the Corporation uses either the short-cut method or applies statistical regression analysis to assess effectiveness. The short-cut method is used for $400 million notional of fair value hedges of medium and long-term debt issued prior to 2006. This method allows for the assumption of zero hedge ineffectiveness and eliminates the requirement to further assess hedge effectiveness on these transactions. For hedge relationships to which the Corporation does not apply the short-cut method, statistical regression analysis is used at inception and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used has been and is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. All components of each derivative instruments gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Net hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Further information on the Corporations derivative instruments and hedging activities is included in Note 8 .
F-60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Short-Term Borrowings Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized borrowings and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash received. The contractual terms of the agreements to repurchase may require the Corporation to provide additional collateral if the fair value of the securities underlying the borrowings declines during the term of the agreement.
Financial Guarantees Certain guarantee contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the Corporation, as guarantor, to make payments to the guaranteed party are initially measured at fair value and included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The subsequent accounting for the liability depends on the nature of the underlying guarantee. The release from risk is accounted for under a particular guarantee when the guarantee expires or is settled, or by a systematic and rational amortization method.
Further information on the Corporations obligations under guarantees is included in Note 8 .
Share-Based Compensation The Corporation recognizes share-based compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for all stock awards, including those with graded vesting. The requisite service period is the period an employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award, which cannot extend beyond the date at which the employee is no longer required to perform any service to receive the share-based compensation (the retirement-eligible date). Certain awards are contingent upon performance and/or market conditions, which affect the number of shares ultimately issued. The Corporation periodically evaluates the probable outcome of the performance conditions and makes cumulative adjustments to compensation expense as appropriate. Market conditions are included in the determination of the fair value of the award on the date of grant.Subsequent to the grant date, market conditions have no impact on the amount of compensation expense the Corporation will recognize over the life of the award.
Further information on the Corporations share-based compensation plans is included in Note 16 .
Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporations revenue recognition policies as they relate to certain noninterest income line items in the consolidated statements of income.
Card fees includes primarily bankcard interchange revenue which is recorded as revenue when earned. Effective January 1,  2015, the Corporation entered into a new contract for an existing debit card program. Guidance provided in Accounting Standards Code 605-45, " Principal Agent Considerations," indicates whether revenue should be reported gross or net for this type of arrangement. Management assessed various principal versus agent indicators provided in the guidance and concluded that the Corporation bears the risks and rewards of providing the services for the card program based on the new contract terms and, therefore, gross presentation of revenues and expenses is appropriate. This change in presentation resulted in increases of $181 million to both "card fees" in noninterest income and "outside processing fee expense" in noninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Service charges on deposit accounts include fees for banking services provided, overdrafts and non-sufficient funds. Revenue is generally recognized in accordance with published deposit account agreements for retail accounts or contractual agreements for commercial accounts.
Fiduciary income includes fees and commissions from asset management, custody, recordkeeping, investment advisory and other services provided to personal and institutional trust customers. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis at the time the services are performed and are based on either the market value of the assets managed or the services provided.
Commercial lending fees primarily include fees assessed on the unused portion of commercial lines of credit ("unused commitment fees") and syndication agent fees. Unused commitment fees are recognized when earned. Syndication agent fees are generally recognized when the transaction is complete.
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Costs Defined benefit pension costs are included in salaries and benefits expense" on the consolidated statements of income and are funded consistent with the requirements of federal laws and regulations. Inherent in the determination of defined benefit pension costs are assumptions concerning future events that will affect the amount and timing of required benefit payments under the plans. These assumptions include demographic assumptions such as retirement age and mortality, a compensation rate increase, a discount rate used to determine the current benefit obligation and a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. Net periodic defined benefit pension expense includes service cost, interest cost based on the assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan F-61 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value of assets, amortization of prior service cost and amortization of net actuarial gains or losses. The market-related value of plan assets is determined by amortizing the current years investment gains and losses (the actual investment return net of the expected investment return) over 5 years. The amortization adjustment cannot exceed 10 percent of the fair value of assets. Prior service costs include the impact of plan amendments on the liabilities and are amortized over the future service periods of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. Actuarial gains and losses result from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value). Amortization of actuarial gains and losses is included as a component of net periodic defined benefit pension cost for a year if the actuarial net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
Postretirement benefits are recognized in salaries and benefits expense" on the consolidated statements of income during the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan or the average remaining future lifetime of retired participants currently receiving benefits under the plan.
See Note 17 for further information regarding the Corporations defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of loss carry-back capacity, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and assumptions made regarding future events. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Corporation classifies interest and penalties on income tax liabilities in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income.
Earnings Per Share Basic net income per common share is calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each share of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (distributed earnings) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Distributed and undistributed earnings are allocated between common and participating security shareholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities (e.g., nonvested restricted stock and service-based restricted stock units). Undistributed net losses are not allocated to nonvested restricted shareholders, as these shareholders do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses incurred by the Corporation. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. The dilutive calculation considers common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of stock options and performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Corporations stock plans and warrants using the treasury stock method, if dilutive. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the total of weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
Statements of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated balance sheets.
Comprehensive Income (Loss) The Corporation presents on an annual basis the components of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate, but consecutive statements and presents on an interim basis the components of net income and a total for comprehensive income in one continuous consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Pending Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (ASU 2014-09), which is intended to improve and converge the financial reporting requirements for revenue contracts with customers. Previous GAAP comprised broad revenue recognition concepts along with numerous industry-specific requirements. The new guidance establishes a five-step model which entities must follow to F-62 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries recognize revenue and removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing guidance.  The guidance under ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and must be retrospectively applied. Entities will have the option of presenting prior periods as impacted by the new guidance or presenting the cumulative effect of initial application along with supplementary disclosures. Early adoption is permitted, but not before annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis," (ASU 2015-02), which makes targeted amendments to the considerations applied by reporting entities when determining if a legal entity should be consolidated, including placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest.  Low-income housing tax credit investments that meet the criteria for the proportional amortization method are not impacted by these amendments. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and must be retrospectively applied. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the ASU will have no impact to the Corporation's financial condition or results of operations.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, "Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)," (ASU 2015-05), which defines specific criteria entities must apply to determine if a cloud computing arrangement includes an in-substance software license. The result of the assessment will direct the entity to apply either software licensing or service contract guidance to record the related costs. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and can be prospectively or retrospectively applied. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the ASU is expected to have an immaterial impact to the Corporation's financial condition or results of operations.
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent), (ASU 2015-07), which amends disclosure requirements for entities that utilize net asset value per share (or its equivalent) to measure fair value as a practical expedient. The update eliminates the requirement to classify these investments within the fair value hierarchy and instead requires disclosure of sufficient information about these investments to permit reconciliation of the fair value of investments categorized within the fair value hierarchy to the investments presented in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-07 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and must be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-07 will impact disclosures, but will have no impact on the Corporation's financial condition or results of operations.
In January, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," (ASU 2016-01), which makes targeted amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure guidance. ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (other than equity method investments) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This change is only applied if a readily determinable fair value can be obtained. The update also requires the use of exit prices to measure fair value for disclosure purposes as well as other enhanced disclosure requirements. The guidance under ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is generally not permitted. At adoption on January 1, 2018, cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on equity investments other than equity method investments will be recognized as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amendments related to equity securities without a readily determinable fair value will be applied prospectively. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-01.
F-63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 2 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, the Corporation uses present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used.
Trading securities, investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Corporation may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.
Refer to Note 1 for further information about the fair value hierarchy, descriptions of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as well as a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value disclosures for financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis.

F-66 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS The Corporation may be required, from time to time, to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include assets that are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, and were recognized at fair value since it was less than cost at the end of the period. The following table presents assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December31, 2015 and 2014 .

For both asset classes, the unobservable inputs were the additional adjustments applied by management to the appraised values to reflect such factors as non-current appraisals and revisions to estimated time to sell. These adjustments are determined based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis and are not quantifiable inputs, although they are used in the determination of fair value.
The following table presents quantitative information related to the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the Corporation's Level 3 recurring fair value measurement as of December31, 2015 and December31, 2014 . The Corporation's Level 3 recurring fair value measurements include auction-rate securities where fair value is determined using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. The inputs in the table below reflect management's expectation of continued illiquidity in the secondary auction-rate securities market due to a lack of market activity for the issuers remaining in the portfolio, a lack of market incentives for issuer redemptions, and the expectation for a continuing low interest rate environment. The December31, 2015 workout periods reflect management's expectation of the pace at which short-term interest rates could rise.

F-67 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS The Corporation typically holds the majority of its financial instruments until maturity and thus does not expect to realize many of the estimated fair value amounts disclosed. The disclosures also do not include estimated fair value amounts for items that are not defined as financial instruments, but which have significant value. These include such items as core deposit intangibles, the future earnings potential of significant customer relationships and the value of trust operations and other fee generating businesses. The Corporation believes the imprecision of an estimate could be significant.

At December31, 2015 , the Corporation had 179 securities in an unrealized loss position with no credit impairment, including 26 U.S. Treasury securities, 124 residential mortgage-backed securities, 16 state and municipal auction-rate securities, one corporate auction-rate debt security and 12 equity and other non-debt auction-rate preferred securities. As of December31, 2015 , approximately 94 percent of the aggregate par value of auction-rate securities have been redeemed or sold since acquisition, of which approximately 91 percent were redeemed at or above cost. The unrealized losses for these securities resulted from changes in market interest rates and liquidity. The Corporation ultimately expects full collection of the carrying amount of these securities, does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of amortized cost. The Corporation does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2015 .
Sales, calls and write-downs of investment securities available-for-sale resulted in the following gains and losses recorded in net securities losses on the consolidated statements of income, computed based on the adjusted cost of the specific security.

(b) Special mention loans are accruing loans that have potential credit weaknesses that deserve managements close attention, such as loans to borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties that may result in deterioration of repayment prospects from the borrower at some future date. This category is generally consistent with the "special mention" category as defined by regulatory authorities.
(c) Substandard loans are accruing loans that have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, such as loans to borrowers who may be experiencing losses from operations or inadequate liquidity of a degree and duration that jeopardizes the orderly repayment of the loan.  Substandard loans also are distinguished by the distinct possibility of loss in the future if these weaknesses are not corrected.  PCI loans are included in the substandard category. This category is generally consistent with the "substandard" category as defined by regulatory authorities.
(d) Nonaccrual loans are loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued. For further information regarding nonaccrual loans, refer to the Nonperforming Assets subheading in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies.

At December31, 2015 and 2014 , commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in TDRs totaled $6 million and $3 million , respectively.
The majority of the modifications considered to be TDRs that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were principal deferrals. The Corporation charges interest on principal balances outstanding during deferral periods.  Additionally, none of the modifications involved forgiveness of principal.  As a result, the current and future financial effects of the recorded balance of loans considered to be TDRs that were restructured during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were insignificant.
On an ongoing basis, the Corporation monitors the performance of modified loans to their restructured terms. In the event of a subsequent default, the allowance for loan losses continues to be reassessed on the basis of an individual evaluation of the loan.

For principal deferrals, incremental deterioration in the credit quality of the loan, represented by a downgrade in the risk rating of the loan, for example, due to missed interest payments or a reduction of collateral value, is considered a subsequent default.

During the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014 , loans with a carrying value of $2 million and $3 million at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were modified by interest rate reduction. For reduced-rate loans , a subsequent payment default is defined in terms of delinquency, when a principal or interest payment is 90 days past due. There were no subsequent payment defaults of reduced rate loans during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
NOTE 5 - SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. Concentrations of both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk are controlled and monitored as part of credit policies. The Corporation is a regional financial services holding company with a geographic concentration of its on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activities in Michigan, California and Texas.
As outlined below, the Corporation has a concentration of credit risk with the automotive industry. Loans to automotive dealers and to borrowers involved with automotive production are reported as automotive, as management believes these loans have similar economic characteristics that might cause them to react similarly to changes in economic conditions. This aggregation involves the exercise of judgment. Included in automotive production are: (a)original equipment manufacturers and Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers that produce components used in vehicles and whose primary revenue source is automotive-related (primary defined as greater than 50%) and (b)other manufacturers that produce components used in vehicles and whose primary revenue source is automotive-related. Loans less than $1 million and loans recorded in the Small Business loan portfolio were excluded from the definition. Outstanding loans, included in "commercial loans" on the consolidated balance sheets, and total exposure from loans, unused commitments and standby letters of credit to companies related to the automotive industry were as follows: F-79 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries (in millions) December31 2015 2014 Automotive loans: Production $ 1,266 $ 1,236 Dealer 6,573 6,431 Total automotive loans $ 7,839 $ 7,667 Total automotive exposure: Production $ 2,452 $ 2,408 Dealer 8,209 7,763 Total automotive exposure $ 10,661 $ 10,171 Further, the Corporations portfolio of commercial real estate loans, which includes real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, was as follows.

In 2015 and 2014 , the annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in 2015 and 2014 the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, indicating that goodwill was not impaired. There have been no events since the annual test performed in the third quarter 2015 that would indicate that it was more likely than not that goodwill had become impaired.

These financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. Market and credit risk are included in the determination of fair value.
Market risk is the potential loss that may result from movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or energy commodity prices that cause an unfavorable change in the value of a financial instrument. The Corporation manages this risk by establishing monetary exposure limits and monitoring compliance with those limits. Market risk inherent in interest rate and energy contracts entered into on behalf of customers is mitigated by taking offsetting positions, except in those circumstances when the amount, tenor and/or contract rate level results in negligible economic risk, whereby the cost of purchasing an offsetting contract is not economically justifiable. The Corporation mitigates most of the inherent market risk in foreign exchange contracts entered into on behalf of customers by taking offsetting positions and manages the remainder through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and reviewed quarterly. Market risk inherent in derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes is typically offset by changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
Credit risk is the possible loss that may occur in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to a financial instrument. The Corporation attempts to minimize credit risk arising from customer-initiated derivatives by evaluating the creditworthiness of each customer, adhering to the same credit approval process used for traditional lending activities and obtaining collateral as F-81 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries deemed necessary. Derivatives with dealer counterparties are either cleared through a clearinghouse or settled directly with a single counterparty. For derivatives settled directly with dealer counterparties, the Corporation utilizes counterparty risk limits and monitoring procedures as well as master netting arrangements and bilateral collateral agreements to facilitate the management of credit risk. Master netting arrangements effectively reduce credit risk by permitting settlement of positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. Bilateral collateral agreements require daily exchange of cash or highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government entities to collateralize amounts due to either party beyond certain risk limits. At December31, 2015 , counterparties with bilateral collateral agreements had pledged $139 million of marketable investment securities and deposited $354 million of cash with the Corporation to secure the fair value of contracts in an unrealized gain position, and the Corporation had pledged $3 million of investment securities and posted $3 million of cash as collateral for contracts in an unrealized loss position. For those counterparties not covered under bilateral collateral agreements, collateral is obtained, if deemed necessary, based on the results of managements credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral varies, but may include cash, investment securities, accounts receivable, equipment or real estate. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk. These adjustments are determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Corporation, as appropriate, to the total expected exposure of the derivative.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December31, 2015 was $2 million , for which the Corporation had pledged collateral of $1 million in the normal course of business. The credit-risk-related contingent features require the Corporations debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. If the Corporations debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could require additional overnight collateral on derivative instruments in net liability positions. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December31, 2015 , the Corporation would have been required to assign an additional $1 million of collateral to its counterparties.
Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments utilized by the Corporation are negotiated over-the-counter and primarily include swaps, caps and floors, forward contracts and options, each of which may relate to interest rates, energy commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates. Swaps are agreements in which two parties periodically exchange cash payments based on specified indices applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Caps and floors are agreements which entitle the buyer to receive cash payments based on the difference between a specified reference rate or price and an agreed strike rate or price, applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Forward contracts are over-the-counter agreements to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date and price. Options are similar to forward contracts except the purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the asset during a specified period or at a specified future date.
Over-the-counter contracts are tailored to meet the needs of the counterparties involved and, therefore, contain a greater degree of credit risk and liquidity risk than exchange-traded contracts, which have standardized terms and readily available price information. The Corporation reduces exposure to market and liquidity risks from over-the-counter derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes, and transactions entered into to mitigate the market risk associated with customer-initiated transactions, by conducting hedging transactions with investment grade domestic and foreign financial institutions and subjecting counterparties to credit approvals, limits and collateral monitoring procedures similar to those used in making other extensions of credit. In addition, certain derivative contracts executed bilaterally with a dealer counterparty in the over-the-counter market are cleared through a clearinghouse, whereby the clearinghouse becomes the counterparty to the transaction.
F-82 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The following table presents the composition of the Corporations derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes or in connection with customer-initiated and other activities at December31, 2015 and 2014 .

These amounts are typically not exchanged, significantly exceed amounts subject to credit or market risk and are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets.
(b) Net derivative assets are included in accrued income and other assets and net derivative liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Included in the fair value of net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk and credit risk of the Corporation. The fair value of net derivative assets included credit valuation adjustments for counterparty credit risk of $5 million at December31, 2015 and $2 million at December31, 2014 .
Risk Management As an end-user, the Corporation employs a variety of financial instruments for risk management purposes, including cash instruments, such as investment securities, as well as derivative instruments. Activity related to these instruments is centered predominantly in the interest rate markets and mainly involves interest rate swaps. Various other types of instruments also may F-83 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries be used to manage exposures to market risks, including interest rate caps and floors, total return swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swap agreements.
The Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements related to medium- and long-term debt for interest rate risk management purposes. These interest rate swap agreements effectively modify the Corporations exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed-rate debt to a floating rate. These agreements involve the receipt of fixed-rate interest amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments over the life of the agreement, without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. Risk management fair value interest rate swaps generated net interest income of $70 million and $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Corporation recognized $1 million of gain for the year ended December31, 2015 and an insignificant amount of gain for the year ended December31, 2014 in "other noninterest income" in the consolidated statements of income for the ineffective portion of risk management derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt.
Foreign exchange rate risk arises from changes in the value of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Corporation employs spot and forward contracts in addition to swap contracts to manage exposure to these and other risks. The Corporation recognized an insignificant amount of net losses for each of the years ended December31, 2015 and December31, 2014 on risk management derivative instruments used as economic hedges in "other noninterest income" in the consolidated statements of income.
The following table summarizes the expected weighted average remaining maturity of the notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps and the weighted average interest rates associated with amounts expected to be received or paid on interest rate swap agreements as of December31, 2015 and 2014 .
Weighted Average (dollar amounts in millions) Notional Amount Remaining Maturity (inyears) ReceiveRate PayRate(a) December31, 2015 Swaps - fair value - receive fixed/pay floating rate Medium- and long-term debt designation $ 2,525 5.1 3.89 % 1.11 % December31, 2014 Swaps - fair value - receive fixed/pay floating rate Medium- and long-term debt designation 1,800 4.6 4.54 0.49 (a) Variable rates paid on receive fixed swaps are based on six-month LIBOR rates in effect at December31, 2015 and 2014 .
Management believes these hedging strategies achieve the desired relationship between the rate maturities of assets and funding sources which, in turn, reduce the overall exposure of net interest income to interest rate risk, although there can be no assurance that such strategies will be successful.
Customer-Initiated and Other The Corporation enters into derivative transactions at the request of customers and generally takes offsetting positions with dealer counterparties to mitigate the inherent market risk. Income primarily results from the spread between the customer derivative and the offsetting dealer position.
For customer-initiated foreign exchange contracts where offsetting positions have not been taken, the Corporation manages the remaining inherent market risk through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and reviewed quarterly. For those customer-initiated derivative contracts which were not offset or where the Corporation holds a speculative position within the limits described above, the Corporation recognized $1 million of net gains in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
F-84 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Fair values of customer-initiated and other derivative instruments represent the net unrealized gains or losses on such contracts and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The net gains recognized in income on customer-initiated derivative instruments, net of the impact of offsetting positions, were as follows.
(in millions) Years Ended December 31 Location of Gain 2015 2014 Interest rate contracts Other noninterest income $ 16 $ 20 Energy contracts Other noninterest income 2 2 Foreign exchange contracts Foreign exchange income 37 38 Total $ 55 $ 60 Credit-Related Financial Instruments The Corporation issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with commercial and consumer lending activities. The Corporations credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table.
(in millions) December 31 2015 2014 Unused commitments to extend credit: Commercial and other $ 26,115 $ 27,905 Bankcard, revolving check credit and home equity loan commitments 2,414 2,151 Total unused commitments to extend credit $ 28,529 $ 30,056 Standby letters of credit $ 3,985 $ 3,880 Commercial letters of credit 41 75 The Corporation maintains an allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. At December31, 2015 and 2014 , the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, was $45 million and $41 million , respectively.
Unused Commitments to Extend Credit Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total contractual amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Corporation. Commercial and other unused commitments are primarily variable rate commitments. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments included $33 million and $30 million at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, for probable credit losses inherent in the Corporations unused commitments to extend credit.
Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit Standby letters of credit represent conditional obligations of the Corporation which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. Commercial letters of credit are issued to finance foreign or domestic trade transactions. These contracts expire in decreasing amounts through the year 2022 . The Corporation may enter into participation arrangements with third parties that effectively reduce the maximum amount of future payments which may be required under standby and commercial letters of credit. These risk participations covered $287 million and $316 million at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, of the $4.0 billion of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at both December31, 2015 and 2014 .
The carrying value of the Corporations standby and commercial letters of credit, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $49 million at December31, 2015 , including $37 million in deferred fees and $12 million in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. At December31, 2014 , the comparable amounts were $55 million , $44 million and $11 million , respectively.
The following table presents a summary of criticized standby and commercial letters of credit at December31, 2015 and December31, 2014 . The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting, periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using Board committee approved credit policies and guidelines.
F-85 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries (dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2015 December31, 2014 Total criticized standby and commercial letters of credit $ 110 $ 79 As a percentage of total outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit 2.7 % 2.0 % Other Credit-Related Financial Instruments The Corporation enters into credit risk participation agreements, under which the Corporation assumes credit exposure associated with a borrowers performance related to certain interest rate derivative contracts. The Corporation is not a party to the interest rate derivative contracts and only enters into these credit risk participation agreements in instances in which the Corporation is also a party to the related loan participation agreement for such borrowers. The Corporation manages its credit risk on the credit risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the normal credit review process had it entered into the derivative instruments directly with the borrower. The notional amount of such credit risk participation agreement reflects the pro-rata share of the derivative instrument, consistent with its share of the related participated loan. As of December31, 2015 and 2014 , the total notional amount of the credit risk participation agreements was approximately $559 million and $598 million , respectively, and the fair value, included in customer-initiated interest rate contracts recorded in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, was insignificant for each period. The maximum estimated exposure to these agreements, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments, assuming 100 percent default by all obligors on the maximum values, was approximately $5 million and $7 million at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In the event of default, the lead bank has the ability to liquidate the assets of the borrower, in which case the lead bank would be required to return a percentage of the recouped assets to the participating banks. As of December31, 2015 , the weighted average remaining maturity of outstanding credit risk participation agreements was 2.4 years.
NOTE 9 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIEs) The Corporation evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Corporation is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration.
The Corporation holds ownership interests in funds in the form of limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs) investing in affordable housing projects that qualify for the LIHTC. The Corporation also directly invests in limited partnerships and LLCs which invest in community development projects which generate similar tax credits to investors. As an investor, the Corporation obtains income tax credits and deductions from the operating losses of these tax credit entities. These tax credit entities meet the definition of a VIE; however, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of the entities, as the general partner or the managing member has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities. While the partnership/LLC agreements allow the limited partners/investor members, through a majority vote, to remove the general partner/managing member, this right is not deemed to be substantive as the general partner/managing member can only be removed for cause.
The Corporation accounts for its interests in LIHTC entities using the proportional amortization method. Exposure to loss as a result of the Corporations involvement with LIHTC entities at December31, 2015 was limited to approximately $405 million . Ownership interests in other community development projects which generate similar tax credits to investors (other tax credit entities) are accounted for under either the cost or equity method. Exposure to loss as a result of the Corporation's involvement in other tax credit entities at December31, 2015 was limited to approximately $10 million .
Investment balances, including all legally binding commitments to fund future investments, are included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. A liability is recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for all legally binding unfunded commitments to fund tax credit entities ( $143 million at December31, 2015 ). Amortization and other write-downs of LIHTC investments are presented on a net basis as a component of the "provision for income taxes" on the consolidated statements of income, while amortization and write-downs of other tax credit investments are recorded in other noninterest income." The income tax credits and deductions are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and a reduction of federal income taxes payable.
The Corporation provided no financial or other support that was not contractually required to any of the above VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
The following table summarizes the impact of these tax credit entities on line items on the Corporations consolidated statements of income.

All foreign office time deposits of $32 million and $135 million at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were in denominations of $250,000 or more.
NOTE 11 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Other short-term borrowings, which may consist of borrowed securities and short-term notes, generally mature within one to 120 days from the transaction date.
At December31, 2015 , Comerica Bank (the Bank), a subsidiary of the Corporation, had pledged loans totaling $24 billion which provided for up to $18 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.

F-88 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries In 2015, the Corporation early adopted accounting guidance that amended the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as a deferred charge. The new guidance was retrospectively applied, which resulted in a decrease of $4 million to both "accrued income and other assets" and "medium- and long-term debt" on the consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2014. At December31, 2015 , unamortized debt issuance costs deducted from the carrying amount of medium- and long-term debt totaled $8 million .
The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real-estate related assets.  Actual borrowing capacity is contingent upon the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB.  At December31, 2015 , $14 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for potential future borrowings of approximately $6 billion .
At December31, 2015 , the principal maturities of medium- and long-term debt were as follows: (in millions) Years Ending December 31 2016 $ 650 2017 500 2018 2 2019 357 2020 682 Thereafter 750 Total $ 2,941 NOTE 13 - SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY The Federal Reserve completed its 2015 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) of the Corporation's 2015-2016 capital plan in March 2015 and did not object to the capital distributions contemplated in the plan. The capital plan provides for up to $393 million of equity repurchases for the five-quarter period ending June 30, 2016. During the year ended December31, 2015 , the Corporation had repurchased $242 million under the equity repurchase program.
Repurchases of common stock under the equity repurchase program authorized in 2010 by the Board of Directors of the Corporation totaled 5.1 million shares at an average price paid of $45.65 per share in 2015 , 5.2 million shares at an average price paid of $47.91 per share in 2014 and 7.4 million shares at an average price paid of $38.63 per share in 2013 . The Corporation also repurchased 500 thousand warrants at an average price paid of $20.70 in 2015 . There is no expiration date for the Corporation's equity repurchase program.
At December31, 2015 , the Corporation had 9.5 million warrants outstanding to purchase 8.5 million common shares at a weighted-average exercise price of $29.43 . Outstanding warrants were exercisable at the date of grant and expire in 2018 . Approximately 934 thousand and 361 thousand shares of common stock were issued upon exercise of warrants in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. There were no warrant exercises in 2013 .
At December31, 2015 , the Corporation had 8.5 million shares of common stock reserved for warrant exercises, 12.7 million shares of common stock reserved for stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting and 1.9 million shares of restricted stock outstanding to employees and directors under share-based compensation plans.

Restricted stock vests over periods ranging from three years to five years, restricted stock units vest over periods ranging from one year to three years, and stock options vest over periods ranging from one year to four years. The maturity of each option is determined at the date of grant; however, no options may be exercised later than ten years from the date of grant. The options may have restrictions regarding exercisability. The plans originally provided for a grant of up to 19.4 million common shares, plus shares under certain plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled, which become available for re-grant. At December31, 2015 , 9.8 million shares were available for grant.
F-91 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The Corporation used a binomial model to value stock options granted in the periods presented. Option valuation models require several inputs, including the expected stock price volatility, and changes in input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. The model used may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee and director stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption used in the binomial option-pricing model as outlined in the table below was based on the federal ten-year treasury interest rate. The expected dividend yield was based on the historical and projected dividend yield patterns of the Corporations common shares. Expected volatility assumptions considered both the historical volatility of the Corporations common stock over a ten-year period and implied volatility based on actively traded options on the Corporations common stock with pricing terms and trade dates similar to the stock options granted.
The estimated weighted-average grant-date fair value per option and the underlying binomial option-pricing model assumptions are summarized in the following table: Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Weighted-average grant-date fair value per option $ 11.31 $ 13.21 $ 9.07 Weighted-average assumptions: Risk-free interest rates 1.83 % 2.95 % 1.94 % Expected dividend yield 3.00 3.00 3.00 Expected volatility factors of the market price of Comerica common stock 33 31 34 Expected option life (in years) 6.9 5.8 6.4 A summary of the Corporations stock option activity and related information for the year ended December31, 2015 follows: Weighted-Average Number of Options (inthousands) ExercisePrice perShare Remaining Contractual Term (inyears) Aggregate IntrinsicValue (inmillions) Outstanding-January 1, 2015 14,003 $ 44.28 Granted 1,035 42.32 Forfeited or expired (2,405 ) 53.88 Exercised (841 ) 33.46 Outstanding-December 31, 2015 11,792 42.92 4.1 $ 53 Outstanding, net of expected forfeitures-December 31, 2014 11,520 43.04 4.0 52 Exercisable-December 31, 2015 9,146 43.70 3.0 43 The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options shown in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value at December31, 2015 , based on the Corporations closing stock price of $41.83 at December31, 2015 .

The Corporations postretirement benefit plan continues to provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for retirees as of December31, 1992. The plan also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a limited number of retirees who retired prior to January1, 2000. For all other employees hired prior to January1, 2000, a nominal benefit is provided. Employees hired on or after January1, 2000 and prior to January 1, 2007 are eligible to participate in the plan on a full contributory basis until Medicare-eligible. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the plan. The Corporation funds the pre-1992 retiree plan benefits with bank-owned life insurance. Employee benefits expense included postretirement benefit expense of $1 million in each of the years ended December31, 2015 and December31, 2014 , and $2 million in the year ended December31, 2013 .

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The returns on the various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term rate of return. The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations.

Derivative instruments are permissible for hedging and transactional efficiency, but only to the extent that the derivative use enhances the efficient execution of the plans investment policy. The plan does not directly invest in securities issued by the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Corporations target allocations for plan investments are 36 percent to 56 percent equity securities and 44 percent to 64 percent fixed income, including cash. Equity securities include collective investment and mutual funds and common stock. Fixed income securities include U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and notes, municipal bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and money market funds.
Fair Value Measurements The Corporations qualified defined benefit pension plan utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments and to determine fair value disclosures. The Corporations qualified benefit pension plan categorizes investments recorded at fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the markets in which the investment are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. Refer to Note 1 for a description of the three-level hierarchy.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure the fair value of the Corporations qualified defined benefit pension plan investments, including an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the investments are classified.
Collective investment funds Fair value measurement is based upon the net asset value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. Collective investment fund NAVs are based primarily on observable inputs, generally the quoted prices for underlying assets owned by the fund, and are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Mutual funds Fair value measurement is based upon the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. Mutual fund NAVs are quoted in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, and are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Common stock Fair value measurement is based upon the closing price quoted in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 common stock includes domestic and foreign stock and real estate investment trusts.
U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets.
F-96 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Corporate and municipal bonds and notes Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or pricing models based on observable market data inputs, primarily interest rates, spreads and prepayment information. Level 2 securities include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, foreign bonds and foreign notes.
Collateralized mortgage obligations, U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and TBA mortgage-backed securities Fair value measurement is based upon independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors, such as credit loss and liquidity assumptions, and are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Private placements Fair value is measured using the NAV provided by fund management as quoted prices in active markets are not available. Management considers additional discounts to the provided NAV for market and credit risk. Private placements are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Values The fair values of the Corporations qualified defined benefit pension plan investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December31, 2015 and 2014 , by asset category and level within the fair value hierarchy, are detailed in the table below.

Defined Contribution Plans Substantially all of the Corporations employees are eligible to participate in the Corporations principal defined contribution plan (a 401(k) plan). Under this plan, the Corporation makes core matching cash contributions of 100 percent of the first 4 percent of qualified earnings contributed by employees (up to the current IRS compensation limit), invested based on employee investment elections. Employee benefits expense included expense for the plan of $22 million for each of the years ended December31, 2015 and December31, 2014 , and $21 million for the year ended December31, 2013 .
The Corporation also provides a profit sharing plan for the benefit of substantially all employees  who work at least 1,000 hours in a plan year and are not accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plan. Under the profit sharing plan, the Corporation makes an annual discretionary allocation to the individual account of each eligible employee ranging from 3 percent to 8 percent of annual compensation, determined based on combined age and years of service. The allocations are invested based on employee investment elections. The employee fully vests in the defined contribution pension plan after three years of service, at age 65 if still employed, or in the event of death while an employee. Before an employee is eligible to participate, the plan requires the equivalent of one year of service. The Corporation recognized $10 million in employee benefits expense for this plan for each of the years ended December31, 2015 and December31, 2014 , and $7 million for the year ended December31, 2013 .
Deferred Compensation Plans The Corporation offers optional deferred compensation plans under which certain employees may make an irrevocable election to defer incentive compensation and/or a portion of base salary until retirement or separation from the Corporation. The employee may direct deferred compensation into one or more deemed investment options. Although not required to do so, the Corporation invests actual funds into the deemed investments as directed by employees, resulting in a deferred compensation asset, recorded in other short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets that offsets the liability to employees under the plan, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The earnings from the deferred compensation asset are recorded in interest on short-term investments and other noninterest income and the related change in the liability to employees under the plan is recorded in salaries expense on the consolidated statements of income.
F-98 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 18 - INCOME TAXES AND TAX-RELATED ITEMS The provision for income taxes is calculated as the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Income taxes due for the current year is computed by applying federal and state tax statutes to current year taxable income. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Tax-related interest and penalties and foreign taxes are then added to the tax provision.
The current and deferred components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (in millions) December 31 2015 2014 2013 Current: Federal $ 275 $ 127 $ 242 Foreign 5 6 6 State and local 20 14 17 Total current 300 147 265 Deferred: Federal (68 ) 123 (20 ) State and local (3 ) 7  Total deferred (71 ) 130 (20 ) Total $ 229 $ 277 $ 245 Income before income taxes of $750 million for the year ended December31, 2015 included $34 million of foreign-source income.
The income tax provision on securities transactions for the year ended December31, 2015 was a benefit of $1 million and there was no tax provision on securities transactions for the years ended December31, 2014 and December31, 2013 .
The provision for income taxes does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available-for-sale or the change in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The income tax effects of transactions under the Corporation's share-based compensation plans reduced both shareholders equity and deferred tax assets by $12 million , $11 million and $5 million in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 respectively.
A reconciliation of expected income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the Corporations provision for income taxes and effective tax rate follows: (dollar amounts in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Years Ended December 31 Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate Tax based on federal statutory rate $ 262 35.0 % $ 305 35.0 % $ 275 35.0 % State income taxes 10 1.3 13 1.5 11 1.4 Affordable housing and historic credits (22 ) (2.9 ) (24 ) (2.8 ) (21 ) (2.6 ) Bank-owned life insurance (15 ) (2.0 ) (15 ) (1.7 ) (15 ) (1.9 ) Other changes in unrecognized tax benefits   2 0.2 (2 ) (0.2 ) Lease termination transactions (5 ) (0.7 )     Tax-related interest and penalties 1 0.1 (3 ) (0.3 ) (1 ) (0.1 ) Other (2 ) (0.3 ) (1 ) (0.1 ) (2 ) (0.4 ) Provision for income taxes $ 229 30.5 % $ 277 31.8 % $ 245 31.2 % The liability for tax-related interest and penalties included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was $3 million and $2 million at December31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into certain transactions that have tax consequences. From time to time, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may review and/or challenge specific interpretive tax positions taken by the Corporation with respect to those transactions. The Corporation believes that its tax returns were filed based upon applicable statutes, regulations and case law in effect at the time of the transactions. The IRS, an administrative authority or a court, if presented with the transactions, could disagree with the Corporations interpretation of the tax law.
F-99 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of net unrecognized tax benefits follows: (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Balance at January 1 $ 14 $ 11 $ 42 Increases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period 8 3  Decrease related to settlements with tax authorities   (31 ) Balance at December 31 $ 22 $ 14 $ 11 The Corporation anticipates that it is reasonably possible that settlements with tax authorities will result in an $8 million decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
After consideration of the effect of the federal tax benefit available on unrecognized state tax benefits, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Corporations effective tax rate was approximately $4 million at December31, 2015 and $2 million at December31, 2014 .
The following tax years for significant jurisdictions remain subject to examination as of December31, 2015 : Jurisdiction Tax Years Federal 2010-2014 California 2003-2014 Based on current knowledge and probability assessment of various potential outcomes, the Corporation believes that current tax reserves are adequate, and the amount of any potential incremental liability arising is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary.
The principal components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (in millions) December 31 2015 2014 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 223 $ 208 Deferred compensation 113 123 Loan purchase accounting adjustments 2 5 Deferred loan origination fees and costs 24 28 Other temporary differences, net 67 44 Total deferred tax asset before valuation allowance 429 408 Valuation allowance (3 )  Total deferred tax assets 426 408 Deferred tax liabilities: Lease financing transactions (183 ) (206 ) Defined benefit plans (32 ) (38 ) Net unrealized gains on investment securities available-for-sale (5 ) (21 ) Allowance for depreciation (7 ) (13 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (227 ) (278 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 199 $ 130 Included in deferred tax assets at December31, 2015 were $5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between 2016 and 2026 . The Corporation believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain of these state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized and, accordingly, established a valuation allowance of $3 million at December31, 2015 . There was no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December31, 2014 . The determination regarding valuation allowances was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events. For further information on the Corporations valuation policy for deferred tax assets, refer to Note 1 .
F-100 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 19 - TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES The Corporations banking subsidiaries had, and expect to have in the future, transactions with the Corporations directors and executive officers, companies with which these individuals are associated, and certain related individuals. Such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business and included extensions of credit, leases and professional services. With respect to extensions of credit, all were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with other customers and did not, in managements opinion, involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. The aggregate amount of loans attributable to persons who were related parties at December31, 2015 , totaled $79 million at the beginning of 2015 and $121 million at the end of 2015 . During 2015 , new loans to related parties aggregated $453 million and repayments totaled $411 million .
NOTE 20 - REGULATORY CAPITAL AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS Reserves required to be maintained and/or deposited with the FRB are classified in interest-bearing deposits with banks. These reserve balances vary, depending on the level of customer deposits in the Corporations banking subsidiaries. The average required reserve balances were $473 million and $430 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Banking regulations limit the transfer of assets in the form of dividends, loans or advances from the bank subsidiaries to the parent company. Under the most restrictive of these regulations, the aggregate amount of dividends which can be paid to the parent company, with prior approval from bank regulatory agencies, approximated $398 million at January1, 2016 , plus 2016 net profits. Substantially all the assets of the Corporations banking subsidiaries are restricted from transfer to the parent company of the Corporation in the form of loans or advances.
The Corporations subsidiary banks declared dividends of $437 million , $380 million and $480 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
The Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. The U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (Basel III) became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015; December 31, 2014 data is based on Basel I rules. Basel III sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), a standardized approach and an advanced approach. The Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to the standardized approach under the rules. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class.  Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors.
Under Basel III, there are three categories of risk-based capital: CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders' equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses.  Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital (as defined in the regulations) to average and/or risk-weighted assets. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporations financial statements. At December31, 2015 and 2014 , the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered well capitalized For U.S. banking subsidiaries, those requirements were total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, CET1 risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than 10 percent , 8 percent , 6.5 percent and 5 percent , respectively, at December31, 2015 ; and total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than 10 percent , 6 percent and 5 percent , respectively, at December31, 2014 . For the Corporation, requirements to be considered "well capitalized" were total risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios greater than 10 percent and 6 percent , respectively, at December31, 2015 and 2014 . There have been no conditions or events since December31, 2015 that management believes have changed the capital adequacy classification of the Corporation or its U.S. banking subsidiaries.

Masters Group v. Comerica Bank (the case), for lender liability.  The case was tried in January 2014, in the Montana Second District Judicial Court for Silver Bow County in Butte, Montana ("the court"). On January17, 2014 , a jury awarded Masters $52 million against the Bank. On July 1, 2015, after an appeal filed by the Corporation, the Montana Supreme court ("the court") reversed the judgment against the Corporation and remanded the case for a new trial with instructions that Michigan law should apply.  The court also reversed punitive and consequential damages previously awarded by the jury.  The Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the remaining claims in this case and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously.  Management believes that current reserves related to this case are adequate in the event of a negative outcome.
The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various other pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations. The Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its other currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with respect to such legal proceedings, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to managements judgment as to what is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders.  Settlement may result from the Corporation's determination that it may be more prudent financially to settle, rather than litigate, and should not be regarded as an admission of liability. On at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation assesses its potential liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. On a case-by-case basis, reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred either as a result of a settlement or judgment, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. Based on current knowledge, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that current reserves are adequate, and the amount of any incremental liability arising from these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows.  Legal fees of $21million for the year ended December31, 2015 , and $24 million for each of the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , were included in "other noninterest expenses" on the consolidated statements of income.
For matters where a loss is not probable, the Corporation has not established legal reserves. The Corporation believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for all legal proceedings in which it is involved is from zero to approximately $33 million at December31, 2015 . This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Corporation is involved, taking into account the Corporations best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Corporation does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Corporations estimate involves significant judgment, F-102 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in certain proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Corporation) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Corporations estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate.
In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Corporation's consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows.
For information regarding income tax contingencies, refer to Note 18 .
NOTE 22 - BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and WealthManagement. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. Business segment results are produced by the Corporations internal management accounting system. This system measures financial results based on the internal business unit structure of the Corporation. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each business segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. From time to time, the Corporation may make reclassifications among the segments to more appropriately reflect management's current view of the segments, and methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on business unit structure and methodologies in effect at December31, 2015 .
Net interest income for each business segment is the total of interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits and charges.The FTP methodology provides the business segments credits for deposits and other funds provided and charges the business segments for loans and other assets utilizing funds.This credit or charge is based on matching stated or implied maturities for these assets and liabilities. The FTP credit provided for deposits reflects the long-term value of deposits generated based on their implied maturity. The FTP charge for funding assets reflects a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and term characteristics of the assets. For acquired loans and deposits, matched maturity funding is determined based on origination date.Accordingly, the FTP process reflects the transfer of interest rate risk exposures to the Treasury group within the Finance segment, where such exposures are centrally managed. The allowance for loan losses is allocated to the business segments based on the methodology used to estimate the consolidated allowance for loan losses described in Note 1. The related provision for loan losses is assigned based on the amount necessary to maintain an allowance for loan losses appropriate for each business segment. Noninterest income and expenses directly attributable to a line of business are assigned to that business segment. Direct expenses incurred by areas whose services support the overall Corporation are allocated to the business segments as follows: product processing expenditures are allocated based on standard unit costs applied to actual volume measurements; administrative expenses are allocated based on estimated time expended; and corporate overhead is assigned 50 percent based on the ratio of the business segments noninterest expenses to total noninterest expenses incurred by all business segments and 50 percent based on the ratio of the business segments attributed equity to total attributed equity of all business segments. Equity is attributed based on credit, operational and interest rate risks. Most of the equity attributed relates to credit risk, which is determined based on the credit score and expected remaining life of each loan, letter of credit and unused commitment recorded in the business segments. Operational risk is allocated based on loans and letters of credit, deposit balances, non-earning assets, trust assets under management, certain noninterest income items, and the nature and extent of expenses incurred by business units. Virtually all interest rate risk is assigned to Finance, as are the Corporations hedging activities.
In 2014, the Corporation enhanced the approach used to determine the standard reserve factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment.  The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014.  However, because standard reserves are allocated to the segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly.  As a result, the 2014 provision for credit losses within each segment is not comparable to 2013 amounts.
F-103 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Effective January 1, 2015, changes to the terms of card program contract resulted in a change to the presentation of the related revenue and expenses. In 2015, under the current contract, total revenue before related expenses was recorded in noninterest income, and related expenses were recorded in noninterest expense; whereas in 2014, under the terms of the prior contract, revenue was recorded in noninterest income net of the related expenses. The effect of this change was an increase of $181 million to both noninterest income and noninterest expenses in the Business Bank and Other Markets in 2015 .
The following discussion provides information about the activities of each business segment. A discussion of the financial results and the factors impacting 2015 performance can be found in the section entitled "Business Segments" in the financial review.
The Business Bank meets the needs of middle market businesses, multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services, including commercial loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services and loan syndication services.
The Retail Bank includes small business banking and personal financial services, consisting of consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering and mortgage loan origination. In addition to a full range of financial services provided to small business customers, this business segment offers a variety of consumer products, including deposit accounts, installment loans, credit cards, student loans, home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage loans.
WealthManagement offers products and services consisting of fiduciary services, private banking, retirement services, investment management and advisory services, investment banking and brokerage services. This business segment also offers the sale of annuity products, as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance products.
The Finance segment includes the Corporations securities portfolio and asset and liability management activities. This segment is responsible for managing the Corporations funding, liquidity and capital needs, performing interest sensitivity analysis and executing various strategies to manage the Corporations exposure to liquidity, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Other category includes the income and expense impact of equity and cash, tax benefits not assigned to specific business segments, charges of an unusual or infrequent nature that are not reflective of the normal operations of the business segments and miscellaneous other expenses of a corporate nature.

F-110 Table of Contents REPORT OF MANAGEMENT The management of Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is responsible for the accompanying consolidated financial statements and all other financial information in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts which of necessity are based on managements best estimates and judgments and give due consideration to materiality. The other financial information herein is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.
In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the consolidated financial statements, management develops and maintains effective internal controls, including those over financial reporting, as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Corporations internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Corporations assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Management assessed, with participation of the Corporations Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the Corporations consolidated financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as of December31, 2015 . The assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on this assessment, management determined that internal control over financial reporting is effective as it relates to the Corporations consolidated financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as of December31, 2015 .
Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report.
The Corporations Board of Directors oversees managements internal control over financial reporting and financial reporting responsibilities through its Audit Committee as well as various other committees.

Comerica Incorporated and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Comerica Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria .
