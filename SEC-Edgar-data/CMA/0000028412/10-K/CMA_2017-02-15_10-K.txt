GENERAL Comerica Incorporated (Comerica) is a financial services company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Based on total assets as reported in the most recently filed Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C), it was among the 25 largest commercial United States (U.S.) financial holding companies. Comerica was formed in 1973 to acquire the outstanding common stock of Comerica Bank, which at such time was a Michigan banking corporation and one of Michigan's oldest banks (formerly Comerica Bank-Detroit). On October31, 2007, Comerica Bank, a Michigan banking corporation, was merged with and into Comerica Bank, a Texas banking association (Comerica Bank). As of December31, 2016 , Comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2 active banking and 33 non-banking subsidiaries. At December31, 2016 , Comerica had total assets of approximately $73.0 billion , total deposits of approximately $59.0 billion , total loans (net of unearned income) of approximately $49.1 billion and shareholders equity of approximately $7.8 billion .
Business Segments Comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank, and WealthManagement. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. We provide information about our business segments and the principal products and services provided by these segments in Note23 on pagesF-102 through F-105 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located in the Financial Section of this report.
Comerica operates in three primary geographic markets - Texas, California, and Michigan, as well as in Arizona and Florida, with select businesses operating in several other states, and in Canada and Mexico. We provide information about our market segments in Note23 on pagesF-102 through F-105 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located in the Financial Section of this report.
Activities with customers domiciled outside the U.S., in total or with any individual country, are not significant. We provide information on risks attendant to foreign operations: (1) under the caption Concentration of Credit Risk on page F-29 of the Financial Section of this report; and (2) under the caption "International Exposure" on pages F-31 through F-32 of the Financial Section of this report.
We provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services: (1)under the caption, Analysis of Net Interest Income on pageF-6 of the Financial Section of this report; (2)under the caption Net Interest Income on pagesF-7 through F-8 of the Financial Section of this report; and (3)under the caption Noninterest Income on pagesF-8 through F-9 of the Financial Section of this report.
COMPETITION The financial services business is highly competitive. Comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of Texas, California and Michigan, as well as in the states of Arizona and Florida. They also compete in broader, national geographic markets, as well as markets in Mexico and Canada. They are subject to competition with respect to various products and services, including, without limitation, loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services, loan syndication services, consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering, mortgage loan origination, consumer products, fiduciary services, private banking, retirement services, investment management and advisory services, investment banking services, brokerage services, the sale of annuity products, and the sale of life, disability and long-term care insurance products.
Comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions. Some of Comerica's larger competitors, including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in Comerica's market area, may make available to their customers a broader array of product, pricing and structure alternatives and, due to their asset size, may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio. Some of Comerica's competitors (larger or smaller) may have more liberal lending policies and processes. Further, Comerica's banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered. They may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure. Comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future.
In addition to banks, Comerica's banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries, including savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, leasing companies, venture capital funds, credit unions, investment banks, insurance companies and securities firms. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified 1 Table of Contents competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures.
In addition, the industry continues to consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Banks, bank holding companies, and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. Comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage. The conditions to be a financial holding company include, among others, the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed. Effective July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level. Comerica became a financial holding company in 2000. As a financial holding company, Comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies, and engage in activities that are financial in nature. Activities that are financial in nature include, but are not limited to: securities underwriting; securities dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies (subject to regulatory requirements, including restrictions set forth in the Volcker Rule, described under the heading "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments " below); insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity, provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally. A bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking.
Comerica Bank is chartered by the State of Texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking under the Texas Finance Code. Comerica Bank has elected to be a member of the Federal Reserve System under the Federal Reserve Act and, consequently, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) under the National Bank Act. Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association, by virtue of being a national bank, is also a member of the Federal Reserve System. The deposits of Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to the extent provided by law. Certain transactions executed by Comerica Bank are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In Canada, Comerica Bank is supervised by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and in Mexico, by the Banco de Mxico.
The FRB supervises non-banking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by Comerica. In addition, Comerica's non-banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state, federal and self-regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (in the case of Comerica Securities,Inc.), the Department of Insurance and Financial Services of the State of Michigan (in the case of Comerica Insurance Services,Inc.), the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (in the case of Comerica Securities, Inc.) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (in the case of Comerica Securities,Inc. and World Asset Management,Inc.).
Described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Comerica and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the business of Comerica and its subsidiaries.
Requirements for Approval of Acquisitions and Activities In most cases, no FRB approval is required for Comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. However, Federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies. Prior approval is required before Comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company (including a financial holding company) or a bank.
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires U.S. banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities. Comerica Bank's current rating under the CRA is satisfactory. If any subsidiary bank of Comerica were to receive a rating under the CRA of less than satisfactory, Comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities.
2 Table of Contents In addition, Comerica, Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association, are each well capitalized and well managed under FRB standards. If any subsidiary bank of Comerica were to cease being well capitalized or well managed under applicable regulatory standards, the FRB could place limitations on Comerica's ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of Comerica or its affiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the FRB could order Comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies, or Comerica could elect to conform its non-banking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company.
Further, the effectiveness of Comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with anti-money laundering regulations (discussed below) is also taken into account by the FRB when considering applications for approval of acquisitions.
Transactions with Affiliates Various governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB's Regulation W, limit borrowings by Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions, and also limit various other transactions between Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Comerica's affiliate insured depository institutions, on the other. For example, Section23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution's loans and other covered transactions with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10% of the institution's total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution's covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20% of its total capital. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Section23A of the Federal Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution's loans to its nonbank affiliates be, at a minimum, 100% secured, and Section23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository institution's transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act applied the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amended the definition of covered transaction to include (i) securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate, and (ii) all derivatives transactions with an affiliate, to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowing/lending or derivative counterparty.
Privacy The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including Comerica, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes.
Anti-Money Laundering Regulations The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. To comply with these obligations, Comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices, procedures, and controls.
Interstate Banking and Branching The Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (the Interstate Act), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, permits a bank holding company, with FRB approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company's home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company, prior to and following the proposed acquisition, control no more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30% of such deposits in that state (or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30%). The Interstate Act, as amended, also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states, subject to various conditions. In the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations, the host state must have opted-in to the Interstate Act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases. The 3 Table of Contents Dodd-Frank Act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the Interstate Act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly opt-in to de novo branching, in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that a bank holding company or bank be well capitalized and well managed (rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed) in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions.
Comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank, Comerica Bank, with banking centers in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan, as well as Canada.
Dividends Comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. Most of Comerica's revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to Comerica, as well as by Comerica to its shareholders. Certain, but not all, of these requirements are discussed below.
Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank& Trust, National Association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the FRB and/or the OCC, as the case may be, for the declaration and payment of dividends, if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i)such bank's retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii)the retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. At January 1, 2017 , Comerica's subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately $142 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years. Comerica's subsidiary banks declared dividends of $545 million in 2016 , $437 million in 2015 and $380 million in 2014 .
Further, federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), prompt corrective action regime discussed below, which applies to each of Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank & Trust, National Association, a subject bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming undercapitalized. In addition, Comerica Bank is also subject to limitations under Texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to its parent company, and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels.
Additionally, the payment of dividends by Comerica to its shareholders is subject to the non-objection of the FRB pursuant to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program. For more information, please see The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments in this section.
Source of Strength and Cross-Guarantee Requirements Federal law and FRB regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC (either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure), the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the FDIC's loss, subject to certain exceptions.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act FDICIA requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution's capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures, which, among others, include a Tier1 and total risk-based capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure.
Regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that, for a depository institution to be well capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and a Tier1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital measure of at least 6.5%, a Tier1 leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive. For an institution to be adequately capitalized, it must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital measure of at least 4.5% and a Tier1 leverage ratio of at least 4%. Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category.
As of December31, 2016 , Comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations.
4 Table of Contents FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the institution's parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of (i)an amount equal to 5% of the depository institution's total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, or (ii)the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.
Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions. Specifically, such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following, among other things: sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits, reduce its rate of asset growth, dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors, or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the FDIC and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate.
As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, FDICIA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises. The standards relate generally to, among others, earnings, liquidity, operations and management, asset quality, various risk and management exposures (e.g., credit, operational, market, interest rate, etc.) and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
FDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements, regulatory standards for real estate lending, truth in savings provisions, the requirement that a depository institution give 90days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch, and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the FDIC.
Capital Requirements Comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB and/or the OCC.
For this purpose, a depository institution's or holding company's assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the FRB, each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments, based on counterparty type and asset class. A depository institution's or holding company's capital, in turn, is divided into three tiers: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), additional Tier 1, and Tier 2. CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards, if any. Additional Tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus. Comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt securities, cash flow hedges, and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1 capital. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Certain deductions and adjustments to CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital are subject to phase-in through December 31, 2017. Entities that engage in trading activities, whose trading activities exceed specified levels, also are required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad market movements (such as changes in the general level of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or commodity prices) or from position specific factors. From time to time, Comerica's trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels, in which case Comerica maintains additional capital for market risk as required.
Comerica, like other bank holding companies, currently is required to maintain CET1, Tier1 (the sum of CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital) and total capital (the sum of Tier1 and Tier2 capital) equal to at least 4.5%, 6% and 8% of its total risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby letters of credit), respectively. In 2016, Comerica was also required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 0.625% in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. The minimum required capital conservation buffer gradually increases to 2.5% in 2019. At December31, 2016 , Comerica met all requirements, with CET1, Tier1 and total capital equal to 11.09% , 11.09% and 13.27% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively, and a capital conservation buffer of 5.09% of its total risk-weighted assets.
Comerica is also required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio (Tier1 capital to non-risk-adjusted total assets) of 4%. Comerica's leverage ratio of 10.18% at December31, 2016 reflects the nature of Comerica's balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy. At December31, 2016 , Comerica Bank had CET1, Tier 1 and total capital equal to 10.51% , 5 Table of Contents 10.51% and 12.40% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively, a capital conservation buffer of 4.40% of its total risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio of 9.65% .
Additional information on the calculation of Comerica and its bank subsidiaries' CET1, Tier 1 capital, total capital and risk-weighted assets is set forth in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on pagesF-99 through F-100 of the Financial Section of this report. Additional information on the timing and nature of the Basel III capital requirements is set forth below, under "Basel III: Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Regime." FDIC Insurance Assessments The FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits. Comerica's subsidiary banks are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the DIF's minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. Under the risk-based deposit premium assessment system, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if, for example, criticized loans and/or other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases. For 2016 , Comericas FDIC insurance expense totaled $54 million, including the surcharge described below.
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule in order to implement section 334 of the Dodd-Frank Act (334), which requires the FDIC to (1) raise the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35 percent, from 1.15 percent, (2) assess premiums on banks to reach the 1.35 percent goal by September 30, 2020, and (3) offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The final rule imposes a surcharge on large banks, to be assessed over a period of eight quarters, as a means to implement 334. Comerica is subject to the surcharge assessment. If this surcharge is insufficient to increase the reserve ratio to 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, a one-time shortfall assessment will be imposed on institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on March 31, 2019. Management currently estimates that, based on the final rule, FDIC expense will increase by a total of approximately $20 million over the eight-quarter period that began July 1, 2016.
Enforcement Powers of Federal and State Banking Agencies The FRB and other federal and state banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including, without limitation, and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law, the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject Comerica or its banking subsidiaries, as well as officers and directors of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments The financial crisis led to significant changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape of the financial services industry, including the overhaul of that landscape with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July21, 2010. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Dodd-Frank Act relevant to Comerica, as well as recent legislative and regulatory developments. The estimates of the impact on Comerica discussed below are based on information currently available and, if applicable, are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete.
Incentive-Based Compensation .  In June 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers senior executives as well as other employees who, either individually or as part of a group, have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements (i) should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) should be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and (iii) should be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. Banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles. Where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements, they should be promptly addressed. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness, particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. Comerica is subject to this final guidance and, similar to other large banking organizations, has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the FRB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Texas Department of Banking since 2011. As part of that review, Comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization, the 6 Table of Contents individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plans design and implementation. Comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Comerica. Further, it is the Companys intent to continue to evolve our processes going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation.
In 2016, the FRB, OCC and several other federal financial regulators revised and re-proposed rules to implement Section956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules were first proposed in 2011. Section956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements, or any feature of any such arrangement, at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss. This proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in June 2010. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $1 billion, and would impose heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes Comerica. For these larger institutions, the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentive-based payments for designated executives and significant risk-takers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institution's size, capital or overall risk tolerance. Moreover, incentive-based compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting. Further, the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation. Comerica is monitoring the development of this rule.
Basel III: Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Regime .  In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III). In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital requirement; sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), a standardized approach and an advanced approach; introduces two new capital buffers, a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer (applicable to advanced approach entities); establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio (applicable to advanced approach entities); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, the rules were effective for Comerica on January 1, 2015. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital (primarily related to intangible assets and surplus Tier 2 capital minority interest) phase in and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in at 0.625 percent beginning on January 1, 2016 and ultimately increases to 2.5 percent on January 1, 2019. Comerica is not subject to the countercyclical buffer or the supplemental leverage ratio.
Comerica's December31, 2016 CET1 and Tier 1 ratios were both 11.09 percent . Comerica's December31, 2016 CET1 and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule (4.5 percent and 6 percent, respectively).
On September 3, 2014, U.S. banking regulators adopted the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") rule, which set for U.S. banks the minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the final rule, Comerica is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality, liquid assets ("HQLA") to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule was effective for Comerica on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, Comerica was required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. At each quarter-end in 2016, Comerica was in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement, plus a buffer.
In the second quarter 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, Comerica will be subject to a modified NSFR standard effective January 1, 2018, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longer-term stable funding, over a one-year period. Comerica does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs.
Interchange Fees .  On July 20, 2011, the FRB published final rules (Regulation II) pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. Comerica is subject to the final rules.
Supervision and Regulation Assessment .  Section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the federal banking agencies to assess fees against bank holding companies with total consolidated assets in excess of $50 billion equal to the expenses necessary or appropriate in order to carry out their supervision and regulation of those companies. Comerica expensed $1.9 million for 2016, which will be assessed in the first quarter 2017.
The Volcker Rule . The federal banking agencies and the SEC published approved joint final regulations to implement the Volcker Rule on December 10, 2013. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning and sponsoring "covered funds" (e.g. hedge funds and private equity funds). The final regulations adopt 7 Table of Contents a multi-faceted approach to implementing the Volcker Rule prohibitions that relies on: (i) detailed descriptions of prohibited and permitted activities; (ii) detailed compliance requirements; and (iii) for banking entities with large volumes of trading activity, detailed quantitative analysis and reporting obligations. In addition to rules implementing the core prohibitions and exemptions (e.g. underwriting, market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and trading in certain government obligations) of the Volcker Rule, the regulations also include two appendices devoted to record-keeping and reporting requirements, including numerous quantitative data reporting obligations for banking entities with significant trading activities (Appendix A) and enhanced compliance requirements for banking entities with significant trading or covered fund activities (Appendix B). The final rule was effective April 1, 2014. The Volcker Rule generally required full compliance with the new restrictions by July 21, 2015; however, the FRB has extended the conformance period to July 21, 2017 for covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. Comerica is currently in compliance with the effective aspect of the Volcker Rule and expects to meet the final requirements adopted by regulators within the applicable regulatory timelines. Additional information on Comerica's portfolio of indirect (through funds) private equity and venture capital investments is set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on pageF-52 of the Financial Section of this report.
Annual Capital Plans and Stress Tests . Comerica is subject to the FRBs annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, as well as the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) requirements. As part of the CCAR process, the FRB undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies (BHCs), including Comerica, that have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. This capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating BHC to the FRB that describes the companys planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the FRB under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including a supervisory baseline and an adverse and a severely adverse scenario provided by the FRB. The FRB reviews both quantitative factors (such as projected capital ratios under a hypothetical stress scenario) and qualitative factors (such as the strength of the company's capital planning process). On January 30, 2017, the FRB issued a final rule stating that going forward, large and noncomplex firms, such as Comerica, would remain subject to a quantitative assessment in CCAR, but would no longer be subject to the qualitative assessment as part of CCAR; instead, the qualitative assessment would be conducted through the regular ongoing supervisory review process.
After completing its review, the FRB may object or not object to the companys proposed capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, reinstate or increase common equity repurchase programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments. In connection with the 2016 CCAR, Comerica submitted its 2016 capital plan to the FRB on April 4, 2016; on June 23, 2016, Comerica and the FRB released the revenue, loss and capital results from the annual stress testing exercises and on June 29, 2016, Comerica announced that the FRB had completed its CCAR 2016 capital plan review and did not object to the capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the four-quarter period commencing in the third quarter 2016 and ending in the second quarter 2017. Comerica plans to submit its CCAR 2017 capital plan to the FRB, consistent with supervisory guidance (SR 15-19), in April 2017 and expects to receive the results of the FRB's review of the plan in June 2017 and to release its company-run stress tests results in June or July 2017.
FRB regulations also required that Comerica and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate mid-year stress test using financial data as of June 30th and three company-derived macro-economic scenarios (base, adverse and severely adverse) and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario. On October 20, 2016, Comerica released the results of its company-run mid-year stress tests. Stress test results are available in the Investor Relations section of Comerica's website at investor.comerica.com, on the Regulatory Disclosures page under "Financial Reports." Enhanced Prudential Requirements .  The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to coordinate efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and to make recommendations to the FRB as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large, interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Act, including capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management requirements.
On February 18, 2014, the FRB issued its final regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final regulations address enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity requirements, enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, semiannual stress tests (as described above under "Annual Capital Plans and Stress Tests"), and a debt-to-equity limit for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability. They are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the US financial system, and generally build on existing US and international regulatory guidance. The rule also takes a multi-stage or phased approach to many of the requirements (such as the capital and liquidity requirements). Most of these requirements apply to Comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than $50 billion. Comerica has or will implement all requirements of the new rules within regulatory timelines.
Resolution (Living Will) Plans .  Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (covered companies) to prepare and submit to the federal banking agencies (e.g., FRB 8 Table of Contents and FDIC) a plan for their rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Covered companies, such as Comerica, with less than $100 billion in total nonbank assets were required to submit their initial plans by December 31, 2013. In addition, Section 165(d) requires FDIC-insured depository institutions (like Comerica Bank) with assets of $50 billion or more to develop, maintain, and periodically submit plans outlining how the FDIC would resolve it through the FDIC's resolution powers under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The federal banking agencies have issued rules to implement these requirements. In addition, those rules require the filing of annual updates to the plans. Both Comerica and Comerica Bank filed their respective initial and updated resolution plans by the required due dates, and will submit their 2017 resolution plans prior to December 31, 2017.
Section 611 and Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act .  Section 611 of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits a state bank from engaging in derivative transactions unless the lending limit laws of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration exposure to derivatives. Section 611 does not provide how state lending limit laws must factor in derivatives. The Texas Finance Commission has adopted an administrative rule meeting the requirements of Section 611. Comerica Bank's policy is designed to comply with the Texas rule. Accordingly, Comerica Bank may engage in derivative transactions, as permitted by applicable law.
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a comprehensive framework for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions. The structure for derivatives set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act is intended to promote, among other things, exchange trading and centralized clearing of swaps and security-based swaps, as well as greater transparency in the derivatives markets and enhanced monitoring of the entities that use these markets. In this regard, the CFTC and SEC have issued several regulatory proposals, some of which are now effective or will become effective in 2017. Most of the requirements did not impact Comerica since the Bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer nor is it a major swap participant.
On October 13, 2016, the CFTC issued an Order setting the de minimis threshold at $8 billion through December 31, 2018 with respect to the de minimis exception to the swap dealer definition. In taking this action, the de minimis threshold will not decrease to $3 billion on December 31, 2017, as initially proposed. At this time, Comerica will continue to track its dealing activity.
The variation margin requirements for non-centrally cleared swaps and security-based swaps are effective for Comerica on March 31, 2017. The variation margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with non-cleared swaps activity. Comerica is currently working toward meeting compliance with the variation margin requirements.
Consumer Finance Regulations .  The Dodd-Frank Act made several changes to consumer finance laws and regulations. It contained provisions that have weakened the federal preemption rules applicable for national banks and give state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has a broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices, and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10billion in assets. In this regard, the CFPB has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that were specifically identified as being enforced by the CFPB, as well as those specified for supervisory and enforcement authority for very large depository institutions and non-depository (nonbank) entities. Comerica is subject to CFPB foreign remittance rules and home mortgage lending rules, in addition to certain other CFPB rules.
The foreign remittance rules fall under Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB issued new regulations amending Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, effective October 28, 2013. The regulations were designed to provide protections to consumers who transfer funds to recipients located in countries outside the United States (customer foreign remittance transfers). In general, the regulation requires remittance transfer providers, such as Comerica, to disclose to a consumer the exchange rate, fees, and amount to be received by the recipient when the consumer sends a remittance transfer. Although Comerica had implemented the model disclosures provided in Appendix A to the final rule, on September 18, 2014, the CFPB extended the compliance exception period for the rule's new disclosure requirements to July 21, 2020.
On October 5, 2016, effective October 1, 2017, the CFPB issued final regulations establishing new consumer protections and disclosure requirements on prepaid accounts. The final rules definition of prepaid accounts specifically includes payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts.It also includes cards that are not linked to a deposit account to conduct person-to- person (P2P) transfers. The regulations include (i) the provision of either periodic statements or free online account information access; (ii) new account error and unauthorized transaction rights; (iii) new Know Before You Choose prepaid account disclosures; (iv) public disclosure of account agreements for prepaid accounts and (v) credit protection for linked credit accounts.Additionally, the final rule regulates overdraft credit features that may be offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts.
Comerica has positioned itself to be in compliance with the new requirements.
Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) .  In November 2013, the CFPB issued a rule implementing new TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosures (TRID) to replace the initial Truth-in-Lending disclosure and Good Faith Estimate for most closed-end consumer mortgage loans. The effective date was October 3, 2015. Significant 9 Table of Contents changes in TRID include: (1) expansion of the scope of loans that require RESPA early disclosures, including bridge loans, vacant land loans, and construction loans; (2) changes and additions to waiting period requirements to close a loan; (3) reduced tolerances for estimated fees and (4) the lender, rather than the closing agent, is responsible for providing final disclosures. Although Comerica outsources most of its consumer mortgage loans, consumer construction financing has been suspended. This regulation has also resulted in a suspension of consumer bridge loan financing. Such financing has not been a significant business for Comerica.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA) .  A revised and redesigned URLA was approved by the CFPB on September 23, 2016. The official approval expands the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act information about Ethnicity and Race that can be collected from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Regulation C, as amended by the final rule published in the Federal Register at 80 FR 66127 on October 28, 2015 (2015 HMDA final rule), will require financial institutions to permit applicants to self-identify using disaggregated ethnic and racial categories beginning January 1, 2018 in conformance with the 2016 URLA. Most consumer-purpose transactions, including closed-end home-equity loans, home-equity lines of credit and reverse mortgages, are subject to the regulation. Most commercial-purpose transactions (i.e., loans or lines of credit not for personal, family, or household purposes) are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The final rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling (i.e., home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral) and all agricultural-purpose loans and lines of credit. Comerica is monitoring and implementing changes as required.
FDIC Guidance on Brokered Deposits . On January 5, 2015, the FDIC issued guidance in the form of Frequently Asked Questions to promote consistency by insured depository institutions in identifying, accepting, and reporting brokered deposits.  On November 13, 2015, the FDIC issued proposed updates to the FAQs. All insured depository institutions (including those that are well capitalized) must report brokered deposits in their Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports). Comerica has evaluated the impact of these FAQs, including the proposed updates, to various business units throughout the organization. The FAQs had only a nominal impact.
Flood Insurance Reform.
The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), as amended by the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, modified the National Flood Insurance Program by: (i) increasing the maximum civil penalty for Flood Disaster Protection Act violations to $2,000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap; (ii) requiring certain lenders (including Comerica) to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate; (iii) directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability; (iv) amending the force placement requirement provisions; and (v) permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage. These requirements will impact Comerica loans and extensions of credit secured with residential improved real estate. The civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately. The escrow provisions became effective on January 1, 2016.
On October 31, 2016, the federal agencies issued a Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the private flood insurance rules with request for additional public comments due on January 6, 2017. Comerica will continue to monitor the development and implementation of the private flood insurance rules.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Measures The environment in which financial institutions have operated since the financial crisis, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, and changes in fiscal policy, may have long-term effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot be foreseen. Further, it is too soon for Comerica to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur as a result of the recent change in the U.S. presidential administration, or, if changes occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of Comerica.
UNDERWRITING APPROACH The loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk, so proper loan underwriting is critical to Comerica's long-term financial success. Comerica extends credit to businesses, individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice. During the loan underwriting process, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed, and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated. Important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include:  People: Including the competence, integrity and succession planning of customers.
Purpose: The legal, logical and productive purposes of the credit facility.
Payment: Including the source, timing and probability of payment.
10 Table of Contents  Protection: Including obtaining alternative sources of repayment, securing the loan, as appropriate, with collateral and/or third-party guarantees and ensuring appropriate legal documentation is obtained.
Perspective: The risk/reward relationship and pricing elements (cost of funds; servicing costs; time value of money; credit risk).
Comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk, the related costs and the expected return, while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions. Loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected risk-adjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrower's ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates.
Credit Administration Comerica maintains a Credit Administration Department (Credit Administration) which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio. Credit Administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis, including an assessment of the borrower's business model, balance sheet, cash flow and collateral. Each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by Credit Administration. Further, Credit Administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available, either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance. The goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve Comerica's risk management capability, including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio, predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk.
Credit Policy Comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies. Comerica's credit policies provide individual relationship managers, as well as loan committees, approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and Comerica's legal lending limit. Credit Administration, in conjunction with the businesses units, monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary. New or modified policies/guidelines require approval by the Strategic Credit Committee, chaired by Comerica's Chief Credit Officer and comprising senior credit, market and risk management executives.
Commercial Loan Portfolio Commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower's operations. The underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below:  The borrower's business model.
Periodic review of financial statements including financial statements audited by an independent certified public accountant when appropriate.
The pro-forma financial condition including financial projections.
The borrower's sources and uses of funds.
The borrower's debt service capacity.
The guarantor's financial strength.
A comprehensive review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, to determine the advance rates.
Physical inspection of collateral and audits of receivables, as appropriate.
For additional information specific to our Energy loan portfolio, please see the caption, Energy Lending on pagesF-30 through F-31 of the Financial Section of this report.
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Loan Portfolio Comerica's CRE loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate developers and loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Comerica's CRE loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators. Our loan-to-value limitations are, in certain cases, more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. CRE loans generally require cash equity. CRE loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. There are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor.
11 Table of Contents Consumer and Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolios Comerica's consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above, but also includes an assessment of each borrower's personal financial condition, including a review of credit reports and related FICO scores (a type of credit score used to assess an applicant's credit risk) and verification of income and assets. Comerica does not originate subprime loans. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, Comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors. These credit factors include low FICO scores, poor patterns of payment history, high debt-to-income ratios and elevated loan-to-value. We generally consider subprime FICO scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis (excluding loans with cash or near-cash collateral and adequate income to make payments) and below 660 for unsecured loans. Residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based. The remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market. Adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs.
EMPLOYEES As of December31, 2016 , Comerica and its subsidiaries had 7,659 full-time and 490 part-time employees.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION Comerica maintains an Internet website at www.comerica.com where the Annual Report on Form10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q, Current Reports on Form8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Members of the Board of Directors and the Senior Financial Officer Code of Ethics adopted by Comerica are also available on the Internet website and are available in print to any shareholder who requests them. Such requests should be made in writing to the Corporate Secretary at Comerica Incorporated, Comerica Bank Tower, 1717 Main Street, MC 6404, Dallas, Texas 75201.
In addition, pursuant to regulations adopted by the FRB, Comerica makes additional regulatory capital-related disclosures. Under these regulations, Comerica satisfies a portion of these requirements through postings on its website, and Comerica has done so and expects to continue to do so without also providing disclosure of this information through filings with the SEC.
Where we have included web addresses in this report, such as our web address and the web address of the SEC, we have included those web addresses as inactive textual references only. Except as specifically incorporated by reference into this report, information on those websites is not part hereof.
Item1A.Risk Factors.
This report includes forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements. All statements regarding Comerica's expected financial position, strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions Comerica expects to exist in the future are forward-looking statements. The words, anticipates, believes, contemplates, feels, expects, estimates, seeks, strives, plans, intends, outlook, forecast, position, target, mission, assume, achievable, potential, strategy, goal, aspiration, "opportunity," "initiative," outcome, continue, remain, maintain, "on course," trend, objective, "looks forward," "projects," "models" and variations of such words and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, might, can, may or similar expressions, as they relate to Comerica or its management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Comerica cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made, and Comerica does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.
In addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in Comerica's SEC reports (accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on Comerica's website at www.comerica.com ), the factors contained below, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance.
General political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected.
Local, domestic, and international events including economic, financial market, political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as or related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts and other factors, such as real estate values, energy prices, 12 Table of Contents state and local municipal budget deficits, government spending and the U.S. national debt, outside of our control may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect Comerica.
Governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry, and therefore impact Comerica's financial condition and results of operations.
Monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the FRB, affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part Comerica's cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments. Changes in such policies, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the value of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond Comerica's control and difficult to predict. Comerica's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies.
Proposed revenue enhancements and efficiency improvements may not be achieved.
In July 2016 Comerica announced the implementation of its efficiency and revenue initiative, GEAR Up (the "initiative") and related financial targets. There may be changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the initiative, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to the initiative and higher than expected or unanticipated costs to implement them, and some benefits may not be fully achieved. As well, even if the initiative is successful, many factors can influence the amount of core noninterest expenses, some of which are not wholly in our control, including changing regulations, benefits and health care costs, technology and cybersecurity investments, outside processing expenses and litigation.
Furthermore, the implementation of the initiative may have unintended impacts on Comerica's ability to attract and retain business, customers and employees, and could result in disruptions to systems, processes, controls and procedures. Any revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace. Accordingly, Comerica's results of operations and profitability may be negatively impacted, making it less competitive and potentially causing a loss of market share. Additionally, Comerica's future performance is subject to the various risks inherent to its business and operations.
Comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations, support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities.
Comericas liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms.
Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect Comericas liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, Comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; counterparty availability; interest rate fluctuations; general economic conditions; and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which Comerica has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. Further, Comerica's customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions, which could have a negative impact on Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.
In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the final rule, Comerica is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule was effective for Comerica on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, Comerica was required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. For more information regarding the LCR, please see the Supervision and Regulation section of this report. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our level of regulatory-qualifying capital and ability to continue to comply with the LCR framework.
Further, if Comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms, or if Comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, Comericas liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
13 Table of Contents  Compliance with more stringent capital and liquidity requirements may adversely affect Comerica.
Comerica is required to satisfy stringent capital and liquidity standards, including annual and mid-year stress testing and quantitative standards for liquidity management, as a result of capital and liquidity requirements in connection with Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act. Additional information on the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements currently applicable to Comerica is set forth in the Supervision and Regulation section of this report. These requirements, and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity, could adversely affect Comerica's ability to pay dividends or make equity repurchases, or could require Comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition and/or existing shareholders.
Further, our regulators may also require us to satisfy additional, more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the Dodd-Frank Act and the FRB's rules implementing Basel III.
Maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce Comerica's profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Declines in the businesses or industries of Comerica's customers - in particular, the energy industry - could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances, which could adversely affect Comerica.
Comerica's business customer base consists, in part, of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry, the automotive production industry and the real estate business. These industries are sensitive to global economic conditions, supply chain factors and/or commodities prices. Any decline in one of those customers' businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses, which in turn could adversely affect Comerica. Further, any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings, either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan.
In particular, oil and gas prices have remained at lower levels since mid-2014. Loans in the Energy business line were $2.3 billion , or less than 5 percent of total loans, at December31, 2016 . If oil and gas prices become further depressed and remain depressed for an extended period of time, Comerica's energy portfolio could experience increased credit losses, which could adversely affect Comerica's financial results. Additionally, a prolonged period of further decreased oil prices could also have a negative impact on the Texas economy, which could have a material adverse effect on Comericas business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding Comerica's energy portfolio, please see Energy Lending beginning on pageF-30 of the Financial Section of this report.
Unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect Comerica's financial results.
Although Comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Under such circumstances, Comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses, which could adversely affect Comerica's financial results.
Operational difficulties, failure of technology infrastructure or information security incidents could adversely affect Comerica's business and operations.
Comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk, including legal risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, failure of Comerica's controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Given the high volume of transactions at Comerica, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved. The occurrence of such operational risks can lead to other types of risks including reputational and compliance risks that may amplify the adverse impact to Comerica.
In particular, Comerica's operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in Comerica's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.
Comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, cyber attacks (including cyber attacks resulting in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems), spikes in transaction volume and/or customer activity, electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters. Although Comerica has programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to Comerica, including loss of customer data. Comerica has not experienced a cyber attack which resulted in a loss of client data. However, future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and Comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.
14 Table of Contents The occurrence of any failure or interruption in Comerica's operations or information systems, or any security breach, could cause reputational damage, jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information, result in a loss of customer business, subject Comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica.
Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operations.
Comerica is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the U.S. Treasury, the Texas Department of Banking, the FDIC, the FRB, the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which Comerica may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on Comerica's operations, investigations and limitations related to Comerica's securities, the classification of Comerica's assets and determination of the level of Comerica's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations. It is too soon for Comerica to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur as a result of the recent change in the U.S. presidential administration, or, if changes occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of Comerica. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect Comerica's businesses or operations.
Comerica relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its business infrastructure, and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations.
Comerica faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure. Third party vendors provide certain key components of Comerica's business infrastructure, such as data processing and storage, payment processing services, recording and monitoring transactions, internet connections and network access, clearing agency and card processing services. While Comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors, it does not control their operations. Further, while Comerica's vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current vendor regulations, these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk. In this context, any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect Comericas business operations, and result in financial loss, reputational harm, and/or regulatory action.
Changes in the financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing, could adversely affect Comerica's net interest income and balance sheet.
The operations of financial institutions such as Comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions, the trade, fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions' net interest income and the market value of its investment securities. Interest rates over the past several years have remained at low levels, even following the Federal Open Market Committee's 25 basis point rate rises in December 2015 and 2016. A continued low interest rate environment may continue to adversely affect the interest income Comerica earns on loans and investments. For a discussion of Comerica's interest rate sensitivity, please see, Market and Liquidity Risk beginning on pageF-32 of the Financial Section of this report.
Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. Comerica's financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions.
Reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect Comerica and/or the holders of its securities.
Rating agencies regularly evaluate Comerica, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including Comerica's financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that Comerica will maintain its current ratings. In February 2016, Standard & Poor's downgraded Comerica's long-term senior credit ratings one notch to BBB+ and Comerica Bank's long and short-term credit ratings one notch to A- and A-2, respectively. In March 2015, Moody's Investors Service put global bank ratings on review following the publication of revised bank rating methodology and in May 2015, it downgraded Comerica Bank's long-term senior credit ratings one notch to A3. In February 2016, Moody's revised its outlook to "Negative." While recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets, future downgrades to Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could adversely affect Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on Comerica's results of operations or financial condition. If such a reduction placed Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit 15 Table of Contents ratings below investment grade, it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase Comerica's costs under such arrangements. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by Comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Comerica.
Comerica's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led, and may further lead, to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose Comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, Comerica's credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to Comerica. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect, possible materially in nature, Comerica.
The introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect Comerica's business.
Comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products. If Comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs, it could result in Comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in a material adverse effect on its business.
Damage to Comericas reputation could damage its businesses.
With consumers increasingly interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust, reputational risk is an increasing concern for business. Such risks include compliance issues, operational challenges, or a strategic, high profile event. Comerica's business is based on the trust of its customers, communities, and entire value chain, which makes managing reputational risk extremely important. News or other publicity that impairs Comerica's reputation, or the reputation of the financial services industry generally, can therefore cause significant harm to Comericas business and prospects. Further, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding Comerica, whether or not true, may result in harm to Comericas prospects.
Comerica may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market, and deliver new products and services to its customers.
The financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Comerica's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands, meet regulatory requirements, and create additional efficiencies in Comerica's operations. Comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's financial condition and results of operations.
Competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within Comerica's markets may change.
Comerica operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates. Comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions. Some of Comerica's larger competitors, including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in Comerica's market area, may make available to their customers a broader array of product, pricing and structure alternatives and, due to their asset size, may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio. Some of Comerica's competitors (larger or smaller) may have more liberal lending policies and processes.
Additionally, the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation. For more information, see the Supervision and Regulation section of this report. Such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology, personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions, including Comerica, to engage in certain activities. Comerica's competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due 16 Table of Contents to their asset size or types of products offered. They may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure.
If Comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets, business could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Changes in customer behavior may adversely impact Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Comerica uses a variety of financial tools, models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Comerica's control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect Comerica's ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements.
Further, difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels. A decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Comerica, Comerica's customers and others in the financial institutions industry.
Any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to Comerica's business and operations.
Difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent Comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition, or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected.
Further, the assimilation of the acquired entity's customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of Comerica's businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect Comerica's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. These matters could have an adverse effect on Comerica for an undetermined period. Comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of Comerica.
Management's ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.
The financial services industry is very competitive. Comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers, but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. While management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships, Comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers. Failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact Comerica's earnings.
Management's ability to retain key officers and employees may change.
Comerica's future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel. Comerica's future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and Comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for Comerica to hire personnel over time.
Further, Comerica's ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. In 2016, the FRB, OCC and several other federal financial regulators revised and re-proposed rules to implement Section956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements, or any feature of any such arrangement, at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $1 billion, and would impose heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes Comerica. For these larger institutions, the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentive-based payments for designated executives and significant risk-takers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institution's size, capital or overall risk tolerance. Moreover, incentive-based compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting. Further, the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation. Accordingly, Comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions (as referenced above) or companies in other industries, which may not be subject to the same requirements.
17 Table of Contents Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, or Comerica's inability to attract and retain skilled employees.
Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving Comerica and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect Comerica or the financial services industry in general.
Comerica has been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that Comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of Comerica's efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by Comerica's regulators that could materially adversely affect Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could adversely affect Comerica's results of operations and financial condition.
Methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective.
Instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, Comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.
Terrorist activities or other hostilities may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica.
Terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt Comerica's operations or those of its customers. In addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm Comerica's operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm Comerica's stock price and may limit the capital resources available to Comerica and its customers. This could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of Comerica's common stock.
Catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica.
Comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in California, Texas, Florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods, the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change. These types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, Comerica's business and customers and have posed physical risks to Comerica's property. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on Comerica's customers and in turn, on Comerica. A significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect Comerica's operating results.
The tax treatment of corporations could be subject to potential legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations.
The present federal income tax treatment of corporations may be modified by legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time. For example, the current administration has indicated it will propose reductions to the corporate statutory tax rate. A decline in the federal corporate tax rate may lower Comericas tax provision expense. However, it may also significantly decrease the value of Comericas deferred tax assets (DTAs), which would result in a reduction of net income in the period in which the tax change is enacted. At December 31, 2016, Comericas net DTAs were approximately $217 million.
As well, if the President and Congress approve comprehensive tax reform, low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs), New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs), the beneficial tax treatment of bank-owned life insurance or other current tax positions taken by Comerica could be at risk. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect Comerica.
18 Table of Contents  Changes in accounting standards could materially impact Comerica's financial statements.
From time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Comerica's financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how Comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings.
Comerica's accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.
Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how Comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with U.S. GAAP. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in the Company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.
Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. Comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding management's judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, Comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements. See Critical Accounting Policies on pagesF-38 through F-41 of the Financial Section of this report and Note1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located on pagesF-49 through F-61 of the Financial Section of this report.

F-3 Table of Contents 2016 OVERVIEW AND 2017 OUTLOOK Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is a financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Corporation's major business segments are the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. The core businesses are tailored to each of the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. Information about the activities of the Corporation's business segments is provided in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
As a financial institution, the Corporation's principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. The Corporation also provides other products and services that meet the financial needs of customers which generate noninterest income, the Corporation's secondary source of revenue. Growth in loans, deposits and noninterest income is affected by many factors, including economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers, and the ability to add new customers and/or increase the number of products used by current customers. Success in providing products and services depends on the financial needs of customers and the types of products desired.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  The most critical of these significant accounting policies are discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this financial review.
GROWTH IN EFFICIENCY AND REVENUE INITIATIVE In the second quarter 2016, the Corporation launched the Growth in Efficiency and Revenue (GEAR Up) initiative in order to meaningfully enhance profitability. Actions identified under this initiative are expected to drive additional annual pre-tax income, before restructuring charges, of approximately $270 million for full-year 2018. Additional financial targets expected from GEAR Up include a double-digit return on equity and an efficiency ratio at or below 60 percent by year-end 2018.
2016 progress included a reduction in workforce and a significant reduction in retirement plan expense due to a new retirement program, which together resulted in 2016 expense savings of more than $25 million, as well as the consolidation of 19 banking centers. For additional information regarding retirement plan changes, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this financial review and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
Expense reductions are expected to save an additional $125 million in full-year 2017, relative to the 2016 GEAR Up savings of more than $25 million, and increase to approximately $200 million in full-year 2018. This is to be achieved through continued savings from the reduction in workforce and the new retirement program, streamlining operational processes, real estate optimization, including consolidating an additional 19 banking centers in 2017 as well as reducing office and operations space, selective outsourcing of technology functions and reduction of technology system applications.
Revenue enhancements are expected to ramp-up to approximately $30 million in full-year 2017, gradually increasing to approximately $70 million in full-year 2018, through expanded product offerings, enhanced sales tools and training and improved customer analytics to drive opportunities.
Pre-tax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million in total are expected to be incurred through 2018. This includes restructuring charges totaling $93 million , which were incurred through December31, 2016 , and an additional $25 million to $50 million expected in 2017. For additional information regarding restructuring charges, refer to Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
OVERVIEW  Net income was $477 million in 2016 , a decrease of $44 million , or 8 percent , compared to $521 million in 2015 . Net income per diluted common share was $2.68 in 2016 , compared to $2.84 in 2015 . Excluding the after-tax impact of restructuring charges associated with GEAR Up of $59 million, or $0.34 per share, net income increased $15 million, or 3 percent.
Average loans were $49.0 billion in 2016 , an increase of $368 million , or 1 percent , compared to 2015 . Excluding a $641 million decrease in Energy, average loans increased $1.0 billion, primarily reflecting increases in Commercial Real Estate, National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker Finance, partially offset by decreases in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking.
Average deposits decreased $585 million , or 1 percent , to $57.7 billion in 2016 , compared to 2015 . The decrease in average deposits reflected a decrease of $2.2 billion , or 7 percent , in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion , or 6 percent , in average noninterest-bearing deposits. The decrease in interest-bearing deposits reflected decreases of $1.3 billion , or 6 percent , in money market and interest-bearing checking deposits and $1.0 billion , or 24 percent , in customer certificates of deposit. The decrease in average deposits primarily reflected purposeful pricing discipline and strategic actions in light of new Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules, with the largest decreases in F-4 Table of Contents Municipalities (a general Middle Market business), Corporate Banking and the Financial Services Division (a general Middle Market business), partially offset by increases in the remaining general Middle Market businesses and Retail Banking.
Net interest income was $1.8 billion in 2016 , an increase of $108 million , or 6 percent , compared to 2015 . The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from higher interest rates, loan growth and a larger securities portfolio, partially offset by higher debt costs.
The provision for credit losses was $248 million in 2016 , an increase of $101 million compared to 2015 , primarily reflecting increased reserves for Energy and energy-related loans recorded in the first quarter 2016, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net credit-related charge-offs were $157 million , or 0.32 percent of average loans, for 2016 , an increase of $46 million compared to 2015 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in charge-offs in the Energy portfolio.
Noninterest income increased $16 million , or 2 percent , in 2016 , compared to 2015 . Customer-driven fees increased $22 million and non-fee categories declined $6 million. An increase in card fees as well as growth in fiduciary, customer derivative and foreign exchange income was partially offset by lower commercial lending fees and investment banking income.
Noninterest expenses increased $103 million , or 6 percent , in 2016 , compared to 2015 . Excluding $93 million of restructuring charges related to the GEAR Up initiative and $33 million from the net release of litigation reserves in 2015 , noninterest expenses decreased $23 million . This primarily reflected a decrease of $48 million in salaries and benefits expense, including GEAR Up savings estimated to be in excess of $25 million as well as an additional decrease in pension expense, partially offset by the impact of merit increases and one additional day in 2016 . Additionally, increases in technology expense, outside processing fees and FDIC insurance premiums were partially offset by decreases in state business taxes and gains from the early termination of leveraged lease transactions.
The provision for income taxes decreased $36 million in 2016 , compared to 2015 . The effective tax rate was 28.8 percent in 2016 , compared to 30.5 percent in 2015 , primarily reflecting a $10 million increase in tax benefits from the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions.
The quarterly dividend was increased to 22 cents per share in April 2016 and to 23 cents per share in July 2016.
The Corporation repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock during 2016 under the equity repurchase program. Together with dividends of $0.89 per share, $458 million , or 96 percent of 2016 net income, was returned to shareholders.
2017 OUTLOOK Management expectations for 2017 , compared to 2016 , assuming a continuation of the current economic and low rate environment as well as contributions from the GEAR Up initiative of $30 million in revenue and $125 million in expense savings, are as follows:  Average loans higher, in line with Gross Domestic Product growth, reflecting increases in most lines of business and reduced headwinds from a declining Energy portfolio.
Net interest income higher, reflecting the benefit from the December 2016 short-term rate increase and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs and minor loan yield comparison.
Full-year benefit from the December rise in short-term rates expected to be more than $70 million, assuming a 25 percent deposit beta.
Provision for credit losses lower, with continued solid performance of the overall portfolio.
Provision and net charge-offs in line with historical normal levels of 30-40 basis points.
Noninterest income higher, with the execution of GEAR Up opportunities, modest growth in treasury management and card fees, as well as wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services.
Increase of 4 percent to 6 percent.
Noninterest expenses lower, reflecting lower restructuring charges and an additional $125 million in GEAR Up savings, relative to 2016 GEAR Up savings of more than $25 million. Outside processing is expected to increase in line with growing revenue. Headwinds include increased technology costs and higher FDIC insurance expense, as well as typical inflationary pressure. The gains of $13 million in 2016 from early terminations of certain leveraged lease transactions are not expected to repeat.
Restructuring charges of $25 million to $50 million, compared to $93 million in 2016.
Remaining noninterest expenses 1 percent to 2 percent lower.
Decrease of 4 percent to 5 percent including restructuring charges.
Income tax expense to approximate 33 percent of pre-tax income excluding the impact of discrete items such as the tax benefit related to stock compensation of approximately $14 million recorded during January 2017.

NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Gains and losses related to the effective portion of risk management interest rate swaps that qualify as hedges are included with the interest expense of the hedged item. Net interest income comprised 63 percent , 62 percent , and 66 percent of total revenues in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. The decrease in net interest income as a percentage of total revenues in 2015 was due to an increase in noninterest income resulting from a change in the accounting presentation associated with contractual changes to a card program. Refer to the Analysis of Net Interest Income and the Rate Volume Analysis tables above for an analysis of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 and details of the components of the change in net interest income for 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014 .
Net interest income was $1.8 billion in 2016 , an increase of $108 million compared to 2015 . The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from higher yields on loans and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits, driven mainly by increases in short-term rates, and earning asset volume, partially offset by higher funding costs, primarily the result of higher costs on debt swapped to variable rate and new Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings in the second quarter 2016. For additional information regarding medium- and long-term debt, refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Average earning assets increased $1.4 billion , or 2 percent , primarily reflecting increases of $2.1 billion in average investment securities and $368 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks.
The net interest margin (FTE) in 2016 increased 11 basis points to 2.71 percent , from 2.60 percent in 2015 , primarily due to higher loan yields and the reinvestment of FRB deposits into higher yielding Treasury securities, partially offset by the impact of higher funding costs. The increase in loan yields primarily reflected a benefit from an increase in short-term rates. Average balances deposited with the FRB were $4.9 billion and $6.0 billion in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and are included in interest- F-7 Table of Contents bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated balance sheets. Lower yielding FRB deposits decreased net interest margin by 17 basis points in 2016 and 23 basis points in 2015 .
The Corporation utilizes various asset and liability management strategies to manage net interest income exposure to interest rate risk. Refer to the Market and Liquidity Risk section of this financial review for additional information regarding the Corporation's asset and liability management policies.
PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses was $248 million in 2016 , compared to $147 million in 2015 . The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.
The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $241 million in 2016 , an increase of $99 million compared to $142 million in 2015 , primarily reflecting increased reserves for Energy and energy-related loans recorded in the first quarter 2016, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio.
Net loan charge-offs in 2016 increased $46 million to $146 million , or 0.30 percent of average total loans, compared to $100 million , or 0.21 percent , in 2015 . The increase primarily reflected an increase in charge-offs in Energy and a decrease in recoveries in Private Banking, partially offset by decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and Small Business (primarily due to the charge-off of a single large credit in 2015).
The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $7 million in 2016 and $5 million in 2015 . Lending-related commitment charge-offs were $11 million in 2016 and $1 million in 2015 .
For further discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, including the methodology used in the determination of the allowances and an analysis of the changes in the allowances, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and the "Credit Risk" section of this financial review.
NONINTEREST INCOME (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Card fees $ 303 (a) $ 276 (a) $ 81 Service charges on deposit accounts 219 223 215 Fiduciary income 190 187 180 Commercial lending fees 89 99 98 Letter of credit fees 50 53 57 Bank-owned life insurance 42 40 39 Foreign exchange income 42 40 40 Brokerage fees 19 17 17 Net securities losses (5 ) (2 )  Other noninterest income (b) 102 102 130 Total noninterest income $ 1,051 $ 1,035 $ 857 (a) Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was an increase to card fees of $182 million in 2016 and $177 million in 2015.
(b) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.
Noninterest income increased $16 million to $1.1 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.0 billion in 2015 . An analysis of significant year over year changes by individual line item follows.
Card fees consist primarily of interchange and other fees earned on government card programs, commercial cards and debit/ATM cards, as well as, beginning in 2015, fees from providing merchant payment processing services. Card fees increased $27 million , or 9 percent , to $303 million in 2016 , compared to $276 million in 2015 . The increase in 2016 was primarily due to volume-driven increases from merchant payment processing services and government card programs.
Service charges on deposit accounts decreased $4 million , or 1 percent , to $219 million in 2016 , compared to $223 million in 2015 . The decrease in 2016 primarily reflected a decrease in retail service charges.
Fiduciary income increased $3 million , or 1 percent , to $190 million in 2016 , compared to $187 million in 2015 . Personal trust fees, institutional trust fees and investment advisory fees are the three major components of fiduciary income. These fees are based on services provided, assets under management and assets under administration. Fluctuations in the market values of the underlying assets managed or administered, which include both equity and fixed income securities, and net asset flows within F-8 Table of Contents client accounts impact fiduciary income. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in institutional trust fees, largely driven by net asset inflows and increased activity in securities lending services.
Commercial lending fees decreased $10 million , or 11 percent, to $89 million in 2016, compared to $99 million in 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in unused commitment fees, largely due to a decline in Energy commitments, and a decrease in syndication agent fees.
Letter of credit fees decreased $3 million , or 4 percent , to $50 million in 2016 , compared to $53 million in 2015 . The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to pricing actions taken based on changes in regulatory rules.
Other noninterest income was unchanged at $102 million in 2016 , compared to 2015 . The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of income.
(in millions) Years Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Customer derivative income $ 27 $ 18 $ 22 Insurance commissions 10 10 13 Investment banking fees 7 12 18 Income from principal investing and warrants 7 6 10 Securities trading income 6 9 9 Deferred compensation asset returns (a) 3  6 Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (2 ) 2 8 All other noninterest income 44 45 44 Other noninterest income $ 102 $ 102 $ 130 ( a) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting change in liability is reported in salaries and benefits expense.
The increase in customer derivative income primarily reflected an increase in income from interest rate derivative contracts, in part due to net favorable derivative credit valuation adjustments in 2016, compared to net unfavorable adjustments in 2015. The decline in investment banking fees was largely due to decreased activity in the energy markets, while income from unconsolidated subsidiaries reflected the termination of a joint venture with a payment processor in the second quarter 2015 and was more than offset by the increase in merchant payment processing services revenue included in card fees.
NONINTEREST EXPENSES (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Salaries and benefits expense $ 961 $ 1,009 $ 980 Outside processing fee expense 336 (a) 318 (a) 111 Net occupancy expense 157 159 171 Equipment expense 53 53 57 Restructuring expense 93   Software expense 119 99 95 FDIC insurance expense 54 37 33 Advertising expense 21 24 23 Litigation-related expense 1 (32 ) 4 Gain on debt redemption   (32 ) Other noninterest expenses 135 160 173 Total noninterest expenses $ 1,930 $ 1,827 $ 1,615 (a) Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was an increase to outside processing fee expense of $182 million in 2016 and $177 million in 2015.
Noninterest expenses increased $103 million to $1.9 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.8 billion in 2015 . Excluding $93 million of restructuring charges related to the GEAR Up initiative and $33 million from the net release of litigation reserves in 2015, noninterest expenses decreased $23 million , or 1 percent , in 2016 . An analysis of significant increases and decreases by individual line item is presented below.
Salaries and benefits expense decreased $48 million , or 5 percent , to $961 million in 2016 , compared to $1.0 billion in 2015 . The decrease in salaries and benefits included GEAR Up savings estimated to be in excess of $25 million as well as an additional decrease in pension expense, partially offset by the impact of merit increases and one additional day in 2016.
F-9 Table of Contents Outside processing fee expense increased $18 million to $336 million in 2016 , compared to $318 million in 2015 , primarily due to volume-driven increases related to processing for merchant services, a retirement savings program and other revenue-generating activities, as well as increases in certain outsourced services.
Restructuring charges in 2016 associated with the implementation of the GEAR Up initiative included $52 million of employee costs, $15 million of facilities costs and $26 million of other charges. For further information about restructuring charges, refer to Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Software expense increased $20 million to $119 million in 2016 , compared to $99 million in 2015, primarily reflecting continued investment in the Corporation's technology infrastructure.
FDIC insurance premiums increased $17 million to $54 million in 2016 , compared to $37 million in 2015 , in part due to federal rules implemented on July 1, 2016 in order to increase the statutorily required minimum level of the Deposit Insurance Fund, as well as higher risk-based assessment rates (due largely to impacts from the energy cycle) and an increase in the assessment base.
Litigation-related expense increased $33 million , reflecting the benefit to 2015 from the release of $33 million of litigation reserves. For further information about legal proceedings, refer to Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Other noninterest expenses decrease d $25 million , or 16 percent , to $135 million in 2016 , from $160 million in 2015 , primarily reflecting a $9 million decrease in state business taxes and a $6 million increase in gains from the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions, as well as smaller decreases in many other categories.
INCOME TAXES AND RELATED ITEMS The provision for income taxes was $193 million in 2016 , compared to $229 million in 2015 . The $36 million decrease in the provision for income taxes in 2016 , compared to 2015 , was due primarily to the decrease in pretax income as well as a $10 million increase in tax benefits from the early termination of certain leveraged leases.
Net deferred tax assets were $217 million at December31, 2016 , compared to $199 million at December31, 2015 . The increase of $18 million resulted primarily from increases in deferred tax assets related to the allowance for loan losses and net unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to lease financing transactions, partially offset by a decrease in unrealized losses related to defined benefit plans and a decrease related to stock-based compensation. Deferred tax assets of $463 million were evaluated for realization and it was determined that a valuation allowance of $3 million , related to state net operating loss carryforwards, was needed at both December31, 2016 and December31, 2015 . These conclusions were based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events.
2015 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2014 Net interest income was $1.7 billion in 2015 , an increase of $34 million compared to 2014 . The increase in net interest income in 2015 resulted primarily from higher earnings asset volume, partially offset by lower loan and investment yields. Lower loan yields were in part due to a $27 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, continued pressure on yields from the low-rate environment and changing loan portfolio dynamics.
The net interest margin (FTE) in 2015 decreased 10 basis points to 2.60 percent , from 2.70 percent in 2014 , primarily due to lower loan yields and an increase in average balances deposited with the FRB, partially offset by higher average loan balances. The decrease in loan yields primarily reflected unfavorable portfolio dynamics and a decrease in accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, shifts in the average loan portfolio mix and the impact of a competitive low-rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from an increase in short-term rates. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point in 2015 , compared to 6 basis points in 2014 . The "Analysis of Net Interest Income" and "Rate/Volume Analysis" tables under the "Net Interest Income" subheading in this section above provide an analysis of net interest income for 2015 and 2014 and details the components of the change in net interest income for 2015 compared to 2014 .
The provision for credit losses, which includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, was $147 million in 2015 , compared to $27 million in 2014 . The provision for loan losses was $142 million in 2015 compared to $22 million in 2014 . The increase primarily reflected increased provisions for Energy and energy-related loans, Technology and Life Sciences, Corporate Banking and Small Business. Net loan charge-offs in 2015 increased $75 million to $100 million , or 0.21 percent of average total loans, compared to $25 million, or 0.05 percent, in 2014 . The increase primarily reflected increases in Energy, general Middle Market (largely due to an increase in charge-offs on energy-related loans), Small Business (primarily due to the charge-off of a single large credit in 2015), Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by an increase in net recoveries in Private Banking. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $5 million in both 2015 and 2014 . Lending-related commitment charge-offs were $1 million in 2015 and insignificant in 2014 .
F-10 Table of Contents Noninterest income increased $178 million to $1.0 billion in 2015 , compared to $857 million in 2014 . Excluding the $177 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on card fees as described in footnote (a) to the table provided under the "Noninterest Income" subheading previously in this section, noninterest income increased $1 million. Card fees increased $195 million to $276 million in 2015, compared to $81 million in 2014. Two significant developments impacted the comparability of card fees between 2015 and 2014. First, the Corporation entered into a new contract for an existing card program effective January 1, 2015, which resulted in the Corporation recognizing an additional $177 million of revenue related to card fees in 2015, with a corresponding amount being recorded to outside processing fees expense. Second, the Corporation changed its business model for providing merchant payment processing services, resulting in $17 million of additional revenue in 2015. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $8 million , or 4 percent, in 2015, primarily due to increased commercial service charges. Fiduciary income increased $7 million , or 4 percent in 2015 , primarily due to an increase in investment advisory fees, largely driven by net asset inflows, as brokerage clients continued to transition from transactional services to investment advisory services, and the favorable impact on fees from market value increases. Letter of credit fees decreased $4 million , or 7 percent in 2015 , primarily due to regulatory-driven decreases in the volume of letters of credit outstanding. Other noninterest income decreased $28 million , or 22 percent, in 2015 , compared to 2014 . The decrease primarily reflected decreases in investment banking fees, income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and deferred compensation plan asset returns. The decline in investment banking fees was largely due to decreased activity in the energy market. Income from unconsolidated subsidiaries reflected a decrease of $11 million in income from the merchant payment processing joint venture that concluded in the second quarter 2015, partially offset by a decrease in tax credit investment amortization expense. The decrease in deferred compensation plan asset returns was offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense in salaries and benefits expense. Refer to the table provided under the Noninterest Income subheading previously in this section for the details of certain categories included in other noninterest income.
Noninterest expenses increased $212 million in 2015 , compared to 2014 . Excluding the $177 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on outside processing fees as described in footnote (a) to the table provided under the "Noninterest Expense" subheading previously in this section, noninterest expenses increased $35 million, or 2 percent. Salaries and benefits expense increased $29 million , or 3 percent, in 2015 , primarily due to an increase in technology-related contract labor expenses, the impact of merit increases and higher defined benefit pension expense, partially offset by decreases in deferred compensation plan expense and lower severance and executive incentive compensation expense. Outside processing fee expense increased $207 million , to $318 million , in 2015. Excluding the impact of the above-described change in accounting principle, outside processing fee expense increased $29 million, or 24 percent, primarily due to increased third-party processing expenses, including up-front costs related to the new business model for providing merchant payment processing services, as well as an increase related to a retirement savings program and other expenses related to revenue-generating activities. Net occupancy and equipment expense decreased $16 million , or 7 percent, in 2015 , primarily the result of lease termination charges of $10 million taken in 2014 as well as the 2015 benefit from those real estate optimization actions. Litigation-related expenses decreased $36 million in 2015 , reflecting the release of $33 million of litigation reserves in 2015. The Corporation recognized a gain on debt redemption of $32 million in 2014 on the early redemption of a $150 million subordinated note, primarily from the recognition of the unamortized value of a related, previously terminated interest rate swap. Other noninterest expenses decreased $13 million , or 7 percent, in 2015 , primarily reflecting a decrease in charitable contributions to the Comerica Charitable Foundation in 2015.
The provision for income taxes decreased $48 million to $229 million in 2015 , primarily due to a decrease in pretax income as well as a $5 million tax benefit from the early termination of certain leveraged leases.
F-11 Table of Contents STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS The Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the years ended December31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.
(dollar amounts in millions) Years Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Business Bank $ 638 88 % $ 762 85 % $ 822 86 % Retail Bank 7 1 47 5 44 5 Wealth Management 76 11 85 10 84 9 721 100 % 894 100 % 950 100 % Finance (244 ) (373 ) (359 ) Other (a)   2 Total $ 477 $ 521 $ 593 (a)Includes items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division.
The Business Bank's net income of $638 million in 2016 decreased $124 million , compared to $762 million in 2015 . Net interest income of $1.4 billion decreased $80 million in 2016 , primarily reflecting an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) charges, partially offset by the benefit provided by an increase in average loans of $184 million and one additional day in 2016.  The increase in net FTP charges primarily reflected an increase in the cost of funds due to the increase in short-term market rates, lower funding credits due to a $1.2 billion decrease in average deposits, and the new 2016 FTP charges for LCR as described above. The increase in average loans primarily reflected increases in Commercial Real Estate, National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker Finance, partially offset by decreases in general Middle Market, Energy and Corporate Banking. The decrease in average deposits primarily reflected purposeful pricing discipline and strategic actions in light of new liquidity coverage ratio rules, with the largest declines in Municipalities, Corporate Banking and the Financial Services Division. The provision for credit losses increased $59 million , to $217 million in 2016 , compared to the prior year. The increase in the provision was primarily due to the increase in reserves for Energy and energy-related loans recorded in the first quarter of 2016. Corporate Banking and general Middle Market also contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net credit-related charge-offs of $145 million increased $66 million in 2016 , compared to 2015 , primarily reflecting an increase in Energy, partially offset by a decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. Noninterest income of $572 million in 2016 increased $1 million from the prior year, primarily reflecting a $19 million increase in card fees, partially offset by decreases of $11 million in commercial lending fees, $5 million in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (largely related to the exit in the second quarter 2015 from a joint venture that provided merchant payment processing services), and $4 million in investment banking fees. Noninterest expenses of $839 million in 2016 increased $61 million compared to the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of $43 million and the impact of a $30 million net release of litigation reserves in 2015, noninterest expenses decreased $12 million. The decrease was primarily due to a $12 million decrease in salaries and benefits, largely reflecting savings related to the GEAR Up initiative, an $8 million increase in gains, primarily from early terminations of certain leveraged lease transactions, and smaller decreases in several other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by increases of $8 million in outside processing fees, $6 million in allocated corporate overhead expense, largely due to increased technology expense, and $6 million in FDIC insurance expense.
F-12 Table of Contents Net income for the Retail Bank of $7 million in 2016 decreased $40 million , compared to $47 million in 2015 .

Net credit-related charge-offs of $12 million in 2016 decreased $17 million , compared to $29 million in 2015 , mostly due to a charge-off of a single credit in Small Business in 2015. Noninterest income of $189 million in 2016 increased $4 million compared to 2015 , primarily due to a $6 million increase in card fees and small increases in several other fee categories, partially offset by $4 million increase in securities losses and a $3 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expenses of $767 million in 2016 increased $33 million from the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of $38 million, noninterest expense decreased $5 million, primarily reflecting a $14 million decrease in salaries and benefits, largely reflecting savings related to the GEAR Up initiative, and smaller decreases in other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by increases of $11 million in allocated corporate overhead expense, $4 million in outside processing expense and $4 million in FDIC insurance expense.
Wealth Management's net income of $76 million in 2016 decreased $9 million , compared to $85 million in 2015 . Net interest income of $169 million in 2016 decreased $10 million compared to 2015 , primarily reflecting an increase in net FTP funding charges due to an increase in the cost of funds and a lower FTP deposit crediting rate, partially offset by the benefit from a $95 million increase in average loans. Average deposits decreased $25 million . The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $4 million in 2016 , compared to a benefit of $20 million in 2015 , primarily due to the benefit to the prior year from net recoveries in Private Banking.

Excluding restructuring charges of $12 million, noninterest expenses decreased $16 million, primarily reflecting an $8 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense, largely reflecting savings related to the GEAR Up initiative, and smaller decreases in several other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by a $3 million increase in allocated corporate overhead expenses.
The net loss in the Finance segment was $244 million in 2016 , compared to a net loss of $373 million in 2015 . Net interest expense of $435 million in 2016 decreased $194 million , compared to 2015 , primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of higher rates charged to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology, as well as an increase due to a larger investment securities portfolio.

Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. The $908 million increase in average commercial real estate loans primarily reflected construction draws and term financing, mainly with existing customers who are proven developers on projects with favorable risk profiles.

Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks and Other Short-Term Investments Interest-bearing deposits with banks primarily include deposits with the FRB and also include deposits with banks in developed countries or international banking facilities of foreign banks located in the United States. Other short-term investments include federal funds sold, trading securities and loans held-for-sale. Substantially all trading securities are deferred compensation plan assets. Loans held-for-sale typically represent residential mortgage loans originated with management's intention to sell and, from time to time, other loans that are transferred to held-for-sale. Federal funds sold offer supplemental earnings opportunities and serve correspondent banks. Interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold provide a range of maturities of less than one year and are mostly used to manage liquidity requirements of the Corporation.

F-19 Table of Contents During January 2017, 1.5 million shares were issued under share-based compensation plans as a result of employee stock option exercises and vesting of restricted shares.The discrete tax benefit recognized as a result of these issuances was approximately $14 million. Tax benefits that will be recognized for the remainder of the year will depend upon employee stock option activity and the market value of the Corporations stock on the option exercise and stock award vesting dates. Additiona lly during January 2017, the Corporation repurchased approximately 600,000 common shares under its share repurchase program.
Diluted net income per share includes the net effect of the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants. The Corporations average stock price for January 2017 was $68 compared to $46 for full-year 2016, resulting in an increase of approximately 2 million diluted average common shares.The impact on diluted net income per share from exercisable stock options and warrants outstanding for the remainder of the year will depend upon the Corporations stock price and exercise activity.
The Federal Reserve completed its 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) in June 2016 and did not object to the Corporation's 2016 / 2017 capital plan and the capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the period ending June 30, 2017. The plan includes equity repurchases of up to $440 million for the four-quarter period ending June 30, 2017 . At December31, 2016 , up to $244 million remained available for equity repurchases under the plan. Share repurchases totaled $303 million ( 6.6 million shares) in 2016. The timing and ultimate amount of future equity repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's overall capital position, financial performance and market conditions, including interest rates. Restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative are not expected to impact the pace of repurchases. The 2017 capital plan will be submitted to the Federal Reserve for review in April 2017 and a response is expected in June 2017 .

The Corporation periodically conducts stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the Corporation's forecasted financial condition under various economic scenarios and business conditions. These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of CCAR. For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.
The U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (Basel III) became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015. Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement; sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), a standardized approach and an advanced approach; introduces two new capital buffers, a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer (applicable to advanced approach entities); establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio (applicable to advanced approach entities); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital phase in and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
Under Basel III, CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders' equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock.  Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses.  Certain deductions and adjustments to CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital are subject to phase-in through December 31, 2017.
The Corporation computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors.
F-21 Table of Contents The following table presents the minimum ratios required to be considered "adequately capitalized" as of December31, 2016 and December31, 2015 .

Refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory capital requirements and capital ratio calculations.
F-22 Table of Contents RISK MANAGEMENT As a result of conducting business in the normal course, the Corporation assumes various types of risk. The Corporation's enterprise risk framework provides a process for identifying, measuring, controlling and managing these risks. This framework incorporates a risk assessment process, a collection of risk committees that manage the Corporation's major risk elements, and a risk appetite statement that outlines the levels and types of risks the Corporation accepts. The Corporation continuously enhances its enterprise risk framework with additional processes, tools and systems designed to not only provide management with deeper insight into the Corporation's various existing and emerging risks in accordance with its appetite for risk, but also to improve the Corporation's ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken.
The Corporations front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day to day management of risks including the identification, assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business.  Risks are further monitored, measured and controlled by the second line of defense, specialized risk managers for each of the major risk categories who aid in the identification, measurement, and control of organizational risks. The majority of these risk managers report into the Office of Enterprise Risk. The Office of Enterprise Risk, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for designing and managing the Corporations enterprise risk framework and ensures effective risk management oversight. Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks which may have risk interdependencies or where risk levels may be nearing the limits outlined in the Corporations risk appetite statement. These committees comprise senior and executive management that represent views from both the lines of business and risk management. Internal Audit, the third line of defense, monitors and assesses the overall effectiveness of the risk management framework on an ongoing basis and provides an independent assessment of the Corporations ability to manage and control risk to management and the Audit Committee of the Board.
The Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee, established by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board, is responsible for governance over the risk management framework, providing oversight in managing the Corporation's aggregate risk position and reporting on the comprehensive portfolio of risks as well as the potential impact these risks can have on the Corporation's risk profile and resulting capital level. The Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee is principally composed of senior officers and executives representing the different risk areas and business units who are appointed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.
The Board's Enterprise Risk Committee meets quarterly and is chartered to assist the Board in promoting the best interests of the Corporation by overseeing policies, procedures and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise Risk Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on risk matters facing the Corporation and the financial services industry. These include, but are not limited to, existing and emerging risk matters related to credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and strategic conditions. A comprehensive risk report is submitted to the Enterprise Risk Committee each quarter providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position.
Further discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of the Risk Management section in this financial review.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms. The governance structure is administered through the Strategic Credit Committee. The Strategic Credit Committee is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and approves recommendations to address credit risk matters through credit policy, credit risk management practices, and required credit risk actions. The Strategic Credit Committee also ensures a comprehensive reporting of credit risk levels and trends, including exception levels, along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks. In order to facilitate the corporate credit risk management process, various other corporate functions provide the resources for the Strategic Credit Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting and periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using approved credit policies and guidelines. Additionally, the Corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry, customer or guarantor, and selling participations and/or syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties.
Credit Administration manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy and providing business segment reporting support as necessary. The Corporation's Asset Quality Review function, a division of Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups. The Special Assets Group is responsible for managing the recovery process on distressed or defaulted loans and loan sales.
F-23 Table of Contents Portfolio Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, provides comprehensive reporting on portfolio credit risk levels and trends, continuous assessment and verification of risk rating models, quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, and calculation of economic credit risk capital.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses.
After a weak first half of 2016, U.S. economic growth improved in the second half of the year. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth stepped up to 3.5 percent in third quarter 2016. The Federal Reserve responded to the improving U.S. economic data in the third quarter 2016 by raising the federal funds rate range by 25 basis points in December 2016. There is significant economic and financial market uncertainty associated with the expected policies of the Trump Administration. Overall, the expectations are the policies will be positive for the economy and support stronger growth in 2017. Labor market indicators remain positive at the start of 2017. Pricing conditions for commodity-based industries continue to be stressed due to the strengthening U.S. dollar; however, petroleum-related prices are increasing due to more coordination from OPEC countries to constrain the supply of oil. The gain in oil prices through the second half of 2016 has helped to stabilize parts of the energy sector. Measurements of both consumer and business confidence have improved. U.S. auto sales were strong at year-end reaching an 18.4 million unit pace in December 2016. Auto sales are expected to ease from that pace but remain strong in 2017.
An analysis of the coverage of the allowance for loan losses is provided in the following table.
Years Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at end of year 1.49 % 1.29 % 1.22 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans at end of year 124 167 205 Allowance for loan losses as a multiple of total net loan charge-offs for the year 5.0x 6.3x 23.5x F-24 Table of Contents The allowance for loan losses was $730 million at December31, 2016 , compared to $634 million at December31, 2015 , an increase of $96 million , or 15 percent . The increase in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected an increase in reserves allocated for Energy and energy-related loans, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. The increase in reserves for Energy and energy-related exposure reflected additional negative migration into criticized loans, primarily in the first quarter 2016, due to the deteriorating financial condition and increased leverage of these borrowers, as well as an increased loss estimate in the event of default.

(b) Loans outstanding as a percentage of total loans.
The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.
The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $41 million at December31, 2016 compared to $45 million at December31, 2015 . The $4 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments primarily reflected the impact of decreases in unfunded commitments and letters of credit exposure, partially offset by credit quality deterioration in Energy and energy-related unfunded commitments and issued letters of credit. An analysis of changes in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is presented below.

Commercial Real Estate Lending The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category.
(in millions) December 31 2016 2015 Real estate construction loans: Commercial Real Estate business line (a) $ 2,485 $ 1,681 Other business lines (b) 384 320 Total real estate construction loans $ 2,869 $ 2,001 Commercial mortgage loans: Commercial Real Estate business line (a) $ 2,018 $ 2,104 Other business lines (b) 6,913 6,873 Total commercial mortgage loans $ 8,931 $ 8,977 (a) Primarily loans to real estate developers.
(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.
The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets, diversifying credit risk by geography and project type, and maintaining F-29 Table of Contents conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.8 billion at December31, 2016 , of which $4.5 billion , or 38 percent , were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $822 million compared to December31, 2015 . The growth in Commercial Real Estate primarily reflected construction draws and term financing, mainly with existing customers who are proven developers, on projects with favorable risk characteristics (predominantly multifamily projects located in California and Texas). The remaining $7.3 billion , or 62 percent , of commercial real estate loans is to borrowers in other business lines and consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $3.1 billion at December31, 2016 , of which $1.7 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Substantially all of the remaining $1.4 billion were owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $1.4 billion at December31, 2016 , primarily including $922 million for multifamily projects and $228 million for retail projects. No loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line that were secured by properties located in Texas were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2016 .
The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with criticized loans of $3 million and $1 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in 2016 and net recoveries of $1 million in 2015 .
Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.0 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $9 million were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2016 , compared to $2.1 billion with $16 million on nonaccrual status at December31, 2015 . Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $10 million and $5 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. In other business lines, $37 million and $44 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Net recoveries were $7 million and $13 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Residential Real Estate Lending The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.
(dollar amounts in millions) 2016 2015 December 31 Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Residential Mortgage Loans % of Total Home Equity Loans % of Total Geographic market: Michigan $ 386 20 % $ 748 42 % $ 387 21 % $ 785 46 % California 948 49 687 38 874 47 611 35 Texas 337 17 305 17 325 17 269 16 Other Markets 271 14 60 3 284 15 55 3 Total $ 1,942 100 % $ 1,800 100 % $ 1,870 100 % $ 1,720 100 % Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.7 billion at December31, 2016 . Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at December31, 2016 , and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $39 million were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2016 . The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at December31, 2016 , of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $130 million were in amortizing status and $40 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $28 million were on nonaccrual status at December31, 2016 . A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at December31, 2016 . The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.
Energy Lending The Corporation has a portfolio of Energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on larger middle market companies in the oil and gas business. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 200 borrowers at December31, 2016 ) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P) ( 70 percent ), midstream ( 17 percent ) and energy services ( 13 percent ). E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are generally subject to semi- F-30 Table of Contents annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment. About 95 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers.
In addition to oil and gas loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to oil and gas or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related'), primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences. These companies include downstream businesses such as refineries and petrochemical companies, companies that sell products to E&P, midstream and energy services companies, companies involved in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, and other similar businesses.
The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of Energy and energy-related loans.
(dollar amounts in millions) 2016 2015 December 31 Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized Exploration and production (E&P) $ 1,587 70 % $ 294 $ 910 $ 2,111 69 % $ 108 $ 967 Midstream 374 17 7 45 479 15  42 Services 289 13 27 200 480 16 24 235 Total Energy business line 2,250 100 % 328 1,155 3,070 100 % 132 1,244 Energy-related 397 45 171 624 29 187 Total energy and energy-related $ 2,647 $ 373 $ 1,326 $ 3,694 $ 161 $ 1,431 As a percentage of total energy and energy-related loans 14 % 50 % 4 % 38 % Loans in the Energy business line were $2.3 billion , or less than 5 percent of total loans, at December31, 2016 , compared to $3.1 billion , or approximately 6 percent of total loans, at December31, 2015 , a decrease of $820 million , or 27 percent . Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $4.7 billion and $6.4 billion at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases resulting in a reduction in total commitments, while the decrease in outstandings largely reflected energy customers taking actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt.
Criticized Energy and energy-related loans were $1.3 billion , or 50 percent of total Energy and energy-related loans, at December31, 2016 , compared to $1.4 billion , or 38 percent of total Energy and energy-related loans, at December31, 2015 . Criticized Energy and energy-related loans increased significantly in the first quarter 2016 due to the deteriorating financial condition and increased leverage of these borrowers, and the results of the SNC regulatory exam. Subsequently, these loans declined during the remainder of 2016 as many of these borrowers took actions to reduce the level of their bank debt. Nonaccrual Energy and energy-related loans increased to $373 million , or 14 percent of total Energy and energy-related loans at December31, 2016 , compared to $161 million , or 4 percent at December31, 2015 . The increase in these nonaccrual loans reflected the same drivers noted above. Nearly all of nonaccrual Energy loans were current on interest at December31, 2016 . Energy and energy-related net credit-related charge-offs of $121 million increased $74 million for the year ended December31, 2016 , compared to net charge-offs of $47 million for the year ended December31, 2015 . Net credit related charge-offs included $96 million from the Energy portfolio and $25 million from the energy-related portfolio in 2016 , compared to $28 million from the Energy portfolio and $19 million from the energy-related portfolio in 2015 .
The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within its loan portfolio. At December31, 2016 , the reserve allocation for Energy and energy-related loans was over 8 percent of total Energy and energy-related loans. The reserve allocation for Energy and energy-related loans appropriately incorporated the changing dynamics in Energy and energy-related loans described above, including but not limited to, migration in the portfolio and the value of collateral considered in determining estimated loss given default. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy and energy-related loans at December31, 2016 , which primarily provided for recent loss trends in the Energy and energy-related portfolio which were in excess of estimated losses based on overall portfolio standard loss factors.
International Exposure International assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure F-31 Table of Contents repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country.
Mexico, with cross-border outstandings of $650 million ( 0.89 percent of total assets), $617 million ( 0.86 percent of total assets) and $670 million (0.97 percent of total assets) at December31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, was the only country with outstandings between 0.75 and 1.00 percent of total assets at year-end 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . There were no countries with cross-border outstandings exceeding 1.00 percent of total assets at year-end 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
The Corporation's international strategy is to focus on international companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets.
The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in Mexico and Europe at December31, 2016 and 2015 .

MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.
The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.
Market Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.
Interest Rate Risk Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Approximately 90 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at December31, 2016 , of which approximately 80 percent were based on LIBOR and 20 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, F-32 Table of Contents primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.
Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.
Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the first scenario presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 75 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent.
Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.
The table below, as of December31, 2016 and 2015 , displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.
Estimated Annual Change (in millions) 2016 2015 December 31 Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Rising 200 basis points $ 212 11 % $ 212 12 % Declining to zero percent (138 ) (7 ) (88 ) (5 ) Sensitivity to rising rates was unchanged from December31, 2015 to December31, 2016 . The risk to declining interest rates is limited by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent, but reflects the recent rise in short-term interest rates, allowing for a decline of 75 basis points at December 31, 2016, relative to a 50 basis point decline at December 31, 2015.
Assuming deposit prices move with a 25 percent beta, we expect the December 2016 Federal Reserve rate increase of 25 basis points should result in a $70 million increase in net interest income over a 12-month period.
Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 75 basis point decrease in interest rates.
F-33 Table of Contents The table below, as of December31, 2016 and 2015 , displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Additionally, changes in actual deposit mix over the period impacted the results modestly.

The Corporation uses investment securities and derivative instruments as asset and liability management tools with the overall objective of managing the volatility of net interest income from changes in interest rates. These tools assist management in achieving the desired interest rate risk management objectives. Activity related to derivative instruments currently involves interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to floating rate.

The fair value of risk management interest rate swaps was a net unrealized gain of $88 million at December31, 2016 , compared to a net unrealized gain of $147 million at December31, 2015 . Risk management interest rate swaps generated $60 million and $70 million of net interest income for the years ended December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
In addition to interest rate swaps, the Corporation employs various other types of derivative instruments as offsetting positions to mitigate exposures to foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or deposits denominated in foreign currencies). Such instruments may include foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swap agreements.

Liquidity Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Liquidity is the ability to meet financial obligations through the maturity or sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds. Various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commercial commitments, may require future cash payments by the Corporation. Certain obligations are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets, while others are off-balance sheet under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The following contractual obligations table summarizes the Corporation's noncancelable contractual obligations and future required minimum payments. Refer to Notes 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these contractual obligations.

Wholesale Funding The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at December31, 2016 included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $44 million at December31, 2016 , compared to $55 million at December31, 2015 . At December31, 2016 , the Bank had pledged loans totaling $23.0 billion which provided for up to $18.5 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.
The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At December31, 2016 , $15.5 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of December31, 2016 , the Corporation had $2.8 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB maturing in 2026 , and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $3.9 billion .
In the second quarter 2016, the Bank borrowed $2.8 billion of 10-year, floating-rate FHLB advances due 2026 . The interest rate on each of eight notes resets every four weeks, based on the FHLB auction rate, with the reset date of each note scheduled at one-week intervals. Each note may be prepaid in full, without penalty, at each scheduled reset date. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to provide cost-effective funding for debt maturing in the fourth quarter 2016.
Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14.0 billion of debt at December31, 2016 under an existing $15.0 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.
The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of December31, 2016 , the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
ComericaIncorporated ComericaBank December31, 2016 Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard and Poors (a) BBB+ Negative A- Negative Moodys Investors Service A3 Negative A3 Negative Fitch Ratings A Negative A Negative DBRS A Stable A (High) Stable (a) In February 2017, Standard and Poor's revised its outlook to "Stable." The Corporation satisfies liquidity requirements with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets totaled $18.2 billion at December31, 2016 , compared to $16.4 billion at December31, 2015 . Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities.
In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule F-36 Table of Contents was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation was required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. At each quarter-end in 2016, the Corporation was in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement, plus a buffer.
In the second quarter 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation will be subject to a modified NSFR standard effective January 1 2018, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longer-term stable funding, over a one-year period. The Corporation does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs.
The Corporation regularly evaluates its ability to meet funding needs in unanticipated, stressed environments. In conjunction with the quarterly 200 basis point interest rate simulation analyses, discussed in the Interest Rate Sensitivity section of this financial review, liquidity ratios and potential funding availability are examined. Each quarter, the Corporation also evaluates its ability to meet liquidity needs under a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of December31, 2016 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.
Other Market Risks Market risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.
OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The definition includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations. The definition does not include strategic or reputational risks. Although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management, as outlined in the Corporations risk appetite statement. The appropriate risk level is determined through consideration of the nature of the Corporation's business and the environment in which it operates, in combination with the impact from, and the possible impact on, other risks faced by the Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels. The Operational Risk Management Committee monitors risk management techniques and systems. The Corporation has developed a framework that includes a centralized operational risk management function and business/support unit risk coordinators responsible for managing operational risk specific to the respective business lines.
COMPLIANCE RISK Compliance risk represents the risk of regulatory sanctions or financial loss resulting from the Corporation's failure to comply with regulations and standards of good banking practice. The impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk, as the reputational impact from compliance breaches can be severe. Activities which may expose the Corporation to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending, consumer protection, employment and tax matters, over-the-counter derivative activities and other activities regulated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee, comprising senior and executive business unit managers, as well as managers responsible for compliance, audit and overall risk, oversees compliance risk. This enterprise-wide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization. The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level.
STRATEGIC RISK Strategic risk represents the risk of loss due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks accepted, and any other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit, market and liquidity, operational or compliance risks. Mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through various metrics and initiatives to help the Corporation better understand, measure and report on such risks.
F-37 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 . These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporations future financial condition and results of operations. At December31, 2016 , the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporations Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below.
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments, and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates, including the loss content for internal risk ratings, collateral values, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, and for lending-related commitments, estimates of the probability of draw on unused commitments.
In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Corporation individually evaluates certain impaired loans, applies standard reserve factors to pools of homogeneous loans and lending-related commitments and incorporates qualitative adjustments.  Standard loss factors, applied to the majority of the Corporation's loan portfolio and lending-related commitments, are based on estimates of probabilities of default for individual risk ratings over the loss emergence period and loss given default. Since standard loss factors are applied to large pools of loans, even minor changes in these factors could significantly affect the Corporation's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if recent loss experience dictated that the estimated standard loss factors would be changed by five percent of the estimate across all loan risk ratings, the allowance for loan losses as of December31, 2016 would change by approximately $30 million . Loss emergence periods are used to determine the most appropriate default horizon associated with the calculation of probabilities of default. Loss emergence periods tend to lengthen during benign economic periods and shorten during periods of economic distress. Considered in isolation, lengthening the loss emergence period assumption would result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses. Because standard loss factors are applied to pools of loans based on the Corporation's internal risk rating system, loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan. The inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the Corporation's asset quality review function and incorporated in a qualitative adjustment. The Corporation may also include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of certain other uncertainties that exist but are not yet reflected in the standard reserve factors. These qualitative adjustments are based on managements analysis of factors such as portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired, observable macroeconomic metrics, including consideration of regional metrics within the Corporation's footprint, and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Deterioration in metrics and credit trends included in this analysis would result in an increase to the qualitative adjustment increasing the allowance for credit losses. Qualitative reserves at December31, 2016 primarily included components for portfolios where recent loss trends were in excess of estimated losses based on overall portfolio standard loss factors, geographic and industry concentration risks, and changes in market conditions compared to the conditions that existed at the date of the most recent annual update to standard reserve factors.
For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. A substantial majority of the allowance is assigned to business segments. Any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the Business Bank segment.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT Investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.
Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the F-38 Table of Contents measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements includes information about the fair value hierarchy, the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities and the valuation methodologies and key inputs used.
At December31, 2016 , assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented 97.0 percent and 100.0 percent of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, respectively, and Level 3 assets totaled $351 million , or 3.0 percent of total assets recorded at fair value. Valuations generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3. Unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists often involves significant judgments about assumptions, such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both liquidity and risk premiums, and in many cases may not reflect amounts exchanged in a current sale of the financial instrument. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, the Corporation would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.
GOODWILL At December31, 2016 and 2015 , goodwill totaled $635 million , allocated to the Corporation's three reporting units as follows: $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management.
In performing the annual impairment test, the Corporation compares the carrying amount of identified reporting units, including goodwill, with their estimated fair value. The Corporation considers the carrying value of each reporting unit to be the greater of economic or regulatory capital. Economic capital is assigned using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation. Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio that is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation.
Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium.
Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.
The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2016 . The Corporation's assumptions included modest increases to the Federal funds target rate until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2016 , the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The results of the annual test of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate. For further information about the Corporation's goodwill accounting policy, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
PENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING The Corporation has a qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Prior to January 1, 2017, the plans were in effect for substantially all salaried employees hired before January 1, 2007. In October 2016, the Corporation modified its F-39 Table of Contents defined benefit plans to convert most participants, including employees participating in the Corporation's defined contribution plan, to a cash balance formula effective January 1, 2017. Participants who were age 60 or older as of December31, 2016 continue to be eligible for the final average pay benefit. In addition, the Corporation added a lump-sum payment option, effective January 1, 2017. These changes were part of the GEAR Up initiative. For more information about the defined benefit pension plan modifications, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Benefits under the cash balance formula are based on years of service, age, compensation and an interest credit based on the 30-year Treasury rate. Assumptions are made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation, the long-term rate of return expected on plan assets, the form of payment election and the projected mortality rate. The discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets are invested in certain collective investment funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, and corporate and municipal bonds and notes. The form of payment election assumption is based on market experience. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third-parties such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA), considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources. The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations.
The assumptions used to calculate 2017 defined benefit plan pension expense (benefit) were as follows: Discount rate 4.23 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.50 % Lump sum payment election rate: Existing participants 60 % Future participants 80 % Mortality table: Base table (a) RP-2016 Mortality improvement scale (a) MP-2016 (a) Issued by the Society of Actuaries in October 2016.
In 2017 , total retirement plan expense, including defined contribution plan expense, is expected to decrease by approximately $32 million. The $6 million defined benefit pension expense recorded in 2016 is expected to improve by approximately $22 million to a benefit of about $16 million in 2017 primarily as a result of the previously described plan amendments.
Changing the 2017 discount rate and long-term rate of return by 25 basis points would have the following impact on defined benefit pension expense in 2017 : 25 Basis Point Increase Decrease Key Actuarial Assumption: Discount rate $ (7.0 ) $ 7.0 Long-term rate of return (6.1 ) 6.1 If the lump-sum payment election rate were zero, 2017 defined benefit pension expense would increase by approximately $6 million.
Due to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
INCOME TAXES The calculation of the Corporation's income tax provision and tax-related accruals is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions, currently or in the future, and are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes, regulations, F-40 Table of Contents judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. The Corporation is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation.
Included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law, interpretations of existing tax laws, new judicial or regulatory guidance, and the status of examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the Corporation. These changes, when they occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes and could be significant to the operating results of the Corporation. For further information on tax accruals and related risks, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
F-41 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

F-48 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization Comerica Incorporated (the Corporation) is a registered financial holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Corporations major business segments are the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and WealthManagement. The Corporation operates in three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. For further discussion of each business segment and primary geographic market, refer to Note 23 . The Corporation and its banking subsidiaries are regulated at both the state and federal levels.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain items in prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Corporation applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and the accounts of those subsidiaries that are majority owned and in which the Corporation has a controlling financial interest. The Corporation consolidates entities not determined to be variable interest entities (VIEs) when it holds a controlling financial interest in the entity and uses the cost or equity method when it holds less than a controlling financial interest. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The results of operations of companies acquired are included from the date of acquisition. Certain amounts in the financial statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform to current financial statement presentation.
The Corporation holds investments in certain legal entities that are considered VIEs. In general, a VIE is an entity that either (1)has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2)has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3)has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. If any of these characteristics are present, the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation model, and consolidation is based on variable interests, not on voting interests. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other money interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entitys net asset value. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary is defined as the party that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. The maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding book basis and unfunded commitments for future investments.
The Corporation evaluates its investments in VIEs, both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires reconsideration, to determine if the Corporation is the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required. The Corporation accounts for unconsolidated VIEs using either the proportional, cost or equity method. These investments comprise investments in community development projects which generate tax credits to their investors and are included in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets.
The proportional method is used for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). The equity method is used for other investments where the Corporation has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entitys operation and financial policies. Other unconsolidated equity investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the cost method. Amortization and other write-downs of LIHTC investments are presented on a net basis as a component of the "provision for income taxes," while income, amortization and write-downs from cost and equity method investments are recorded in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Corporation and are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
See Note 9 for additional information about the Corporations involvement with VIEs.
F-49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Fair Value Measurements The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, the Corporation uses present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used.
Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.
Trading securities, investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Corporation may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.
Fair value measurements and disclosures guidance establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. Fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, it is the Corporations policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements.
Level1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
The Corporation generally utilizes third-party pricing services to value Level 1 and Level 2 trading and investment securities, as well as certain derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Management reviews the methodologies and assumptions used by the third-party pricing services and evaluates the values provided, principally by comparison with other available market quotes for similar instruments and/or analysis based on internal models using available third-party market data. The Corporation may occasionally adjust certain values provided by the third-party pricing service when management believes, as the result of its review, that the adjusted price most appropriately reflects the fair value of the particular security.
Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates, often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values.
Following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as well as a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value disclosures for financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis. The descriptions include an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are classified. Transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period, when applicable.
Cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates the estimated fair value. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1.
F-50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Trading securities and associated deferred compensation plan liabilities Trading securities include securities held for trading purposes as well as assets held related to employee deferred compensation plans. Trading securities and associated deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and included in other short-term investments and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. Level 1 trading securities include assets related to employee deferred compensation plans, which are invested in mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and other securities traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Deferred compensation plan liabilities represent the fair value of the obligation to the employee, which corresponds to the fair value of the invested assets. Level 2 trading securities include municipal bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and corporate debt securities. The methods used to value trading securities are the same as the methods used to value investment securities, discussed below.
Investment securities Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Corporation discloses estimated fair values of investment securities held-to-maturity, which is determined in the same manner as investment securities available-for-sale. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored entities and corporate debt securities. The fair value of Level 2 securities is determined using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or pricing models based on observable market data inputs, primarily interest rates, spreads and prepayment information.
Securities classified as Level 3 represent securities in less liquid markets requiring significant management assumptions when determining fair value. Auction-rate securities comprise Level 3 investment securities available-for-sale. The Corporate Development Department, with appropriate oversight and approval provided by senior management, is responsible for determining the valuation methodology for auction-rate securities and for updating significant inputs. Valuation results, including an analysis of changes to the valuation methodology and significant inputs, are provided to senior management for review on a quarterly basis.
Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale, included in other short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets, are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held-for-sale may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. The fair value is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, the Corporation classifies both loans held-for-sale subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments and the estimated fair value of loans held-for sale as Level 2.
Loans The Corporation does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, the Corporation may establish a specific allowance for an impaired loan based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Such loan values are reported as nonrecurring fair value measurements. Collateral values supporting individually evaluated impaired loans are evaluated quarterly. When management determines that the fair value of the collateral requires additional adjustments, either as a result of non-current appraisal value or when there is no observable market price, the Corporation classifies the impaired loan as Level 3. The Special Assets Group is responsible for performing quarterly credit quality reviews for all impaired loans as part of the quarterly allowance for loan losses process overseen by the Chief Credit Officer, during which valuation adjustments to updated collateral values are determined.
The Corporation discloses fair value estimates for loans. The estimated fair value is determined based on characteristics such as loan category, repricing features and remaining maturity, and includes prepayment and credit loss estimates. For variable rate business loans that reprice frequently, the estimated fair value is based on carrying values adjusted for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. For other business loans and retail loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model that employs a discount rate that reflects the Corporation's current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of loans held for investment as Level 3.
Customers liability on acceptances outstanding and acceptances outstanding Customers' liability on acceptances outstanding is included in "accrued income and other assets" and acceptances outstanding are included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Due to their short-term nature, the F-51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries carrying amount of these instruments approximates the estimated fair value. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1.
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities Derivative instruments held or issued for risk management or customer-initiated activities are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. Fair value for over-the-counter derivative instruments is measured on a recurring basis using internally developed models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities. The Corporation manages credit risk on its derivative positions based on whether the derivatives are being settled through a clearinghouse or bilaterally with each counterparty. For derivative positions settled on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis, the Corporation calculates credit valuation adjustments, included in the fair value of these instruments, on the basis of its relationships at the counterparty portfolio/master netting agreement level. These credit valuation adjustments are determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Corporation, as appropriate, to the total expected exposure of the derivative after considering collateral and other master netting arrangements. These adjustments, which are considered Level 3 inputs, are based on estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. When credit valuation adjustments are significant to the overall fair value of a derivative, the Corporation classifies the over-the-counter derivative valuation in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise, over-the-counter derivative valuations are classified in Level 2.
Warrants which contain a net exercise provision or a non-contingent put right embedded in the warrant agreement are accounted for as derivatives and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes valuation model utilizes five inputs: risk-free rate, expected life, volatility, exercise price, and the per share market value of the underlying company. The Corporation holds a portfolio of warrants for generally nonmarketable equity securities with a fair value of $3 million at December31, 2016 , included in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. These warrants are primarily from non-public technology companies obtained as part of the loan origination process. The Corporate Development Department is responsible for the warrant valuation process, which includes reviewing all significant inputs for reasonableness, and for providing valuation results to senior management. Increases in any of these inputs in isolation, with the exception of exercise price, would result in a higher fair value. Increases in exercise price in isolation would result in a lower fair value. The Corporation classifies warrants accounted for as derivatives as Level 3.
Nonmarketable equity securities The Corporation has a portfolio of indirect (through funds) private equity and venture capital investments with a carrying value and unfunded commitments of $11 million and $2 million , respectively, at December31, 2016 . These funds generally cannot be redeemed and the majority is not readily marketable. Distributions from these funds are received by the Corporation as a result of the liquidation of underlying investments of the funds and/or as income distributions. It is estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated over a period of up to 8 years. Recently issued federal regulations may require the Corporation to sell certain of these funds prior to liquidation. The investments are accounted for either on the cost or equity method and are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. These investments may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be impaired and written down to fair value. Where there is not a readily determinable fair value, the Corporation estimates fair value for indirect private equity and venture capital investments based on the net asset value, as reported by the fund. On a quarterly basis, the Corporate Development Department is responsible, with appropriate oversight and approval provided by senior management, for performing the valuation procedures and updating significant inputs, as are primarily provided by the underlying fund's management.
The Corporation also holds restricted equity investments, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock. Restricted equity securities are not readily marketable and are recorded at cost (par value) in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. No significant observable market data for these instruments is available. The Corporation considers the profitability and asset quality of the issuer, dividend payment history and recent redemption experience and believes its investments in FHLB and FRB stock are ultimately recoverable at par. Therefore, the carrying amount for these restricted equity investments approximates fair value. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of such investments as Level 1. The Corporations investment in FHLB stock totaled $122 million and $7 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and its investment in FRB stock totaled $85 million at both December31, 2016 and 2015 .
Other real estate Other real estate is included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and includes primarily foreclosed property. Foreclosed property is initially recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, at the date of legal title transfer to the Corporation, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequently, foreclosed property is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. Other real estate may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised value or management's estimate of the value of the property. The F-52 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Special Assets Group obtains updated independent market prices and appraised values, as required by state regulation or deemed necessary based on market conditions, and determines if additional write-downs are necessary. On a quarterly basis, senior management reviews all other real estate and determines whether the carrying values are reasonable, based on the length of time elapsed since receipt of independent market price or appraised value and current market conditions. When management determines that the fair value of other real estate requires additional adjustments, either as a result of a non-current appraisal or when there is no observable market price, the Corporation classifies the other real estate as Level 3.
Deposit liabilities The estimated fair value of checking, savings and certain money market deposit accounts is represented by the amounts payable on demand. The estimated fair value of term deposits is calculated by discounting the scheduled cash flows using the period-end rates offered on these instruments. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of deposit liabilities as Level 2.
Short-term borrowings The carrying amount of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings approximates the estimated fair value. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of short-term borrowings as Level 1.
Medium- and long-term debt The estimated fair value of the Corporation's medium- and long-term debt is based on quoted market values when available. If quoted market values are not available, the estimated fair value is based on the market values of debt with similar characteristics. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of medium- and long-term debt as Level 2.
Credit-related financial instruments Credit-related financial instruments include unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments generate ongoing fees which are recognized over the term of the commitment. In situations where credit losses are probable, the Corporation records an allowance. The carrying value of these instruments included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, which includes the carrying value of the deferred fees plus the related allowance, approximates the estimated fair value. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of credit-related financial instruments as Level 3.
For further information about fair value measurements refer to Note 2 .
Other Short-Term Investments Other short-term investments include trading securities and loans held-for-sale.
Trading securities are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on trading securities are included in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Loans held-for-sale, typically residential mortgages originated with the intent to sell and occasionally may include other loans transferred to held-for-sale, are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined in the aggregate for each portfolio. Changes in fair value and gains or losses upon sale are included in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Investment Securities Securities not held for trading purposes are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Debt securities for which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost. Securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI).
Securities transferred from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity are reclassified at fair value on the date of transfer. The net unrealized gain (loss) at the date of transfer is included in historical cost and amortized over the remaining life of the related securities as a yield adjustment consistent with the amortization of the net unrealized gain (loss) included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the same securities, resulting in no impact to net income.
Investment securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). In determining whether OTTI exists for debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Corporation assesses the likelihood of selling the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Corporation intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the debt security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to fair value, and the full amount of any impairment charge is recorded as a loss in net securities gains in the consolidated statements of income. If the Corporation does not intend to sell the debt security and it is more likely than not that the Corporation F-53 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries will not be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, only the credit component of any impairment of a debt security is recognized as a loss in net securities gains on the consolidated statements of income, with the remaining impairment recorded in OCI.
The OTTI review for equity securities includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment and focuses on the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that securitys performance, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and managements intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value of an equity security that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss in net securities (losses) gains on the consolidated statements of income.
Gains or losses on the sale of securities are computed based on the adjusted cost of the specific security sold.
For further information on investment securities, refer to Note 3 .
Loans Loans and leases originated and held for investment are recorded at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned income, charge-offs and unamortized deferred fees and costs. Interest income is recognized on loans and leases using the interest method.
The Corporation assesses all loan modifications to determine whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). A restructuring is considered a TDR when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Corporation grants a concession to the borrower. TDRs on accrual status at the original contractual rate of interest are considered performing.  Nonperforming TDRs include TDRs on nonaccrual status and loans which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans). All TDRs are considered impaired loans.
Loan Origination Fees and Costs Substantially all loan origination fees and costs are deferred and amortized to net interest income over the life of the related loan or over the commitment period as a yield adjustment. Net deferred income on originated loans, including unearned income and unamortized costs, fees, premiums and discounts, totaled $147 million and $226 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Loan fees on unused commitments and net origination fees related to loans sold are recognized in noninterest income.
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.
The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans include the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios.  Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.
For further information on the Allowance for Credit Losses, refer to Note 4 .
Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses represents managements assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporations loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.
The Corporation individually evaluates certain impaired loans on a quarterly basis and establishes specific allowances for such loans, if required. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that interest or principal payments will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Consistent with this definition, all loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued (nonaccrual loans) are considered impaired. The Corporation individually evaluates nonaccrual loans with book balances of $2 million or more and accruing loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR. The threshold for individual evaluation is revised on an infrequent basis, generally when economic circumstances change significantly. Specific allowances for impaired loans are estimated using one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or discounted expected future cash flows. Collateral values supporting individually evaluated impaired loans are evaluated quarterly. Either appraisals are obtained or appraisal assumptions are updated at least annually unless conditions dictate increased frequency. The Corporation may reduce the collateral value based upon the age of the appraisal and adverse developments in market conditions.
F-54 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually are evaluated in homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Business loans are assigned to pools based on the Corporation's internal risk rating system. Internal risk ratings are assigned to each business loan at the time of approval and are subjected to subsequent periodic reviews by the Corporations senior management, generally at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a circumstance that affects the credit risk of the loan. For business loans not individually evaluated, losses inherent to the pool are estimated by applying standard reserve factors to outstanding principal balances. Standard reserve factors are based on estimated probabilities of default for each internal risk rating, set to a default horizon based on an estimated loss emergence period, and loss given default. These factors are evaluated quarterly and updated annually, unless economic conditions necessitate a change, giving consideration to count-based borrower risk rating migration experience and trends, recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans, and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts.
The allowance for business loans not individually evaluated also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for (i) risk factors that have not been fully addressed in internal risk ratings, (ii) imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system, (iii) market conditions and (iv) model imprecision. Risk factors that have not been fully addressed in internal risk ratings may include portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired, portfolios where a certain level of concentration introduces added risk, or changes in the level and quality of experience held by lending management. An additional allowance for risk rating errors is calculated based on the results of risk rating accuracy assessments performed on samples of business loans conducted by the Corporation's asset quality review function, a function independent of the lending and credit groups responsible for assigning the initial internal risk rating at the time of approval. Qualitative adjustments for market conditions are determined based on an established framework. The determination of the appropriate adjustment is based on management's analysis of observable macroeconomic metrics, including consideration of regional metrics within the Corporation's footprint, internal credit risk movement and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Management recognizes the sensitivity of various assumptions made in the quantitative modeling of expected losses and may adjust reserves depending upon the level of uncertainty that currently exists in one or more assumption.
The allowance for retail loans not individually evaluated is determined by applying estimated loss rates to various pools of loans within the portfolios with similar risk characteristics. Estimated loss rates for all pools are updated quarterly, incorporating quantitative and qualitative factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans (using index-based estimates), and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts.
Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate any subsequently required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less any remaining purchase discount.
The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability in countries where the Corporation has loans, could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Significant increases in current portfolio exposures, as well as the inclusion of additional industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for credit losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies.
Loans deemed uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes allowances based on homogeneous pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. A probability of draw estimate is applied to the commitment amount, and the result is multiplied by standard reserve factors consistent with business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain for all letters of credit supporting loans and for letters of credit assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. Other letters of credit and all unfunded commitments have a lower probability of draw. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities F-55 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheets, with the corresponding charge reflected in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.
Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, reduced-rate loans and foreclosed property.
A loan is considered past due when the contractually required principal or interest payment is not received by the specified due date or, for certain loans, when a scheduled monthly payment is past due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Business loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when management determines full collection of principal or interest is unlikely or when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully collateralized and in the process of collection. The past-due status of a business loan is one of many indicative factors considered in determining the collectibility of the credit. The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged-off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. Residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status once they become 90 days past due and are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due. In addition, junior lien home equity loans less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if they have underlying risk characteristics that place full collection of the loan in doubt, such as when the related senior lien position is identified as seriously delinquent. Residential mortgage and consumer loans in bankruptcy for which the court has discharged the borrower's obligation and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to estimated collateral value, without regard to the actual payment status of the loan, and are classified as TDRs. All other consumer loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due, earlier if deemed uncollectible.
At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Principal and interest payments received on such loans are generally first applied as a reduction of principal. Income on nonaccrual loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received after principal has been fully repaid or future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or when the loan or debt security is both well secured and in the process of collection.
Foreclosed property (primarily real estate) is initially recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, at the date of legal title transfer to the Corporation and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Loans are reclassified to foreclosed property upon obtaining legal title to the collateral. Independent appraisals are obtained to substantiate the fair value of foreclosed property at the time of foreclosure and updated at least annually or upon evidence of deterioration in the propertys value. At the time of foreclosure, the adjustment for the difference between the related loan balance and fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of the property acquired is charged or credited to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent write-downs, operating expenses and losses upon sale, if any, are charged to noninterest expenses. Foreclosed property is included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation, computed on the straight-line method, is charged to operations over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are generally 3 years to 33 years for premises that the Corporation owns and 3 years to 8 years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are generally amortized over the terms of their respective leases or 10 years, whichever is shorter.
Software Capitalized software is stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Capitalized software includes purchased software, capitalizable application development costs associated with internally-developed software and cloud computing arrangements, including an in-substance software license. Amortization, computed on the straight-line method, is charged to operations over the estimated useful life of the software, generally 5 years. Capitalized software is included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles Goodwill, included in "accrued income and other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets, is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management.
The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim F-56 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess.
In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation.  Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation.
Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium.
The Corporation may choose to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the first step of the impairment test should be performed in future periods if certain factors indicate that impairment is unlikely. Factors which could be considered in the assessment of the likelihood of impairment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, stock performance of the Corporation and its peers, financial performance, events affecting the Corporation as a whole or its reporting units individually and previous results of goodwill impairment tests.
Core deposit intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis, based on the estimated period the economic benefits are expected to be received. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment for a finite-lived intangible asset exists if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset exceeds its carrying value.
Additional information regarding goodwill and core deposit intangibles can be found in Note 7 .
Nonmarketable Equity Securities The Corporation has certain investments that are not readily marketable. These investments include a portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds and restricted equity investments, which are securities the Corporation is required to hold for various reasons, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock. These investments are accounted for on the cost or equity method and are included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Indirect private equity and venture capital funds are evaluated by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. The amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value that is determined to be other-than-temporary impairment is charged to current earnings and the carrying value of the investment is written down accordingly. FHLB and FRB stock are recorded at cost (par value) and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. If the Corporation does not expect to recover the full par value, the amount by which the par value exceeds the ultimately recoverable value would be charged to current earnings and the carrying value of the investment would be written down accordingly.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments are carried at fair value in either accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument is determined by whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, by the type F-57 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries of hedging relationship. The Corporation presents derivative instruments at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets on a net basis when a right of offset exists, based on transactions with a single counterparty and any cash collateral paid to and/or received from that counterparty for derivative contracts that are subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item (i.e., the ineffective portion), if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change.
To qualify for the use of hedge accounting, a derivative must be effective at inception and expected to be continuously effective in offsetting the risk being hedged. For derivatives designated as hedging instruments at inception, the Corporation uses either the short-cut method or applies statistical regression analysis to assess effectiveness. The short-cut method is used for $400 million notional of fair value hedges of medium and long-term debt issued prior to 2006. This method allows for the assumption of zero hedge ineffectiveness and eliminates the requirement to further assess hedge effectiveness on these transactions. For hedge relationships to which the Corporation does not apply the short-cut method, statistical regression analysis is used at inception and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used has been and is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. All components of each derivative instruments gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Net hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Further information on the Corporations derivative instruments and hedging activities is included in Note 8 .
Short-Term Borrowings Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized borrowings and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash received. The contractual terms of the agreements to repurchase may require the Corporation to provide additional collateral if the fair value of the securities underlying the borrowings declines during the term of the agreement.
Financial Guarantees Certain guarantee contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the Corporation, as guarantor, to make payments to the guaranteed party are initially measured at fair value and included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The subsequent accounting for the liability depends on the nature of the underlying guarantee. The release from risk is accounted for under a particular guarantee when the guarantee expires or is settled, or by a systematic and rational amortization method.
Further information on the Corporations obligations under guarantees is included in Note 8 .
Share-Based Compensation The Corporation recognizes share-based compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for all stock awards, including those with graded vesting. The requisite service period is the period an employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award, which cannot extend beyond the date at which the employee is no longer required to perform any service to receive the share-based compensation (the retirement-eligible date). Certain awards are contingent upon performance and/or market conditions, which affect the number of shares ultimately issued. The Corporation periodically evaluates the probable outcome of the performance conditions and makes cumulative adjustments to compensation expense as appropriate. Market conditions are included in the determination of the fair value of the award on the date of grant.Subsequent to the grant date, market conditions have no impact on the amount of compensation expense the Corporation will recognize over the life of the award.
Further information on the Corporations share-based compensation plans is included in Note 16 .
Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporations revenue recognition policies as they relate to certain noninterest income line items in the consolidated statements of income.
F-58 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Card fees includes primarily bankcard interchange revenue which is recorded as revenue when earned. Effective January 1, 2015, the Corporation entered into a new contract for an existing debit card program. Guidance provided in Accounting Standards Code 605-45, " Principal Agent Considerations," indicates whether revenue should be reported gross or net for this type of arrangement. Management assessed various principal versus agent indicators provided in the guidance and concluded that the Corporation bears the risks and rewards of providing the services for the card program based on the new contract terms and, therefore, gross presentation of revenues and expenses is appropriate. This change in presentation resulted in increases of $177 million to both "card fees" in noninterest income and "outside processing fee expense" in noninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Service charges on deposit accounts include fees for banking services provided, overdrafts and non-sufficient funds. Revenue is generally recognized in accordance with published deposit account agreements for retail accounts or contractual agreements for commercial accounts.
Fiduciary income includes fees and commissions from asset management, custody, recordkeeping, investment advisory and other services provided to personal and institutional trust customers. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis at the time the services are performed and are based on either the market value of the assets managed or the services provided.
Commercial lending fees primarily include fees assessed on the unused portion of commercial lines of credit ("unused commitment fees") and syndication agent fees. Unused commitment fees are recognized when earned. Syndication agent fees are generally recognized when the transaction is complete.
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Costs Defined benefit pension costs are included in salaries and benefits expense" on the consolidated statements of income and are funded consistent with the requirements of federal laws and regulations. Inherent in the determination of defined benefit pension costs are assumptions concerning future events that will affect the amount and timing of required benefit payments under the plans. These assumptions include demographic assumptions such as retirement age and mortality, a compensation rate increase, a discount rate used to determine the current benefit obligation and a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. The Corporation updated these assumptions to reflect modifications made to the plans during the fourth quarter (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements) and to include a form of payment election assumption. Net periodic defined benefit pension expense includes service cost, interest cost based on the assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value of assets, amortization of prior service cost or credit and amortization of net actuarial gains or losses. The market-related value of plan assets is determined by amortizing the current years investment gains and losses (the actual investment return net of the expected investment return) over 5 years. The amortization adjustment cannot exceed 10 percent of the fair value of assets. Prior service costs or credits include the impact of plan amendments on the liabilities and are amortized over the future service periods of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. Actuarial gains and losses result from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value). Amortization of actuarial gains and losses is included as a component of net periodic defined benefit pension cost for a year if the actuarial net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
Postretirement benefits are recognized in salaries and benefits expense" on the consolidated statements of income during the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan or the average remaining future lifetime of retired participants currently receiving benefits under the plan.
See Note 17 for further information regarding the Corporations defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of loss carry-back capacity, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and assumptions made regarding future events. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Corporation classifies interest and penalties on income tax liabilities in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income.
F-59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Earnings Per Share Basic net income per common share is calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each share of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (distributed earnings) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Distributed and undistributed earnings are allocated between common and participating security shareholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities (e.g., nonvested restricted stock and service-based restricted stock units). Undistributed net losses are not allocated to nonvested restricted shareholders, as these shareholders do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses incurred by the Corporation. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. The dilutive calculation considers common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of stock options and performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Corporations stock plans and warrants using the treasury stock method, if dilutive. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the total of weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
Statements of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated balance sheets.
Comprehensive Income (Loss) The Corporation presents on an annual basis the components of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate, but consecutive statements and presents on an interim basis the components of net income and a total for comprehensive income in one continuous consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Pending Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (ASU 2014-09), which is intended to improve and converge the financial reporting requirements for revenue contracts with customers. Previous GAAP comprised broad revenue recognition concepts along with numerous industry-specific requirements. The new guidance establishes a five-step model which entities must follow to recognize revenue and removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in existing guidance. The guidance under ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and must be retrospectively applied. The Corporation expects to adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which includes presenting the cumulative effect of initial application along with supplementary disclosures. Under current guidance, recognition is deferred for compensation that is not considered to be fixed and determinable. Under ASU 2014-09 the Corporation believes this compensation will generally be recognized earlier as variable consideration. Based on preliminary analysis, the Corporation estimates the cumulative adjustment to retained earnings associated with such earlier recognition to be immaterial to its statement of financial position.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," (ASU 2016-01), which makes targeted amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure guidance. ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (other than equity method investments) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This change is only applied if a readily determinable fair value can be obtained. The update also requires the use of exit prices to measure fair value for disclosure purposes as well as other enhanced disclosure requirements. The guidance under ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is generally not permitted. At adoption on January 1, 2018, cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on equity investments other than equity method investments will be recognized as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amendments related to equity securities without a readily determinable fair value will be applied prospectively. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-01.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (ASU 2016-02), to increase the transparency and comparability of lease recognition and disclosure. The update requires lessees to recognize lease contracts with a term greater than one year on the balance sheet, while recognizing expenses on the income statement in a manner similar to current guidance. For lessors, the update makes targeted changes to the classification criteria and the lessor accounting model to align the guidance with the new lessee model and revenue guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2019 and must be applied using the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. Based on preliminary evaluation, the right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability is expected to be less than one percent of the Corporations total assets at adoption. The F-60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Corporation will continue to evaluate for other impacts of adoption, including potential additional regulatory costs, but does not anticipate these to be significant.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payments Accounting, (ASU 2016-09), which intends to simplify accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences and classification of awards. Among other items, the update requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a component of income taxes within the income statement rather than additional paid in capital as required in current guidance. The Corporation adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017. The recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement was adopted prospectively. Net excess tax benefits for awards that vested, exercised or expired during January 2017 approximated $4 million and were recognized as a component of income taxes during the first quarter 2017.
In connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Corporation elected to recognize forfeitures when they occur. Previously, the Corporation estimated a forfeiture rate in accordance with prior guidance. This amendment was implemented under the modified retrospective approach, resulting in a decrease to retained earnings of approximately $2 million , after tax, representing the cumulative additional compensation expense that would have been amortized through the date of adoption had this accounting policy election been in place. There were no other significant impacts identified pertaining to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments," (ASU 2016-13), which addresses concerns regarding the perceived delay in recognition of credit losses under the existing incurred loss model. The amendment introduces a new, single model for recognizing credit losses on all financial instruments presented on cost basis. Under the new model, entities must estimate current expected credit losses by considering all available relevant information, including historical and current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events. The update also requires additional qualitative and quantitative information to allow users to better understand the credit risk within the portfolio and the methodologies for determining allowance. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020 and must be applied using the modified retrospective approach with limited exceptions. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, (ASU 2016-15), which reduces diversity in the presentation of several categories of transactions in the cash flow statement. Among other things, the update clarifies the appropriate classification for proceeds from settlement of bank owned life insurance (BOLI) policies. Based on preliminary assessments, the Corporation expects to change the classification of proceeds from settlement of BOLI policies from operating activities to investing activities. Proceeds from settlement of BOLI policies totaled $16 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other changes in classification resulting from this update are not expected to be significant. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2018 and must be applied using the retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, (ASU 2017-04), which intends to simplify goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the analysis under which the implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. The update instead requires entities to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 must be applied prospectively and is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operation.
F-61 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 2 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, the Corporation uses present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used.
Trading securities, investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Corporation may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.
Refer to Note 1 for further information about the fair value hierarchy, descriptions of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as well as a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value disclosures for financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS The Corporation may be required, from time to time, to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include assets that are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, and were recognized at fair value since it was less than cost at the end of the period.

Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December31, 2016 and 2015 included loans for which a specific allowance was established based on the fair value of collateral and other real estate for which fair value of the properties was less than the cost basis. For both asset classes, the unobservable inputs were the additional adjustments applied by management to the appraised values to reflect such factors as non-current appraisals and revisions to estimated time to sell. These adjustments are determined based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis and are not quantifiable inputs, although they are used in the determination of fair value.
The following table presents quantitative information related to the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the Corporation's Level 3 recurring fair value measurement as of December31, 2016 and December31, 2015 . The Corporation's Level 3 recurring fair value measurements include auction-rate securities where fair value is determined using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. The inputs in the table below reflect management's expectation of continued illiquidity in the secondary auction-rate securities market due to a lack of market activity for the issuers remaining in the portfolio, a lack of market incentives for issuer redemptions, and the expectation for a continuing low interest rate environment. The December31, 2016 workout periods reflect management's expectation of the pace at which short-term interest rates could rise.

F-65 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS The Corporation typically holds the majority of its financial instruments until maturity and thus does not expect to realize many of the estimated fair value amounts disclosed. The disclosures also do not include estimated fair value amounts for items that are not defined as financial instruments, but which have significant value. These include such items as core deposit intangibles, the future earnings potential of significant customer relationships and the value of trust operations and other fee generating businesses. The Corporation believes the imprecision of an estimate could be significant.

At December31, 2016 , the Corporation had 228 securities in an unrealized loss position with no credit impairment, including 7 U.S. Treasury securities, 179 residential mortgage-backed securities, 14 state and municipal auction-rate securities, and 28 equity and other non-debt auction-rate preferred securities. As of December31, 2016 , approximately 96 percent of the aggregate par value of auction-rate securities have been redeemed or sold since acquisition, of which approximately 90 percent were redeemed at or above cost. The unrealized losses for these securities resulted from changes in market interest rates and liquidity. The Corporation ultimately expects full collection of the carrying amount of these securities, does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of amortized cost. The Corporation does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2016 .

At December31, 2016 and 2015 , commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in TDRs totaled $24 million and $6 million , respectively.
The majority of the modifications considered to be TDRs that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were principal deferrals. The Corporation charges interest on principal balances outstanding during deferral periods.  Additionally, none of the modifications involved forgiveness of principal. As a result, the current and future financial effects of the recorded balance of loans considered to be TDRs that were restructured during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were insignificant.
On an ongoing basis, the Corporation monitors the performance of modified loans to their restructured terms. In the event of a subsequent default, the allowance for loan losses continues to be reassessed on the basis of an individual evaluation of the loan.

During the year ended December31, 2016 , loans with a carrying value of $51 million at December31, 2016 , were restructured into two notes (AB note restructures). For reduced-rate and AB note restructures, a subsequent payment default is defined in terms of delinquency, when a principal or interest payment is 90 days past due. There were no subsequent payment defaults of reduced rate loans or AB note restructures during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
NOTE 5 - SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Concentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. Concentrations of both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk are controlled and monitored as part of credit policies. The Corporation is a regional financial services holding company with a geographic concentration of its on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activities in Michigan, California and Texas.
As outlined below, the Corporation has a concentration of credit risk with the automotive industry. Loans to automotive dealers and to borrowers involved with automotive production are reported as automotive, as management believes these loans have similar economic characteristics that might cause them to react similarly to changes in economic conditions. This aggregation involves the exercise of judgment. Included in automotive production are: (a)original equipment manufacturers and Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers that produce components used in vehicles and whose primary revenue source is automotive-related (primary defined as greater than 50%) and (b)other manufacturers that produce components used in vehicles and whose primary revenue source is automotive-related. Loans less than $1 million and loans recorded in the Small Business loan portfolio were excluded from the definition. Outstanding loans, included in "commercial loans" on the consolidated balance sheets, and total exposure from loans, unused commitments and standby letters of credit to companies related to the automotive industry were as follows: F-76 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries (in millions) December31 2016 2015 Automotive loans: Production $ 1,326 $ 1,266 Dealer 7,123 6,573 Total automotive loans $ 8,449 $ 7,839 Total automotive exposure: Production $ 2,534 $ 2,452 Dealer 8,730 8,209 Total automotive exposure $ 11,264 $ 10,661 Further, the Corporations portfolio of commercial real estate loans, which includes real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, was as follows.

At the conclusion of the first step of the annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in 2016 and 2015 the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, indicating that goodwill was not impaired. There have been no events since the annual test performed in the third quarter 2016 that would indicate that it was more likely than not that goodwill had become impaired.

These financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. Market and credit risk are included in the determination of fair value.
Market risk is the potential loss that may result from movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or energy commodity prices that cause an unfavorable change in the value of a financial instrument. The Corporation manages this risk by establishing monetary exposure limits and monitoring compliance with those limits. Market risk inherent in interest rate and energy contracts entered into on behalf of customers is mitigated by taking offsetting positions, except in those circumstances when the amount, tenor and/or contract rate level results in negligible economic risk, whereby the cost of purchasing an offsetting contract is not economically justifiable. The Corporation mitigates most of the inherent market risk in foreign exchange contracts entered into on behalf of customers by taking offsetting positions and manages the remainder through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and reviewed quarterly. Market risk inherent in derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes is typically offset by changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
Credit risk is the possible loss that may occur in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to a financial instrument. The Corporation attempts to minimize credit risk arising from customer-initiated derivatives by evaluating the creditworthiness of each customer, adhering to the same credit approval process used for traditional lending activities and obtaining collateral as F-78 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries deemed necessary. Derivatives with dealer counterparties are either cleared through a clearinghouse or settled directly with a single counterparty. For derivatives settled directly with dealer counterparties, the Corporation utilizes counterparty risk limits and monitoring procedures as well as master netting arrangements and bilateral collateral agreements to facilitate the management of credit risk. Master netting arrangements effectively reduce credit risk by permitting settlement of positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. Bilateral collateral agreements require daily exchange of cash or highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government entities to collateralize amounts due to either party beyond certain risk limits. At December31, 2016 , counterparties with bilateral collateral agreements had pledged $21 million of marketable investment securities and deposited $144 million of cash with the Corporation to secure the fair value of contracts in an unrealized gain position, and the Corporation had pledged $9 million of investment securities and posted $47 million of cash as collateral for contracts in an unrealized loss position. For those counterparties not covered under bilateral collateral agreements, collateral is obtained, if deemed necessary, based on the results of managements credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral varies, but may include cash, investment securities, accounts receivable, equipment or real estate. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk. These adjustments are determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Corporation, as appropriate, to the total expected exposure of the derivative. There were no derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position at December31, 2016 .
Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments utilized by the Corporation are negotiated over-the-counter and primarily include swaps, caps and floors, forward contracts and options, each of which may relate to interest rates, energy commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates. Swaps are agreements in which two parties periodically exchange cash payments based on specified indices applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Caps and floors are agreements which entitle the buyer to receive cash payments based on the difference between a specified reference rate or price and an agreed strike rate or price, applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Forward contracts are over-the-counter agreements to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date and price. Options are similar to forward contracts except the purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the asset during a specified period or at a specified future date.
Over-the-counter contracts are tailored to meet the needs of the counterparties involved and, therefore, contain a greater degree of credit risk and liquidity risk than exchange-traded contracts, which have standardized terms and readily available price information. The Corporation reduces exposure to market and liquidity risks from over-the-counter derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes, and transactions entered into to mitigate the market risk associated with customer-initiated transactions, by conducting hedging transactions with investment grade domestic and foreign financial institutions and subjecting counterparties to credit approvals, limits and collateral monitoring procedures similar to those used in making other extensions of credit. In addition, certain derivative contracts executed bilaterally with a dealer counterparty in the over-the-counter market are cleared through a clearinghouse, whereby the clearinghouse becomes the counterparty to the transaction.
F-79 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The following table presents the composition of the Corporations derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes or in connection with customer-initiated and other activities at December31, 2016 and 2015 .

These amounts are typically not exchanged, significantly exceed amounts subject to credit or market risk and are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets.
(b) Net derivative assets are included in accrued income and other assets and net derivative liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Included in the fair value of net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk and credit risk of the Corporation. The fair value of net derivative assets included credit valuation adjustments for counterparty credit risk of $5 million at both December31, 2016 and 2015 .
Risk Management As an end-user, the Corporation employs a variety of financial instruments for risk management purposes, including cash instruments, such as investment securities, as well as derivative instruments. Activity related to these instruments is centered predominantly in the interest rate markets and mainly involves interest rate swaps. Various other types of instruments also may F-80 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries be used to manage exposures to market risks, including interest rate caps and floors, total return swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swap agreements.
The Corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements related to medium- and long-term debt for interest rate risk management purposes. These interest rate swap agreements effectively modify the Corporations exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed-rate debt to a floating rate. These agreements involve the receipt of fixed-rate interest amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments over the life of the agreement, without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. Risk management fair value interest rate swaps generated net interest income of $60 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Corporation recognized net losses of $2 million for the year ended December31, 2016 and net gains of $2 million for the year ended December31, 2015 in "other noninterest income" in the consolidated statements of income for the ineffective portion of risk management derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt.
Foreign exchange rate risk arises from changes in the value of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Corporation employs spot and forward contracts in addition to swap contracts to manage exposure to these and other risks. The Corporation recognized an insignificant amount of net losses for each of the years ended December31, 2016 and December31, 2015 on risk management derivative instruments used as economic hedges in "other noninterest income" in the consolidated statements of income.
The following table summarizes the expected weighted average remaining maturity of the notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps and the weighted average interest rates associated with amounts expected to be received or paid on interest rate swap agreements as of December31, 2016 and 2015 .
Weighted Average (dollar amounts in millions) Notional Amount Remaining Maturity (inyears) ReceiveRate PayRate(a) December31, 2016 Swaps - fair value - receive fixed/pay floating rate Medium- and long-term debt designation $ 2,275 4.5 3.69 % 1.80 % December31, 2015 Swaps - fair value - receive fixed/pay floating rate Medium- and long-term debt designation 2,525 5.1 3.89 1.11 (a) Variable rates paid on receive fixed swaps are based on six-month LIBOR rates in effect at December31, 2016 and 2015 .
Management believes these hedging strategies achieve the desired relationship between the rate maturities of assets and funding sources which, in turn, reduce the overall exposure of net interest income to interest rate risk, although there can be no assurance that such strategies will be successful.
Customer-Initiated and Other The Corporation enters into derivative transactions at the request of customers and generally takes offsetting positions with dealer counterparties to mitigate the inherent market risk. Income primarily results from the spread between the customer derivative and the offsetting dealer position.
For customer-initiated foreign exchange contracts where offsetting positions have not been taken, the Corporation manages the remaining inherent market risk through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and reviewed quarterly. For those customer-initiated derivative contracts which were not offset or where the Corporation holds a position within the limits described above, the Corporation recognized $1 million of net gains in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
Fair values of customer-initiated and other derivative instruments represent the net unrealized gains or losses on such contracts and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The net gains recognized in income on customer-initiated derivative instruments, net of the impact of offsetting positions, were as follows.

The Corporations credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table.
(in millions) December 31 2016 2015 Unused commitments to extend credit: Commercial and other $ 24,333 $ 26,115 Bankcard, revolving check credit and home equity loan commitments 2,658 2,414 Total unused commitments to extend credit $ 26,991 $ 28,529 Standby letters of credit $ 3,623 $ 3,985 Commercial letters of credit 46 41 The Corporation maintains an allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. At December31, 2016 and 2015 , the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, was $41 million and $45 million , respectively.
Unused Commitments to Extend Credit Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total contractual amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Corporation. Commercial and other unused commitments are primarily variable rate commitments. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments included $29 million and $33 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, for probable credit losses inherent in the Corporations unused commitments to extend credit.
Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit Standby letters of credit represent conditional obligations of the Corporation which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. Commercial letters of credit are issued to finance foreign or domestic trade transactions. These contracts expire in decreasing amounts through the year 2023 . The Corporation may enter into participation arrangements with third parties that effectively reduce the maximum amount of future payments which may be required under standby and commercial letters of credit. These risk participations covered $255 million and $287 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, of the $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
The carrying value of the Corporations standby and commercial letters of credit, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $44 million at December31, 2016 , including $32 million in deferred fees and $12 million in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. At December31, 2015 , the comparable amounts were $49 million , $37 million and $12 million , respectively.
The following table presents a summary of criticized standby and commercial letters of credit at December31, 2016 and December31, 2015 . The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting, periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using Board committee approved credit policies and guidelines.
(dollar amounts in millions) December31, 2016 December31, 2015 Total criticized standby and commercial letters of credit $ 135 $ 110 As a percentage of total outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit 3.7 % 2.7 % Other Credit-Related Financial Instruments The Corporation enters into credit risk participation agreements, under which the Corporation assumes credit exposure associated with a borrowers performance related to certain interest rate derivative contracts. The Corporation is not a party to the interest rate derivative contracts and only enters into these credit risk participation agreements in instances in which the Corporation is also a party to the related loan participation agreement for such borrowers. The Corporation manages its credit risk on the credit risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the normal credit review process had it entered into the derivative instruments directly with the borrower. The notional amount of such credit risk participation F-82 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries agreement reflects the pro-rata share of the derivative instrument, consistent with its share of the related participated loan. As of December31, 2016 and 2015 , the total notional amount of the credit risk participation agreements was approximately $458 million and $559 million , respectively, and the fair value, included in customer-initiated interest rate contracts recorded in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, was insignificant for each period. The maximum estimated exposure to these agreements, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments, assuming 100 percent default by all obligors on the maximum values, was approximately $3 million and $5 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. In the event of default, the lead bank has the ability to liquidate the assets of the borrower, in which case the lead bank would be required to return a percentage of the recouped assets to the participating banks. As of December31, 2016 , the weighted average remaining maturity of outstanding credit risk participation agreements was 2.6 years.
NOTE 9 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIEs) The Corporation evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Corporation is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration.
The Corporation holds ownership interests in funds in the form of limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs) investing in affordable housing projects that qualify for the LIHTC. The Corporation also directly invests in limited partnerships and LLCs which invest in community development projects which generate similar tax credits to investors. As an investor, the Corporation obtains income tax credits and deductions from the operating losses of these tax credit entities. These tax credit entities meet the definition of a VIE; however, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of the entities, as the general partner or the managing member has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities.
The Corporation accounts for its interests in LIHTC entities using the proportional amortization method. Exposure to loss as a result of the Corporations involvement with LIHTC entities at December31, 2016 was limited to approximately $414 million . Ownership interests in other community development projects which generate similar tax credits to investors (other tax credit entities) are accounted for under either the cost or equity method. Exposure to loss as a result of the Corporation's involvement in other tax credit entities at December31, 2016 was limited to approximately $8 million .
Investment balances, including all legally binding commitments to fund future investments, are included in accrued income and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. A liability is recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for all legally binding unfunded commitments to fund tax credit entities ( $159 million at December31, 2016 ). Amortization and other write-downs of LIHTC investments are presented on a net basis as a component of the "provision for income taxes" on the consolidated statements of income, while amortization and write-downs of other tax credit investments are recorded in other noninterest income." The income tax credits and deductions are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and a reduction of federal income taxes payable.
The Corporation provided no financial or other support that was not contractually required to any of the above VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
The following table summarizes the impact of these tax credit entities on line items on the Corporations consolidated statements of income.

F-85 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real-estate related assets. In the second quarter 2016, the Bank borrowed $2.8 billion of 10-year, floating-rate FHLB advances due 2026 . The interest rate on each of eight notes resets every four weeks, based on the FHLB auction rate, with the reset date of each note scheduled at one-week intervals. At December31, 2016 the weighted-average rate on these advances was 0.6188% . Each note may be prepaid in full, without penalty, at each scheduled reset date. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent upon the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB.  At December31, 2016 , $15.5 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for potential future borrowings of approximately $3.9 billion .
Unamortized debt issuance costs deducted from the carrying amount of medium- and long-term debt totaled $7 million and $8 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
At December31, 2016 , the principal maturities of medium- and long-term debt were as follows: (in millions) Years Ending December 31 2017 $ 500 2018 2 2019 357 2020 682 2021  Thereafter 3,550 Total $ 5,091 NOTE 13 - SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY The Federal Reserve completed its 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) in June 2016 and did not object to the Corporation's 2016/2017 capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the period ending June 30, 2017. The plan includes equity repurchases of up to $440 million for the four-quarter period commencing in the third quarter 2016 and ending in the second quarter 2017. During the year ended December31, 2016 , the Corporation had repurchased $303 million under the equity repurchase program.
Repurchases of common stock under the equity repurchase program authorized in 2010 by the Board of Directors of the Corporation totaled 6.6 million shares at an average price paid of $46.09 in 2016 , 5.1 million shares at an average price paid of $45.65 per share in 2015 and 5.2 million shares at an average price paid of $47.91 per share in 2014 .

Restricted stock vests over periods ranging from three years to five years, restricted stock units vest over periods ranging from one year to three years, and stock options vest over periods ranging from one year to four years. The maturity of each option is determined at the date of grant; however, no options may be exercised later than ten years from the date of grant. The options may have restrictions regarding exercisability. The plans originally provided for a grant of up to 19.4 million common shares, plus shares under certain plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled, which become available for re-grant. At December31, 2016 , 10.2 million shares were available for grant.
F-88 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The Corporation used a binomial model to value stock options granted in the periods presented. Option valuation models require several inputs, including the expected stock price volatility, and changes in input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. The model used may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee and director stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption used in the binomial option-pricing model as outlined in the table below was based on the federal ten-year treasury interest rate. The expected dividend yield was based on the historical and projected dividend yield patterns of the Corporations common shares. Expected volatility assumptions considered both the historical volatility of the Corporations common stock over a ten-year period and implied volatility based on actively traded options on the Corporations common stock with pricing terms and trade dates similar to the stock options granted. Expected option life was based on historical exercise activity over the contractual term of the option grant (10 years), excluding certain forced transactions.

NOTE 17 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Corporation has a qualified and a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Through December 31, 2016, the plans provided benefits for substantially all salaried employees hired before January1, 2007 who continued to meet the eligibility requirements of the plans. Through December 31, 2016, benefits under the defined benefit plans were based primarily on years of service, age and compensation during the five highest paid consecutive calendar years occurring during the last ten years before retirement. Salaries and benefits expense included defined benefit pension expense of $6 million , $47 million and $39 million in the years ended December31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, for the plans.
In October 2016, the Corporation modified the qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans to freeze final average pay benefits as of December 31, 2016, other than for participants who were age 60 or older as of December 31, 2016, and added a cash balance plan provision effective January 1, 2017. Active pension plan participants 60 years or older as of December 31, 2016 receive the greater of the final average pay formula or the frozen final average pay benefit as of December 31, 2016 plus the cash balance benefit earned after January 1, 2017. Employees participating in the retirement account plan as of December 31, 2016 are eligible to participate in the cash balance pension plan effective January 1, 2017. Benefits earned under the cash balance pension formula, in the form of an account balance, include contribution credits based on eligible pay earned each month, age and years of service and monthly interest credits based on the 30-year Treasury rate.
The Corporations postretirement benefit plan continues to provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for retirees as of December31, 1992. The plan also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a limited number of retirees who retired prior to January1, 2000. For all other employees hired prior to January1, 2000, a nominal benefit is provided. Employees hired on or after January1, 2000 and prior to January 1, 2007 are eligible to participate in the plan on a full contributory basis until Medicare-eligible based on age and service. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the plan. The Corporation funds the pre-1992 retiree plan benefits with bank-owned life insurance. Employee benefits expense included no postretirement benefit expense in the year ended December31, 2016 and $1 million in each of the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014 .

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The returns on the various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term rate of return. The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations.

One-Percentage-Point (in millions) Increase Decrease Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 3 $ (3 ) Effect on total service and interest cost   Plan Assets The Corporations overall investment goals for the qualified defined benefit pension plan are to maintain a portfolio of assets of appropriate liquidity and diversification; to generate investment returns (net of operating costs) that are reasonably anticipated to maintain the plans fully funded status or to reduce a funding deficit, after taking into account various factors, including reasonably anticipated future contributions and expense and the interest rate sensitivity of the plans assets relative to that of the plans liabilities; and to generate investment returns (net of operating costs) that meet or exceed a customized benchmark as defined in the plan investment policy. Derivative instruments are permissible for hedging and transactional efficiency, but only to the extent that the derivative use enhances the efficient execution of the plans investment policy. The plan does not directly invest in securities issued by the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Corporations target allocations for plan investments are 45 percent to 55 percent for both equity securities and fixed income, including cash. Equity securities include collective investment and mutual funds and common stock. Fixed income securities include U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and notes, municipal bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and money market funds.
Fair Value Measurements The Corporations qualified defined benefit pension plan utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments and to determine fair value disclosures. The Corporations qualified benefit pension plan categorizes investments recorded at fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the markets in which the investment are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. Refer to Note 1 for a description of the three-level hierarchy.
In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, "Disclosure for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share" (ASU 2015-07). ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to present certain investments for which the practical expedient is used to measure fair value at net asset value (NAV) within the fair value hierarchy. Instead, these investments are included to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the fair value investment balance on the consolidated balance sheets. The provisions of ASU 2015-07 were retrospectively applied.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure the fair value of the Corporations qualified defined benefit pension plan investments, including an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the investments are classified.
Mutual funds Fair value measurement is based upon the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. Mutual fund NAVs are quoted in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, and are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Commercial paper Fair value measurement is based on benchmark yields and quotes from market makers and other broker/dealers recognized to be market participants. Commercial paper is included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
F-93 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Common stock Fair value measurement is based upon the closing price quoted in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 common stock includes domestic and foreign stock and real estate investment trusts. The fair value of American Depository Receipts is based upon independent pricing models utilizing primarily observable inputs, generally the quoted prices for the underlying securities, and is included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets.
Corporate and municipal bonds and notes Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or pricing models based on observable market data inputs, primarily interest rates, spreads and prepayment information. Level 2 securities include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, foreign bonds and foreign notes.
Collateralized mortgage obligations and U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities Fair value measurement is based upon independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors, such as credit loss and liquidity assumptions, and are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Private placements Fair value is measured using the NAV provided by fund management as quoted prices in active markets are not available. Management considers additional discounts to the provided NAV for market and credit risk. Private placements are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Collective investment funds Fair value measurement is based upon the net asset value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. There are no unfunded commitments or redemption restrictions on the collective investment funds. The investments are redeemable daily.
F-94 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries Fair Values The fair values of the Corporations qualified defined benefit pension plan investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December31, 2016 and 2015 , by asset category and level within the fair value hierarchy, are detailed in the table below.

Defined Contribution Plans Substantially all of the Corporations employees are eligible to participate in the Corporations principal defined contribution plan (a 401(k) plan). Under this plan, the Corporation makes core matching cash contributions of 100 percent of the first 4 percent of qualified earnings contributed by employees (up to the current IRS compensation limit), invested based on employee investment elections. Employee benefits expense included expense for the plan of $22 million for each of the years ended December31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 .
Through December 31, 2016, the Corporation also provided a retirement account plan for the benefit of substantially all employees who worked at least 1,000 hours in a plan year and were not accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plan. Under the retirement account plan, the Corporation made an annual discretionary allocation to the individual account of each eligible employee ranging from 3 percent to 8 percent of annual compensation, determined based on combined age and years of service. The allocations were invested based on employee investment elections. The Corporation recognized $10 million in employee benefits expense for this plan for each of the years ended December31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 . Employees participating in the retirement account plan as of December 31, 2016 are eligible to participate in the cash balance pension plan effective January 1, 2017. Final retirement account plan balances will be transferred to the Corporation's 401(k) plan in the first quarter of 2017. Contributions to the retirement account plan will cease for periods beginning after December 31, 2016.
Deferred Compensation Plans The Corporation offers optional deferred compensation plans under which certain employees may make an irrevocable election to defer incentive compensation and/or a portion of base salary until retirement or separation from the Corporation. The employee may direct deferred compensation into one or more deemed investment options. Although not required to do so, the Corporation invests actual funds into the deemed investments as directed by employees, resulting in a deferred compensation asset, recorded in other short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets that offsets the liability to employees under the plan, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The earnings from the deferred compensation asset are recorded in interest on short-term investments and other noninterest income and the related change in the liability to employees under the plan is recorded in salaries expense on the consolidated statements of income.
NOTE 18 - INCOME TAXES AND TAX-RELATED ITEMS The provision for income taxes is calculated as the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Income taxes due for the current year is computed by applying federal and state tax statutes to current year taxable income. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Tax-related interest and penalties and foreign taxes are then added to the tax provision.
F-96 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The current and deferred components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (in millions) December 31 2016 2015 2014 Current: Federal $ 224 $ 275 $ 127 Foreign 5 5 6 State and local 15 20 14 Total current 244 300 147 Deferred: Federal (49 ) (68 ) 123 State and local (2 ) (3 ) 7 Total deferred (51 ) (71 ) 130 Total $ 193 $ 229 $ 277 Income before income taxes of $670 million for the year ended December31, 2016 included $18 million of foreign-source income.
The income tax provision on securities transactions for the years ended December31, 2016 and 2015 were benefits of $2 million and $1 million , respectively. There was no tax provision on securities transactions for the year ended December31, 2014 .
The provision for income taxes does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available-for-sale or the change in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The income tax effects of transactions under the Corporation's share-based compensation plans reduced both shareholders equity and deferred tax assets by $9 million , $12 million and $11 million in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 respectively.
A reconciliation of expected income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the Corporations provision for income taxes and effective tax rate follows: (dollar amounts in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Years Ended December 31 Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate Tax based on federal statutory rate $ 235 35.0 % $ 262 35.0 % $ 305 35.0 % State income taxes 8 1.2 10 1.3 13 1.5 Affordable housing and historic credits (22 ) (3.3 ) (22 ) (2.9 ) (24 ) (2.8 ) Bank-owned life insurance (15 ) (2.3 ) (15 ) (2.0 ) (15 ) (1.7 ) Other changes in unrecognized tax benefits     2 0.2 Lease termination transactions (15 ) (2.2 ) (5 ) (0.7 )   Tax-related interest and penalties 3 0.5 1 0.1 (3 ) (0.3 ) Other (1 ) (0.1 ) (2 ) (0.3 ) (1 ) (0.1 ) Provision for income taxes $ 193 28.8 % $ 229 30.5 % $ 277 31.8 % The liability for tax-related interest and penalties included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was $7 million and $3 million at December31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into certain transactions that have tax consequences. From time to time, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may review and/or challenge specific interpretive tax positions taken by the Corporation with respect to those transactions. The Corporation believes that its tax returns were filed based upon applicable statutes, regulations and case law in effect at the time of the transactions. The IRS, an administrative authority or a court, if presented with the transactions, could disagree with the Corporations interpretation of the tax law.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of net unrecognized tax benefits follows: (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Balance at January 1 $ 22 $ 14 $ 11 Increases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period  8 3 Decrease related to settlements with tax authorities (7 )   Balance at December 31 $ 15 $ 22 $ 14 F-97 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries The Corporation anticipates that it is reasonably possible that settlements with tax authorities will result in an $8 million decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
After consideration of the effect of the federal tax benefit available on unrecognized state tax benefits, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Corporations effective tax rate was approximately $4 million at  both December31, 2016 and December31, 2015 .
The following tax years for significant jurisdictions remain subject to examination as of December31, 2016 : Jurisdiction Tax Years Federal 2013-2015 California 2004-2015 Based on current knowledge and probability assessment of various potential outcomes, the Corporation believes that current tax reserves are adequate, and the amount of any potential incremental liability arising is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary.
The principal components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (in millions) December 31 2016 2015 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 256 $ 223 Deferred compensation 91 113 Deferred loan origination fees and costs 20 24 Net unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale 20  Other temporary differences, net 76 69 Total deferred tax asset before valuation allowance 463 429 Valuation allowance (3 ) (3 ) Total deferred tax assets 460 426 Deferred tax liabilities: Lease financing transactions (150 ) (183 ) Defined benefit plans (82 ) (32 ) Net unrealized gains on investment securities available-for-sale  (5 ) Allowance for depreciation (11 ) (7 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (243 ) (227 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 217 $ 199 Deferred tax assets included state net operating loss carryforwards of $4 million at December31, 2016 and $5 million at December31, 2015 . The carryforwards expire between 2017 and 2026 . The Corporation believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain of these state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized and, accordingly, maintained a valuation allowance of $3 million at both December31, 2016 and December31, 2015 . The determination regarding valuation allowances was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events. For further information on the Corporations valuation policy for deferred tax assets, refer to Note 1 .
NOTE 19 - TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES The Corporations banking subsidiaries had, and expect to have in the future, transactions with the Corporations directors and executive officers, companies with which these individuals are associated, and certain related individuals. Such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business and included extensions of credit, leases and professional services. With respect to extensions of credit, all were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with other customers and did not, in managements opinion, involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. The aggregate amount of loans attributable to persons who were related parties at December31, 2016 , totaled $121 million at the beginning of 2016 and $108 million at the end of 2016 . During 2016 , new loans to related parties aggregated $579 million and repayments totaled $592 million .
F-98 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 20 - REGULATORY CAPITAL AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS Reserves required to be maintained and/or deposited with the FRB are classified in interest-bearing deposits with banks. These reserve balances vary, depending on the level of customer deposits in the Corporations banking subsidiaries. The average required reserve balances were $518 million and $473 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Banking regulations limit the transfer of assets in the form of dividends, loans or advances from the bank subsidiaries to the parent company. Under the most restrictive of these regulations, the aggregate amount of dividends which can be paid to the parent company, with prior approval from bank regulatory agencies, approximated $142 million at January1, 2017 , plus 2017 net profits. Substantially all the assets of the Corporations banking subsidiaries are restricted from transfer to the parent company of the Corporation in the form of loans or advances.
The Corporations subsidiary banks declared dividends of $545 million , $437 million and $380 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
The Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. The U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (Basel III) became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015. Basel III sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), a standardized approach and an advanced approach. The Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to the standardized approach under the rules. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors.
Under Basel III, there are three categories of risk-based capital: CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders' equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. The required amount of the capital conservation buffer is being phased in beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and ultimately increasing to 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital (as defined in the regulations) to average and/or risk-weighted assets. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporations financial statements. At December31, 2016 and 2015 , the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered well capitalized For U.S. banking subsidiaries, those requirements were total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, CET1 risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than 10 percent , 8 percent , 6.5 percent and 5 percent , respectively, at December31, 2016 and 2015 . For the Corporation, requirements to be considered "well capitalized" were total risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios greater than 10 percent and 6 percent , respectively, at December31, 2016 and 2015 . There have been no conditions or events since December31, 2016 that management believes have changed the capital adequacy classification of the Corporation or its U.S. banking subsidiaries.

Masters Group v. Comerica Bank (the case), for lender liability. The case was tried in January 2014, in the Montana Second District Judicial Court for Silver Bow County in Butte, Montana. On January17, 2014 , a jury awarded Masters $52 million against the Bank. On July 1, 2015, after an appeal filed by the Corporation, the Montana Supreme Court reversed the judgment against the Corporation and remanded the case for a new trial with instructions that Michigan contract law should apply and dismissing all other claims. The case was retried in the same district court, without a jury, in January 2017. A ruling is not expected for several months. Management believes that current reserves related to this case are adequate in the event of a negative outcome.
The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various other pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations. The Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its other currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with respect to such legal proceedings, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to managements judgment as to what is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. Settlement may result from the Corporation's determination that it may be more prudent financially to settle, rather than litigate, and should not be regarded as an admission of liability. On at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation assesses its potential liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. On a case-by-case basis, reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred either as a result of a settlement or judgment, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. Based on current knowledge, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that current reserves are adequate, and the amount of any incremental liability arising from these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows. Legal fees of $19million , $21 million and $24 million for the years ended December31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were included in "other noninterest expenses" on the consolidated statements of income.
For matters where a loss is not probable, the Corporation has not established legal reserves. The Corporation believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for all legal proceedings in which it is involved is from zero to approximately $31 million at December31, 2016 . This estimated aggregate range of reasonably F-100 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Corporation is involved, taking into account the Corporations best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Corporation does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Corporations estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in certain proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Corporation) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Corporations estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate.
In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Corporation's consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows.
For information regarding income tax contingencies, refer to Note 18 .
NOTE 22 - RESTRUCTURING CHARGES The Corporation approved and launched an initiative in the second quarter 2016 designed to reduce overhead and increase revenue (the GEAR Up initiative). The actions in the initiative include, but are not limited to, a reduction in workforce, a new retirement program, streamlining operational processes, real estate optimization including consolidating 38 banking centers as well as reducing office and operations space, selective outsourcing of technology functions and reduction of technology system applications. See Note 17 for further information concerning the Corporation's retirement benefit plans.
Certain actions associated with the GEAR Up initiative result in restructuring charges. Generally, costs associated with or incurred to generate revenue as part of the initiative are recorded according to the nature of the cost and are not included in restructuring charges. The Corporation considers the following costs associated with the initiative to be restructuring charges:  Employee costs: Primarily severance costs in accordance with the Corporations severance plan.
Facilities costs: Costs pertaining to consolidating banking centers and other facilities, such as lease termination costs and decommissioning costs. Also includes accelerated depreciation and impairment of owned property to be sold.
Technology costs: Impairment and other costs associated with optimizing technology infrastructure and reducing the number of applications.
Other costs: Includes primarily professional fees, as well as other contract termination fees and legal fees incurred in the execution of the initiative.
Restructuring charges are recorded as a component of noninterest expenses on the consolidated statements of income. The following table presents changes in restructuring reserves, cumulative charges incurred to date and total expected restructuring charges: (in millions) Employee Costs Facilities Costs Technology Costs Other Costs Total Year Ended December 31, 2016 Balance at beginning of period $  $  $  $  $  Restructuring charges 52 15  26 93 Payments (44 ) (6 )  (22 ) (72 ) Adjustments for non-cash charges (a) 2 (5 )   (3 ) Balance at end of period $ 10 $ 4 $  $ 4 $ 18 Total restructuring charges incurred to date $ 52 $ 15 $  $ 26 $ 93 Total expected restructuring charges (b) 55 35 $15 - $35 35 $140 - $160 (a) Adjustments for non-cash charges include the benefit from forfeitures of nonvested stock compensation in Employee Costs and accelerated depreciation expense in Facilities Costs.
(b) Restructuring activities are expected to be substantially completed by 12/31/2018 .
Restructuring charges directly attributable to a business segment are assigned to that business segment. Restructuring charges incurred by areas whose services support the overall Corporation are allocated based on the methodology described in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. Total restructuring charges assigned to the Business Bank, Retail Bank and Wealth Management were $43 million , $38 million and $12 million , respectively, for the year ended December31, 2016 . Remaining expected restructuring charges will be assigned to the business segments using the same methodology. Facilities costs pertaining to the consolidation of banking centers are expected to impact primarily the Retail Bank.
F-101 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries NOTE 23 - BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and WealthManagement. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. Business segment results are produced by the Corporations internal management accounting system. This system measures financial results based on the internal business unit structure of the Corporation. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each business segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. From time to time, the Corporation may make reclassifications among the segments to more appropriately reflect management's current view of the segments, and methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on business unit structure and methodologies in effect at December31, 2016 .
Net interest income for each business segment is the total of interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits and charges.The FTP methodology provides the business segments credits for deposits and other funds provided and charges the business segments for loans and other assets utilizing funds.This credit or charge is based on matching stated or implied maturities for these assets and liabilities. The FTP credit provided for deposits reflects the long-term value of deposits generated based on their implied maturity. The FTP charge for funding assets reflects a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and term characteristics of the assets. For acquired loans and deposits, matched maturity funding is determined based on origination date.Accordingly, the FTP process reflects the transfer of interest rate risk exposures to the Treasury group within the Finance segment, where such exposures are centrally managed. Effective January 1, 2016, in conjunction with the effective date for regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements, the Corporation prospectively implemented an additional FTP charge, primarily for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support potential draws on unfunded loan commitments and for the long-term economic cost of holding collateral for secured deposits. The allowance for loan losses is allocated to the business segments based on the methodology used to estimate the consolidated allowance for loan losses described in Note 1. The related provision for loan losses is assigned based on the amount necessary to maintain an allowance for loan losses appropriate for each business segment. Noninterest income and expenses directly attributable to a line of business are assigned to that business segment. Direct expenses incurred by areas whose services support the overall Corporation are allocated to the business segments as follows: product processing expenditures are allocated based on standard unit costs applied to actual volume measurements; administrative expenses are allocated based on estimated time expended; and corporate overhead is assigned 50 percent based on the ratio of the business segments noninterest expenses to total noninterest expenses incurred by all business segments and 50 percent based on the ratio of the business segments attributed equity to total attributed equity of all business segments. Equity is attributed based on credit, operational and interest rate risks. Most of the equity attributed relates to credit risk, which is determined based on the credit score and expected remaining life of each loan, letter of credit and unused commitment recorded in the business segments. Operational risk is allocated based on loans and letters of credit, deposit balances, non-earning assets, trust assets under management, certain noninterest income items, and the nature and extent of expenses incurred by business units. Virtually all interest rate risk is assigned to Finance, as are the Corporations hedging activities.
Effective January 1, 2015, changes to the terms of card program contract resulted in a change to the presentation of the related revenue and expenses. In 2015, under the current contract, total revenue before related expenses was recorded in noninterest income, and related expenses were recorded in noninterest expense; whereas in 2014, under the terms of the prior contract, revenue was recorded in noninterest income net of the related expenses. The effect of this change was an increase of $177 million to both noninterest income and noninterest expenses in the Business Bank and Other Markets in 2016 .
The following discussion provides information about the activities of each business segment. A discussion of the financial results and the factors impacting 2016 performance can be found in the section entitled "Business Segments" in the financial review.
The Business Bank meets the needs of middle market businesses, multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services, including commercial loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services and loan syndication services.
The Retail Bank includes small business banking and personal financial services, consisting of consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering and mortgage loan origination. In addition to a full range of financial services provided to small F-102 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries business customers, this business segment offers a variety of consumer products, including deposit accounts, installment loans, credit cards, student loans, home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage loans.
WealthManagement offers products and services consisting of fiduciary services, private banking, retirement services, investment management and advisory services, investment banking and brokerage services. This business segment also offers the sale of annuity products, as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance products.
The Finance segment includes the Corporations securities portfolio and asset and liability management activities. This segment is responsible for managing the Corporations funding, liquidity and capital needs, performing interest sensitivity analysis and executing various strategies to manage the Corporations exposure to liquidity, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
The Other category includes the income and expense impact of equity and cash, tax benefits not assigned to specific business segments, charges of an unusual or infrequent nature that are not reflective of the normal operations of the business segments and miscellaneous other expenses of a corporate nature.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts which of necessity are based on managements best estimates and judgments and give due consideration to materiality. The other financial information herein is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.
In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the consolidated financial statements, management develops and maintains effective internal controls, including those over financial reporting, as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Corporations internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Corporations assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Management assessed, with participation of the Corporations Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the Corporations consolidated financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as of December31, 2016 . The assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on this assessment, management determined that internal control over financial reporting is effective as it relates to the Corporations consolidated financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as of December31, 2016 .
Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report.
The Corporations Board of Directors oversees managements internal control over financial reporting and financial reporting responsibilities through its Audit Committee as well as various other committees.

Comerica Incorporated and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Comerica Incorporated and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria .
