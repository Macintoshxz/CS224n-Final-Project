Through this strategy and our varied product and service mix, one customer may utilize the offerings of several of our reportable segments.
The following description of our business is based upon our reportable segments as reported in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are located in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K. Eight of our ten operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Global Energy . Our two operating segments that are primarily fee-for-service have been combined into Other, and do not meet the quantitative criteria to be separately reported. We provide similar information for Other as compared to our three reportable segments as we consider the information regarding its two underlying operating segments as useful in understanding our consolidated results.

Textile Care Textile Care provides products and services that manage the entire wash process through custom designed programs, premium products, dispensing equipment, water and energy management, and real time data management for large scale, complex commercial laundry operations including uniform rental, hospitality, linen rental and healthcare laundries. Textile Cares programs are designed to meet our customers needs for exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of linen and reducing our customers overall operating costs. Products and programs are marketed primarily through field sales employees and, to a lesser extent, through distributors.
We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers world-wide in the laundry markets in which we compete.
Global Institutional This reportable segment consists of the Institutional, Specialty and Healthcare operating segments, which provide specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government, education and retail industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics. Descriptions of the three operating segments which comprise our Global Institutional reportable segment follow below.
Institutional Institutional sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (warewashing), plus specialized cleaners for various applications throughout food service operations; for on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and healthcare customers); and for general housekeeping functions, as well as food safety products and equipment, water filters, dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries. Institutional also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers, as well as a broad range of janitorial cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality, healthcare and commercial facilities. Institutional develops various chemical dispensing systems which are used by our customers to efficiently and safely dispense our cleaners and sanitizers.In addition, Institutional markets a lease program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance. Through our EcoSure Food Safety Management business, Institutional also provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations.
Institutional sells its products and programs primarily through its field sales and corporate account sales personnel. Corporate account sales personnel establish relationships and negotiate contracts with larger multi-unit or chain customers. We also utilize independent, third-party foodservice, broad-line and janitorial distributors to provide logistics to end customers for accounts that prefer to purchase through these distributors. Many of these distributors also participate in marketing our product and service offerings to the end customers. Through our field sales personnel, we generally provide the same customer support to end-use customers supplied by these distributors as we do to direct customers.
We believe that we are one of the leading global supplier of warewashing and laundry products and programs to the food service, hospitality and lodging markets.
Specialty Specialty supplies cleaning and sanitizing chemical products and related items primarily to regional, national and international quick service restaurant (QSR) chains and food retailers (i.e., supermarkets and grocery stores). Its products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools and equipment which are primarily sold under the Kay and Ecolab brand names. Specialtys cleaning and sanitation programs are customized to meet the needs of the market segments it serves and are designed to provide highly effective cleaning performance, promote food safety, reduce labor costs and enhance user and guest safety. A number of dispensing options are available for products in the core product range. Specialty supports its product sales with training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers.
5 Table of Contents Both Specialtys QSR business and its food retail business utilize a corporate account sales force which manages relationships with customers at the corporate headquarters and regional office levels (and, in the QSR market segment, at the franchisee level) and a field sales force which provides program support at the individual restaurant or store level. QSR customers are primarily supplied through third party distributors while most food retail customers utilize their own distribution networks. While Specialtys customer base has grown over the years, Specialtys business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of major QSR chains and franchisees and large food retail customers.
We believe that Specialty is one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global QSR market and a leading supplier of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global food retail market.
Healthcare Healthcare provides infection prevention, surgical solutions and contamination control solutions to acute care hospitals, surgery centers, medical device Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), and pharmaceutical and hospital clean room environments.

We believe Energy is one of the leading global providers of specialty chemicals to the upstream oil and gas industry, and downstream refineries and petrochemical operations.
6 Table of Contents Other Other consists of the Pest Elimination and Equipment Care operating segments. We provide pest elimination and kitchen repair and maintenance through our two operating units that are primarily fee-for-service businesses. In general, these businesses provide service which can augment or extend our product offerings to our business customers as a part of our Circle the Customer approach and, in particular, by enhancing our food safety capabilities.
Pest Elimination Pest Elimination provides services designed to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, in restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers. The services of Pest Elimination are sold and performed by field sales and service personnel.
Pest Elimination continues to expand its geographic coverage. In addition to the United States, which constitutes the largest operation, we operate in various countries in Asia Pacific, Western Europe, Latin America and South Africa, with the largest operations in France, the United Kingdom, Greater China and Mexico.
We believe Pest Elimination is a leading supplier of pest elimination programs to the commercial, hospitality and institutional markets in the geographies it serves.
Equipment Care Equipment Care provides equipment repair, maintenance and preventive maintenance services for the commercial food service industry. Repair services are offered for in-warranty repair, acting as the manufacturers authorized service agent, as well as after-warranty repair. In addition, Equipment Care operates as a parts distributor to repair service companies and end-use customers. The Equipment Care business operates solely in the United States.
We believe that Equipment Care is a leading provider of equipment maintenance and repair programs to the commercial food service industry in the United States locations in which we compete.
Additional Information International Operations We directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in some cases, through a joint venture with a local partner. In certain countries, selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues. In general, our businesses conducted outside the United States are similar to those conducted in the United States.
Our business operations outside the United States are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, international business laws and regulations, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions. The profitability of our International operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the United States, due to (i) the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions, (ii) higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions, (iii) the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size, and (iv) the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins. Proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations.
Competition In general, the markets in which the businesses in our Global Industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies, with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services. Our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value, technical expertise, chemical formulations, customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and metering equipment.
The businesses in our Global Institutional reportable segment and Other have two significant classes of competitors. First, we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-use customer segments.We compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation.
Our Global Energy reportable segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies, with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller, regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas.We compete in this business on the basis of our product quality, technical expertise, chemical formulations, effective global supply chain, strong customer service and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership.
7 Table of Contents Sales Products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation, water treatment and process chemistry needs. Independent, third-party distributors and, to a lesser extent, sales agents, are utilized in several markets, as described in the segment descriptions found above.
Number of Employees We had 47,565 employees as of December 31, 2016.
Customers and Classes of Products We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2016 consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit.
We sold one class of products within the Global Institutional segment which comprised 10% or more of consolidated net sales in two of the last three years. Sales of warewashing products were approximately 11% and 10% of consolidated net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Patents and Trademarks We own and license a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property. While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, except for the items listed below, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.
Patents related to our TRASAR and 3D TRASAR technology, which are material to our Global Industrial reportable segment. U.S. and foreign patents protect aspects of our key TRASAR and 3D TRASAR technology until at least 2024.
Trademarks related to Ecolab, Nalco and 3D TRASAR, which collectively are material to all of our reportable segments. The Ecolab, Nalco Company and 3D TRASAR trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets, and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely.
Seasonality We experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments. Part II, Item 8, Note 18, entitled Quarterly Financial Data of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.
Investments in Equipment We have no unusual working capital requirements. We have invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in process control and monitoring equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems.The investment in such equipment is discussed under the heading "Investing Activities" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
Manufacturing and Distribution We manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-operated manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for us by third-party contract manufacturers. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. Properties, of this Form 10-K.
Deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and third-party logistics service providers. We use common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors for transport. Additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. Properties, of this Form 10-K.
Raw Materials Raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including alkalis, acids, biocides, phosphonates, phosphorous materials, silicates and salts; and organic chemicals, including acids, alcohols, amines, fatty acids, surfactants, solvents, monomers and polymers. Healthcare purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets. Pesticides used by Pest Elimination are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. We purchase more than 10,000 raw materials, with the largest single raw material representing less than 2% of raw material purchases. Our raw materials, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we 8 Table of Contents manufacture, are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally. When practical, global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels.
Research and Development Our research and development program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging engineering, remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel. At times, technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings.
We believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers.
Part II, Item 8, Note 14, entitled Research and Development Expenditures of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.
Joint Ventures Over time, we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements, to achieve quicker operational scale, to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers. During 2016, the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures, in the aggregate, was less than three percent. The table below identifies our most significant consolidated and non-consolidated joint ventures, summarized by the primary purpose of the joint venture.

We will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic, technological and product reach.
9 Table of Contents Environmental and Regulatory Considerations Our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Similarly, the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations, including among others, air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production (including those related to hydraulic fracturing), could impact the sales of some of our products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products.
Additionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below.
Ingredient Legislation : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment.Under California Proposition 65, for example, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. Chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states, including California, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and South Carolina. Environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date, and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures. Cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress in each of the past few years but has not passed, and several states are considering further regulations in this area. The California Safer Consumer Products Act regulations became effective in 2013 and focus on ingredients in consumer products that have the potential for widespread public exposure. The U.S. Government is monitoring green chemistry initiatives through a variety of initiatives, including its Design for the Environment (DfE)/Safer Choice program. DfE/Safer Choice has three broad areas of work (recognition of safer products on a DfE/Safer Choice label, development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals), and we are involved in these to varying degrees. Our Global Institutional and Global Industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stay-in-market expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to date.
TSCA : The nations primary chemicals management law, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (LCSA) in 2016. The LCSA modernizes the original 1976 legislation, aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce, improve the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) EPAs capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances, and prevent further state action or more other notification programs like REACH (see below).For Ecolab, the new TSCA rules will mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the United States.In addition, the EPA likely will be more aggressively using the existing TSCA tools to manage chemicals of concern. We anticipate that compliance with new requirements under TSCA could be similar to the costs associated with REACH in the European Union, which is discussed below.
REACH : The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH). It established a new European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe. We met the pre-registration requirements of REACH, the 2010 and 2013 registration deadlines, and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2018. To help manage this program, we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements. In addition, Korea, Taiwan and other countries are planning similar requirements. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable, but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.
GHS : In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). GHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets (SDSs). Most countries in which we operate will adopt GHS-related legislation, and numerous countries already have done so. The primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels. We met the 2015 deadlines in the U.S. and European Union and are working toward a phased-in approach to mitigate the costs of GHS implementation in other countries (e.g., June 2017 is the final deadline for Canada and Australia). Potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.
10 Table of Contents Pesticide and Biocide Legislation : Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such products constitute pesticides or antimicrobial pesticides under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain several hundred product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position.
In Europe, the Biocidal Product Directive and the more recent Biocidal Products Regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products. We are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances. Anticipated registration costs, which will be incurred through the multi-year phase-in period, will be significant; however, these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position.
In addition, Pest Elimination applies restricted-use pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties. That business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements.
FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. FDA regulations associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Medical Device and Drug Product Requirements : As a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs, we also are subject to regulation by the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state, local and foreign governments in which we sell our products. These regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products.We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device and drug manufacturer, comply with post-market reporting (e.g., Adverse Event Reporting, MDR and Recall) requirements, and to comply with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices and Quality System Regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the United States and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing, testing and control activities. Countries in the European Union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a CE mark, an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards, and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements (e.g., Medical Device Directive 93/42/EE and ISO 13485). We have CE mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in Europe. Our other international non-European operations also are subject to government regulation and country-specific rules and regulations. Regulators at the federal, state and local level have imposed, are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products. No prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations, and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products.
Equipment: Ecolabs products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements, as well as being subject to UL, NSF, and other approval requirements. We have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and third-party production of our equipment. We are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Other Environmental Legislation : Capital Expenditures: Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air, land and water. The products we produce and distribute into Europe are also subject to 11 Table of Contents directives governing electrical waste (WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU) and restrictive substances (RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU). Similar legal requirements apply to Ecolabs facilities globally. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $60 million in 2016 and $55 million in 2015. Approximately $90 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2017. The increase in 2017 over 2016 is due to continued spending on process safety and compliance matters throughout the Company, including facilities acquired in connection with the Champion transaction.
Climate Change : Various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels, particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. None of these laws and regulations directly apply to Ecolab at the present time; however, as a matter of corporate policy, we support a balanced approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth. We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and have made significant strides in recent years. In 2014, we received a Climate Leadership Award, co-sponsored by EPA, recognizing Ecolab for achieving an absolute global greenhouse gas emissions reduction of more than 12.5 percent (22.4 percent intensity reduction).
Our current global sustainability targets were established in 2016. They include a 25 percent reduction in water withdrawals and a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. In addition to our internal sustainability performance, we partner with customers at more than 1.0 million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through our high-efficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation, water, paper and energy services. We also introduced a customer impact goal for the first time. By partnering with our customers to help them do more with less through the use of our solutions, we aim to conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030.
Environmental Remediation and Proceedings : Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (PRP), we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or state equivalents at 24 sites in the United States. Additionally, we have similar liability at six sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP that actually contributed hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.
Based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.
As previously reported, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a Notice of Enforcement and Notice of Violation related to Ecolabs facility in Fresno, TX on August 29, 2014, alleging violations of the facilitys air permits and various state and federal air laws. On June 24, 2015, the TCEQ issued a draft consent decree to Ecolab for certain violations, with the TCEQ ultimately seeking an administrative penalty of approximately $850,000. The company signed an Agreed Order with the TCEQ on May 2, 2016 to pay this penalty, which is subject to approval by the TCEQ, and simultaneously paid the first installment of approximately $425,000.The final installment will be paid upon approval of the Agreed Order by the TCEQ.
We have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries, but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future, and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures. In each of these chemical exposure cases, our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf (with or without reservation) and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible; however, we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance.
We have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances, including multi-party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services. While we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information, there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $9.0 million in 2016 and $6.5 million in 2015. Our worldwide accruals at December 31, 2016 for probable future remediation expenditures, excluding potential insurance reimbursements, totaled approximately $22 million. We review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
12 Table of Contents Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders.Disclosure is required even where the activities are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and even if the activities are not covered or prohibited by U.S. law.After the easing of certain sanctions by the United States against Iran in January 2016 and in compliance with the economic sanctions regulations administered by U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and U.S. export control laws, a wholly-owned non-U.S. subsidiary of the Company completed the following sales related to businesses in our Energy operating segment pursuant to and in compliance with the terms and conditions of OFACs General License H: sales of products used for process and water treatment applications in (i) upstream oil and gas production and (ii) petrochemical plants totaling $535,000 during the subsidiarys fiscal year ended November 30, 2016, and additional sales of such products totaling $571,000 during December 2016, were made to a distributor in Dubai and two distributors in Iran. The net profit before taxes associated with these sales is estimated to be $117,180 and $351,192, respectively. Our non-U.S. subsidiary intends to continue doing business in Iran under General License H in compliance with U.S. economic sanctions and export control laws, which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to the abovementioned statute.

These statements, which represent the Companys expectations or beliefs concerning various future events, are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those of such forward-looking statements. We caution that undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. For a further discussion of these and other factors which could cause results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K, entitled Risk Factors. Except as may be required under applicable law, we undertake no duty to update our forward-looking statements.
Item 1A. Risk Factors .
The following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. See the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements set forth above.
We may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forward-looking statements including those made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public.
Our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve.
Economic downturns, and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the energy, foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, pulp and paper, mining and steel industries, can adversely impact our end-users.
The well completion and stimulation, oil and gas production and refinery and petrochemical plant markets served by our Global Energy segment may be impacted by substantial fluctuations in oil and gas prices; in 2015 and 2016, the Global Energy segment experienced decreased sales as a result of very challenging global energy market conditions. In recent years, the weaker global economic environment, particularly in Europe and emerging markets such as China and Brazil, has also negatively impacted many of our end-markets. Weaker economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets.
During such cycles, these end-users may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business.
Our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors.
Economic factors such as the worldwide economy, capital flows, interest rates and currency movements, including, in particular, our exposure to foreign currency risk, have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impacton our business in the future.In 2008 and 2009, the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility, and the disruption was particularly acutein the global credit markets.In 2011 and 2012, the European Unions sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the U.S. dollar.Additionally, the June 2016 Brexit voteresulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the possibility for referendum by other EU member states may lead to further market volatility.Other regions of the world, including emerging market areas, also expose us to foreign currency risk. As a result of increasing currency controls, importation restrictions, workforce regulations, pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior to deconsolidation, across the second through fourth quarters of 2015, we devalued our Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and Energy operating segments. Similar currency devaluations, credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity, including in our key end-markets, and by further weakening the local currency versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations, which are generated in the local currency, and then translated to U.S. dollars.
We depend on key personnel to lead our business.
Our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees, particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities. This is especially crucial as we continue the integration of new businesses, which may be led by personnel that we believe are critical to the success of the integration and the prospects of the business. Our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract or retain such officers or key employees.
If we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives, our business could be adversely affected .
We continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns. In particular, we continue to invest in our information technology systems to integrate and streamline our processes and to improve our competitiveness. These initiatives involve complex business process 15 Table of Contents design and a breakdown in certain of these processes could result in business disruption. Additionally, we may undertake in the future business manufacturing initiatives similar to the substantially completed Energy Restructuring Plan and Combined Restructuring Plan discussed under Note 3, entitled Special Gains and Charges of this Form 10-K. If the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.
We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.
We rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. The size and complexity of our information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Recent acquisitions, including the Nalco and Champion transactions, have resulted in further de-centralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage, business disruption and legal and regulatory costs; could result in third-party claims; could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property, trade secrets and sensitive information; or could otherwise adversely affect our business.
Our significant non-U.S. operations expose us to global economic, political and legal risks that could impact our profitability.
We have significant operations outside the United States, including jointventures and other alliances.We conduct business in approximately170countries and, in 2016, approximately47%of our net sales originatedoutside the United States.There are inherent risks in our international operations, including:  exchange controls and currency restrictions;  currency fluctuations and devaluations;  tariffs and trade barriers;  export duties and quotas;  changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials, energy and utilities;  changes in local economic conditions;  changes in laws and regulations, including the imposition of economic or trade sanctions affecting international commercial transactions;  impact from Brexit and the possibility of similar events in other EU member states;  difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with foreign laws;  requirements to include local ownership or management in our business;  economic and business objectives that differ from those of our joint venture partners;  exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization or other government actions;  restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries;  unsettled political conditions, military action, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict; and  countries whose governments have been hostile to U.S.-based businesses.
Also, because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights, we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments. We are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty, which has impacted our business in some countries. Other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors.
Further, our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, as well as U.S. and international economic sanctions regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations;however, there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the Company, significant fines and sanctions, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social, legal and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations .
Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards, and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally, including employment and labor laws.Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability andincreases our operating costs. Regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards, causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs.The potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws 16 Table of Contents and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations, and the timing and expense of compliance.Changes to current laws (including tax laws), regulations and policies could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
We are a defendant in several wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or a similar state law, certain of which have either been certified for class treatment or are seeking such certification.While one of the lawsuits has been tentatively settled, there can be no assurance that pending or future wage hour lawsuits can be successfully defended or settled.
Our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our COREXIT dispersant in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs.
Our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our COREXIT dispersant in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs. On April 22, 2010, the deepwater drilling platform, the Deepwater Horizon, operated by a subsidiary of BP plc, sank in the Gulf of Mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on April 20, 2010. A massive oil spill resulted. Approximately one week following the incident, subsidiaries of BP plc, under the authorization of the responding federal agencies, formally requested our indirect subsidiary, Nalco Company, to supply large quantities of COREXIT 9500, a Nalco oil dispersant product listed on the U.S. EPA National Contingency Plan Product Schedule. Nalco Company responded immediately by providing available COREXIT and increasing production to supply the product to BPs subsidiaries for use, as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government.
Nalco Company and certain affiliates (collectively Nalco) were named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event. The plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability, tort and other theories.Nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters.Nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants.
All but one of these cases have been administratively transferred to a judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana with other related cases under In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 20, 2010, Case No. 10-md-02179 (E.D. La.) (the MDL). The remaining case was Franks v. Sea Tow of South Miss, Inc., et al, Cause No. A2402-10-228 (Circuit Court of Harrison County Mississippi). The Franks case was dismissed in May 2014.
Nalco Company, the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as third party defendants by Transocean Deepwater Drilling, Inc. and its affiliates (the Transocean Entities) (In re the Complaint and Petition of Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, et al, MDL No. 2179, Civil Action 10-2771). In April and May 2011, the Transocean Entities, Cameron International Corporation, Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., M-I L.L.C., Weatherford U.S., L.P. and Weatherford International, Inc. (collectively, the Cross Claimants) filed cross claims in MDL 2179 against Nalco Company and other unaffiliated cross defendants. The Cross Claimants generally allege, among other things, that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon explosion, oil spill and/or spill response, they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants.
On November 28, 2012, the Federal Court in the MDL entered an order dismissing all claims against Nalco. Because claims remain pending against other defendants, the Courts decision is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal. Plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the Courts decision. We cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal, the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation. However, if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won, these suits could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In May 2016, Nalco was named in nine additional complaints filed by individuals alleging, among other things, business and economic loss resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.The plaintiffs in these lawsuits are generally seeking awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees and costs.These actions have been consolidated in the MDL and we expect they will be dismissed pursuant to the Courts November 28, 2012 order granting Nalcos motion for summary judgment.
Nalco continues to sell the COREXIT oil dispersant product and could be exposed to future lawsuits from the use of such product. We cannot predict the potential for future litigation with respect to such sales. However, if one or more of such lawsuits are brought and won, these suits could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
Our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value, innovation and customer support .
Our competitive market is made up of numerous global, national, regional and local competitors. Our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize innovative, high value-added products for niche applications. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future. In addition, certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets. If we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis, we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.
17 Table of Contents Our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials .
The prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time, and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs. Changes in raw material prices, unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows . In addition, volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our business.
Consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results.
Customers and vendors in the foodservice, hospitality, travel, healthcare, energy, food processing and pulp and paper industries, as well as other industries we serve, have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue. This consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations.
We have substantial indebtedness which will impact our financial flexibility.
As of December 31, 2016, we had net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) of $6.4 billion. Our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business, consolidated results of operations and financial position, including in the following respects:  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to debt service obligations, thereby potentially reducing the availability of cash flows to pay cash dividends and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general operating requirements and opportunities;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service obligations and other general operating requirements;  placing us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;  limiting flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate, which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations; and  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions.
In addition, as of December 31, 2016 approximately $1.5 billion of our debt is floating rate debt. A one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approximately $11 million per year. Accordingly, a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify.
We enter into multi-year contracts with customers that can impact our results.
Our multi-year contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations.
If we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions, our business could be adversely affected .
As part of our long-term strategy, we seek to acquire complementary businesses. There can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses.If the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates, the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.
Future events may impact our deferred tax position, including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases), to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial 18 Table of Contents position. Further, should the Company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, a deferred tax liability may need to be established.
Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.
We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the United States, including potential reforms under the President Trump administration, and elsewhere, such as interpretations as to the legality of tax advantages granted under the European Union state aid rules.We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
Severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business.
Our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic. The United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, public health outbreaks such as Zika virus, Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1 influenza.A prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets.Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business.
We incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the Nalco and Champion transactions and other acquisitions.
Ecolab expects to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future. In connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions, applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring Company at their fair values. Intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant. Any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring Company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill. If it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business, the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired. In this case, the acquiring Company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment. This write-down of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a non-cash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring Company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs. As of December 31, 2016, we had goodwill of $6.4 billion which is maintained in various reporting units, including goodwill from theNalcoandChampiontransactions. If we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the Nalco and Champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired, we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment. Impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
A chemical spill or release could adversely impact our business .
As a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products, there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled, released or discharged, either in liquid or gaseous form, during production, transportation, storage or use. Such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard. Accordingly, such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Extraordinary events may significantly impact our business.
The occurrence of (a) litigation or claims, (b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c) war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets), (d) natural or manmade disasters, (e) water shortages or (f) severe weather conditions affecting the energy, foodservice, hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.
Defense of litigation, particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust, patent infringement, wage hour and class action lawsuits, can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful, and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
While we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods.
War (including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or manmade disasters, water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy, foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, pulp and paper, mining, steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

23 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .
The following management discussion and analysis (MD&A) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.
We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance .
The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this MD&A, and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K.
Comparability of Results Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at the Marginal Currency System (SIMADI) rate at year end 2015 of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. Public currency rate data provided within the Segment Performance section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period, and is provided for informational purposes only.
Venezuela Related Activities Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Prior to deconsolidation, due to the countrys highly inflationary economy, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar. As a result, currency remeasurement adjustments for non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings. Across the second through fourth quarters of 2015, the Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and Energy operating segments were converted from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As noted above, within our fixed currency sales and operating results, to present our historical Venezuelan bolivar operations at a consistent conversion rate, we have reflected all Venezuelan bolivar results for the 2015 and 2014 reporting years at a SIMADI conversion rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar.
Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We continued to work aggressively through 2016's difficult environment, where lacklusterglobal economies, significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued depressed energy market activity presented multiple headwinds to our growth. We once again delivered superior results for customers at the lowest total operating cost to them, while also working aggressively to deliver margin improvement. We also continued to make significant investments in our customer, field and infrastructure technology as well as in our talent management systems, all key areas that will be critical to our long-term success.
In this environment, our Global Institutional, Global Industrial and Other segments continued to show good fixed currency sales and earnings results. However, these were offset by a decline in the Global Energy segment, coupled with significantly unfavorable currency translation due to the strong dollar appreciation relative to other currencies. We worked aggressively to offset these headwinds, while making progress in our work to strengthen our businesses and position them for better growth in 2017.
24 Table of Contents Sales Reported sales declined 3% to $13.2 billion in 2016 from $13.5 billion in 2015. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales were flat compared to the prior year. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the Net Sales table on page30 and the Sales by Reportable Segment table on page36 for reconciliation information.
Gross Margin Our reported gross margin was 47.5% of sales for 2016, which compared to our 2015 reported gross margin of 46.7%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2016 and 2015, our adjusted gross margin was 48.0% in 2016 and 47.3% in 2015. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin table on page30 for reconciliation information .
Operating Income Reported operating income increased 23% to $1.9 billion in 2016, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, decreased 2% in 2016. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3%. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the Operating Income table on page34 and Operating Income by Reportable Segment table on page36 for reconciliation information .
Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (EPS) Reported diluted EPS increased 25% to $4.14 in 2016 compared to $3.32 in 2015. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years, driven primarily by Energy related charges in 2016 and Venezuelan related actions, restructuring charges and other gains and charges in both 2016 and 2015. Also in 2015, special (gains) and charges included acquisition and integration related costs that were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items from both 2016 and 2015 were flat at $4.37 in both 2016 and 2015. See the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the Diluted EPS table on page35 for reconciliation information .
Balance Sheet We remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/Baa1 by the major ratings agencies, and to achieving A range ratings metrics. We believe that our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.
Net Debt to EBITDA Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was 2.3 and 2.6 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA, was 2.2 for both 2016 and 2015. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. Se e the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the Net Debt to EBITDA table on page 40 for reconciliation information.
Cash Flow Cash flow from operating activities was $1.9 billion in 2016 compared to $2.0 billion in 2015. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. See the section entitled Cash Flows within this MD&A for further information.
Dividends We increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in December2016 to an indicated annual rate of $1.48 per share. The increase represents our 25th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 80th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes).
25 Table of Contents Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1)the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2)different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
Besides estimates that meet the critical estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following : Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists, title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on services as they are performed. While we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers needs are best met in a high quality way, the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales. Our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in Note 17.
Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts, as discussed below. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive .
Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. In addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. We estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $68 million and $75 million, as of December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $14 million and $15 million as of December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.2% in 2016, 2015 and 2014. We believe that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required .
For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 2.
Accrued Liabilities Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. As with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.
We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position.
For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 15 .
26 Table of Contents Actuarially Determined Liabilities Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.
The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.
The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues rated Aa by Moodys Investor Services or AA by Standard& Poors. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. For 2015 and 2014, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The change in approach did not affect the measurement of our plan obligations or the funded status of our plans. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2016, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.27% from 4.51% at year-end 2015. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2016, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.14% from 4.38% at year-end 2015.
The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used for determining the 2015, 2016 and 2017 U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.75%.
Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the 2015 and 2016 U.S. pension expenses was 4.32% and for 2017 it is 4.03%. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December31, 2016, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2023 and remain at those levels thereafter.
In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2016, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2016 projection scale (applied to the RP-2006 mortality table).
The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $533 million as of December31, 2016 from $513 million as of December31, 2015 (both before tax), primarily due to current period net actuarial losses.
The effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December31, 2016, on the December31, 2016 funded status and 2017 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans : EffectonU.S.PensionPlans Increasein Higher Assumption Recorded 2017 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $ 65.7 $ 5.5 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 4.8 EffectonU.S.Postretirement HealthCareBenefitsPlans Increasein Higher Assumption Recorded 2017 (millions) Change Obligation Expense Discount rate -0.25 pts $ 5.1 $ 0.5 Expected return on assets -0.25 pts N/A 0.0 Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.
27 Table of Contents See Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations .
Self Insurance Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.
Restructuring Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets.
Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Restructuring charges were substantially completed within our two active plans (Combined and Energy) during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our restructuring liability balance was $40 million and $90 million as of December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For additional information on our current restructuring activities, see Note 3 .
Income Taxes Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.
Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. During interim periods, this expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. In the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period.
Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return, but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements.
During the first quarter of 2016 we early-adopted the accounting guidance that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, using the prospective application method. Periods prior to the first quarter of 2016 have not been retrospectively adjusted for adoption of this guidance.
28 Table of Contents U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. It is impractical to determine the amount of incremental taxes on an ongoing basis that might arise if all undistributed earnings were distributed.
Uncertain Tax Positions A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (Ecolab and Nalco) through 2012. The IRS has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns (Champion) through 2011 and tax year 2012 is closed by statute of limitations. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2013 and 2014 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. The majority of our tax reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $76 million and $75 million as of December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For additional information on income taxes and adoption of new accounting guidance related to classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, see Note 12 and Note 2, respectively .
Long-Lived Assets,Intangible Assets and Goodwill Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets We periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion as of December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over its estimated fair value.
We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.
Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent Nalco and Champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. Our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. Additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. If our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets.
In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets We had total goodwill of $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion as of December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our ten operating segments.
29 Table of Contents For our 2016 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our ten reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting units carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. Our goodwill impairment assessment for 2016 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the units carrying amount by a significant margin. We will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments. No events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016.
As part of the Nalco merger, we added the Nalco trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of December31, 2016 and 2015. The carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2016. Based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016.

Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.
Our reported gross margin was 47.5%, 46.7% and 46.2% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our 2016, 2015 and 2014 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $66.0 million, $80.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the special (gains) and charges table on page 31.
Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2016 adjusted gross margin was 48.0% compared against a 2015 adjusted gross margin of 47.3%. The increase was driven primarily by lower delivered product costs, cost efficiencies and the impact of the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower gross margin .
Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 47.3% and 46.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was due primarily to delivered product cost savings and synergies.
30 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A) (percent) 2016 2015 2014 SG&A Ratio 32.7 % 32.1 % 32.1 % The increased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2016 against 2015 was driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions, investments in the business and the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower SG&A ratio .
The consistent SG&A ratio comparing 2015 against 2014 resulted from the impact of net synergies and cost savings actions which were offset by investments in the business .
Special (Gains) and Charges Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following items: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Cost of sales Restructuring activities $ (0.4) $ 16.5 $ 13.9 Inventory costs (6.2) (14.5) - Inventory reserves - 20.6 - Energy related charges 62.6 - - Fixed asset impairment and other inventory charges 10.0 24.7 0.4 Venezuela related activities - 33.3 - Subtotal 66.0 80.6 14.3 Special (gains) and charges Restructuring activities (8.7) 83.8 69.2 Champion and Nalco integration costs - 18.7 28.4 Energy related charges 14.2 - - Venezuela related activities (7.8) 256.0 - Other 41.8 56.3 (28.8) Subtotal 39.5 414.8 68.8 Operating income subtotal 105.5 495.4 83.1 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest Restructuring activities - (1.7) - Venezuela related activities - (11.1) - Subtotal - (12.8) - Total special (gains) and charges $ 105.5 $ 482.6 $ 83.1 For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.
Restructuring Activities Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3 .
Energy Restructuring Plan In April2013, following the completion of the Champion transaction, we commenced plans to undertake restructuring and other cost-saving actions to realize our acquisition-related cost synergies as well as streamline and strengthen our position in the global energy market (the Energy Restructuring Plan). Actions associated with the acquisition to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business included a reduction of the combined businesss global workforce. Actions also included leveraging and simplifying our global supply chain, including the reduction of plant, distribution center and redundant facility locations and product line optimization.
Restructuring charges within the Energy Restructuring Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016. Cumulative restructuring charges of $89 million ($60 million after tax and net of the impact from noncontrolling interest), are materially consistent with our initial expectation of $80 million ($55 million after tax).
31 Table of Contents We recorded restructuring charges of $4.5 million ($2.6 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share, $47.2 million ($33.0 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($6.4 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of the ownership structure of certain entities holding Energy Restructuring charges, we reflected $1.7 million of the 2015 charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Net cash payments under the Energy Restructuring Plan were $14.4 million during 2016 and $42.5 million from 2013 through 2015. The majority of cash payments under this plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. We anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will be funded from operating activities.
During 2016 the Energy Restructuring Plan achieved approximately $25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015. Cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with synergies achieved in connection with the acquisition, were approximately $150 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations.
Combined Restructuring Plan In February2011, we commenced a comprehensive plan to substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European business, as well as undertake certain restructuring activities outside of Europe, historically referred to as the 2011 Restructuring Plan. Additionally, in January2012, following the merger with Nalco, we formally commenced plans to undertake restructuring actions related to the reduction of our global workforce and optimization of our supply chain and office facilities, including planned reductions of plant and distribution center locations, historically referred to as the Merger Restructuring Plan. During the first quarter of 2013, we determined that the objectives of the plans discussed above were aligned, and consequently, the previously separate restructuring plans were combined into one plan .
The combined restructuring plan (the Combined Plan) combines opportunities and initiatives from both plans and continues to follow the original format of the Merger Restructuring Plan by focusing on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities, including reductions of the global workforce, plant and distribution center locations.
Restructuring charges within the Combined Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016. Cumulative restructuring charges of $391 million ($297 million after tax), are materially consistent with our initial expectation of $400 million ($300 million after tax).
We recorded net gains of $13.6 million ($13.4 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share during 2016 primarily related to gains on the sale of certain facilities related to previous restructuring initiatives. We recorded net charges of $53.0 million ($44.2 million after tax) or $0.15 per diluted share and $73.5 million ($58.5 million after tax) or $0.19 per diluted share during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Net cash payments under the Combined Plan were $14.9 million during 2016 and $303.1 million from 2011 through 2015. The majority of cash payments under the Combined Plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. We anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will continue to be funded from operating activities.
During 2016, the Combined Plan achieved approximately $25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015. Cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with annual cost saving and synergies, were approximately $420 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations.
Non-Restructuring Special (Gains) and Charges Energy related charges Oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures, which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in North America. During the second and fourth quarters of 2016, as a result of these conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we recorded total charges of $76.8 million ($50.0 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share, comprised of inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, headcount reductions and other charges.
The inventory write-downs and related disposal costs of $40.5 million include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of certain specific-use and other products, coupled with declines in replacement costs, as well as estimated costs to dispose the respective excess inventory. The fixed asset charges of $20.4 million resulted from the write-down of certain assets related to the reduction of certain aspects of our North American operations within the Global Energy segment, as well as abandonment of certain projects under construction. The carrying value of the corresponding fixed assets was reduced to zero. The employee termination costs of $13.1 million include a reduction in our Global Energy segments global workforce to better align its workforce with anticipated activity levels in the near term. As of the end of 2016, we had $7.4 million of corresponding severance remaining to be paid, which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months and be funded from operating activities.
The charges discussed above have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
32 Table of Contents Venezuela related activities Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for the investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. We used the cost method of accounting for the investment in our Venezuelan subsidiaries throughout 2016 as the conditions within Venezuela driving this decision remained in place during 2016. Prior to deconsolidation, we remeasured our Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and the bolivar portion of our Venezuelan operations within Energy operating segments from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected a portion of the devaluation impact as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon deconsolidation, we recorded a charge to fully write off our intercompany receivables and investment. The total charges during 2015 related to our actions in Venezuela were $289.3 million ($246.8 million after tax). As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected $11.1 million of the above charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income, resulting in a net charge of $235.7 million or $0.78 per diluted share.
During 2016, we recorded a gain of $7.8 million ($4.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share resulting from U.S. dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation.
Venezuela related charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Fixed asset impairment and other inventory charges During 2015, we recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of $24.7 million ($15.4 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our U.S. plants.
The impaired facility is a specialized facility used for dry polymer production. Due to market contraction in the oil and the mining industries, and the aggressive competitive pricing environment for dry polymers, the facility has not reached production volumes to recover the value of the underlying fixed assets.
During 2016, we recorded an additional charge of $10.0 million ($6.3 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share related to the dry polymer fixed asset impairment, as well as related inventory charges. Subsequent to the charge, the remaining value of the underlying fixed assets is less than $5 million. Inventory charges include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of the corresponding dry polymer products.
These items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Inventory costs and inventory reserve During 2015, we improved and standardized estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing, resulting in a net pre-tax charge of approximately $6 million. Separately, the actions resulted in a charge of $20.6 million ($15.9 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to inventory reserve calculations, partially offset by a gain of $14.5 million ($12.2 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory. During 2016, we took additional actions related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million ($4.6 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share.
These items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Champion and Nalco integration costs Integration related special charges for the Champion acquisition and Nalco merger were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, and we did not incur any special charges related to such transactions during 2016.
As a result of the Champion acquisition and Nalco merger, we incurred charges of $18.7 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share and $28.4 million ($19.8 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share, during 2015 and 2014, respectively. Champion and Nalco integration charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Other special (gains) and charges During 2016, we recorded charges of $41.8 million ($26.4 million after tax) or $0.09 per diluted share, primarily consisting of litigation related charges.
During 2015, we recorded a net charge of $56.3 million ($34.5 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily made up of litigation related charges and the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our Ecovation business, offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the Champion transaction.
33 Table of Contents During 2014, we recorded a special gain of $28.4 million ($23.3 million after tax), or $0.08 per diluted share, as a result of a favorable licensing settlement and other settlement gains, the consolidation of the Emirates National Chemicals Company LLC (Emochem) entity and removal of the corresponding equity method investment and the disposition of a business.
The charges discussed above have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Operating Income and Operating Income Margin Percent Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Reported GAAP operating income $ 1,915.0 $ 1,561.3 $ 1,955.0 23 % (20) % Special (gains) and charges 105.5 495.4 83.1 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income 2,020.5 2,056.7 2,038.1 (2) 1 Effect of foreign currency translation (32.2) (129.1) (251.3) Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income $ 1,988.3 $ 1,927.6 $ 1,786.8 3 % 8 % (percent) 2016 2015 2014 Reported GAAP operating income margin 14.6 % 11.5 % 13.7 % Non-GAAP adjusted operating income margin 15.4 % 15.2 % 14.3 % Non-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 15.3 % 14.9 % 14.0 % Our reported operating income increased 23% when comparing 2016 to 2015 and decreased 20% when comparing 2015 to 2014. Our reported operating income for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2016 adjusted operating income decreased 2% when compared to 2015 adjusted operating income and 2015 adjusted operating income increased 1% when compared to 2014 adjusted operating income.
As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted operating income growth for both 2016 and 2015, as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3% for 2016 and 8% for 2015. Acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted our 2016 adjusted fixed currency operating income growth rates by approximately 1 percentage point. In 2015, acquisitions and divestitures added 1 percentage point to fixed currency operating income growth.
As addressed further in the Segment Performance section of this MD&A, comparisons across 2014 to 2016 were impacted by growth in Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Other offset by the continued challenges within Global Energy.
Interest Expense, Net Reported net interest expense totaled $264.6 million, $243.6 million and $256.6 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The increase in 2016 net interest expense compared to 2015 net interest expense was driven primarily by higher weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt. The decrease in 2015 net interest expense compared to 2014 net interest expense was driven primarily by lower weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt .
Provision for Income Taxes The following table provides a summary of our tax rate: (percent) 2016 2015 2014 Reported GAAP tax rate 24.4 % 22.8 % 28.0 % Tax rate impact of: Special gains and charges 1.0 (0.4) (0.1) Discrete tax items (0.2) 3.5 (0.7) Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 25.2 % 25.9 % 27.2 % Our reported tax rate for 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our overall non-GAAP adjusted tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future.
Our 2016 reported tax rate includes $43.1 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of $3.9 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2015 reported tax rate includes $105.7 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of $63.3 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2014 reported tax rate includes $21.6 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expense of $13.2 million associated with discrete tax items. The corresponding impact of these items on the reported tax rate is shown in the table above.
34 Table of Contents During 2016, we recognized net expenses related to discrete tax items of $3.9 million. The net expenses were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 U.S. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. Net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
Net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of $20.6 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of $39.0 million for the tax basis in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary.
Net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2014 were driven primarily by an update to non-current tax liabilities for certain global tax audits, an adjustment related to the re-characterization of intercompany payments between our U.S. and foreign affiliates, the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in our deferred state tax rate, recognizing adjustments from filing our 2013 U.S. federal and state tax returns, net changes of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the impact from other foreign country audit settlements.
The decrease in our adjusted tax rate from 2014 to 2016 was impacted by global tax planning projects, as well as favorable geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, U.S. domestic tax reform proposals, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix.
Net Income Attributable to Ecolab Percent Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Reported GAAP net income attributable to Ecolab $ 1,229.6 $ 1,002.1 $ 1,202.8 23 % (17) % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges, after tax 62.4 376.9 61.5 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) 3.9 (63.3) 13.2 Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab $ 1,295.9 $ 1,315.7 $ 1,277.5 (2) % 3 % Diluted EPS Percent Change (dollars) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Reported GAAP diluted EPS $ 4.14 $ 3.32 $ 3.93 25 % (16) % Adjustments: Special (gains) and charges 0.21 1.25 0.20 Discrete tax net expense (benefit) 0.01 (0.21) 0.04 Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS $ 4.37 $ 4.37 $ 4.18 0 % 5 % Per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.
Currency translation had a significant unfavorable impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS comparability across 2014 to 2016, with headwinds of approximately $0.31 per share for 2016 compared to 2015 and approximately $0.30 per share for 2015 compared to 2014 .
35 Table of Contents SEGMENT PERFORMANCE The non-U.S. dollar functional international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates used by management for 2016. The difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as effect of foreign currency translation in the following tables. Fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. All other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with U.S. GAAP and the accounting policies described in Note 2.

Corporate Consistent with our internal management reporting, Corporate amounts in the table on page 36 include intangible asset amortization specifically from the Nalco merger and special (gains) and charges that are not allocated to our reportable segments . Items included within special (gains) and charges are shown in the table on page31 .
39 Table of Contents FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY Financial Position Total assets were $18.3 billion as of December31, 2016, compared to total assets of $18.6 billion as of December31, 2015.
The decrease in assets was driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the value of our foreign assets translated into U.S. dollars as of year end 2016 and 2015, the impact of adopting the accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as discussed in Note 2, and the impact of intangible asset amortization.
Total liabilities were $11.4 billion as of December31, 2016, compared to total liabilities of $11.7 billion as of December31, 2015. Total debt was $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $6.5 billion as of December31, 2015. See further discussion of our debt activity within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A.
Our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBIDTA are shown in the following table.

Comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by f luctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable (working capital), the combination of which increased $35 million, $119 million and $212 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The cash flow impact across the three years from accounts receivable was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections. The cash flow impact across the three years from inventories was impacted by timing of purchases and production and usage levels, and from accounts payable was impacted by volume of purchases and timing of payments.
The impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table: Dollar Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Pensions and postretirement plan contributions $ 211.8 $ 64.9 $ 76.7 $ 146.9 $ (11.8) Restructuring payments 51.6 61.7 85.3 (10.1) (23.6) Income tax payments 359.1 533.1 522.0 (174.0) 11.1 Interest payments 267.0 237.2 255.5 29.8 (18.3) 40 Table of Contents Investing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Cash used for investing activities $ (829.5) $ (915.8) $ (848.3) $ 86.3 $ (67.5) Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.
Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $49 million, $265 million and $72 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures across 2016, 2015 and 2014 are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth.
We continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. Total capital expenditures, including software, were $757 million, $815 million and $794 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Comparability of cash used for investing activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by other factors, including the following:  Restricted cash activity in 2016 related to the pending Anios transaction, as discussed further in Note 4.
Settlement of a net investment hedges in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Receipt of Champion related escrow funds in 2015.
Financing Activities Dollar Change (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 Cash used for financing activities $ (868.2) $ (1,150.9) $ (1,071.0) $ 282.7 $ (79.9) Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent consideration.
Our 2016 debt financing activities included the issuance of 575 million 1.00%, $750 million 2.70% , $250 million 3.70%, $400 million 2.00% and $400 million 3.25% fixed rate senior notes; the scheduled repayment of our $1.25 billion 3.00% and 175 million 4.585% senior notes and repayment of the remaining $125 million of our term loan borrowings. Net issuances and repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of $606 million during 2016.
Our 2015 debt financing activities included the issuance of $300 million 1.55%, $300 million 2.25% and 575 million 2.625% fixed rate senior notes; the scheduled repayment of our $250 million 4.875% and $500 million 1.00% senior notes; and repayment of $275 million of term loan borrowings. Net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of $312 million during 2015.
Our 2014 debt financing activities included the repayment of $400 million of term loan borrowings, and the scheduled repayment of our $500 million 2.375% senior notes. Net borrowings of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash inflow of $600 million during 2014.
Shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders.
In February 2015, we announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was completed during the second quarter of 2016 . We repurchased a total of $740 million and $755 million of shares in 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts include $300 million of shares repurchased through the ASR program in both 2016 and 2015, respectively. S ee Note 10 for further information regarding our ASR programs. During 2014, we repurchased $429 million of shares. Cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity.
In December2016, we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 6%. This represents the 25th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 80 consecutive years. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows : First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year 2016 $ 0.350 $ 0.350 $ 0.350 $ 0.370 $ 1.420 2015 0.330 0.330 0.330 0.350 1.340 2014 0.275 0.275 0.275 0.330 1.155 41 Table of Contents Financing activities for 2014 also included an acquisition-related contingent consideration payment of $86 million made to Champions former shareholders .
Liquidity and Capital Resources We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2017, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension contributions, with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.
As of December31, 2016, we had $327 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $184 million was held outside of the U.S.
As of December31, 2015, we had $26 million of deferred tax liabilities for pre-acquisition foreign earnings associated with the legacy Nalco entities and legacy Champion entities that we intended to repatriate.
These liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction.
The remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016, reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero at December 31, 2016.
We consider the remaining portion of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and we have no intention to repatriate such funds. We continue to be focused on building our global business and these funds are available for use by our international operations. To the extent the remaining portion of the foreign earnings would be repatriated, such amounts would be subject to income tax or foreign withholding tax liabilities that may be fully or partially offset by foreign tax credits, both in the U.S. and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2016 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in December 2019. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.
The credit facility supports our $2.0 billion U.S. commercial paper program and $2.0 billion European commercial paper program. We increased the European commercial paper program from $200 million during the third quarter of 2016. Combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had no amount outstanding under either our U.S. or European commercial paper programs.
Additionally, we have other committed and uncommitted credit lines of $746 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs, including with respect to bank supported letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees. Approximately $554 million of these credit lines were available for use as of year-end 2016.
As of December31, 2016, our short-term borrowing program was rated A-2 by Standard& Poors and P-2 by Moodys.
As of December 31, 2016, Standard & Poors and Moodys rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Baa1 (stable outlook), respectively. A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. Should this occur, we could seek additional sources of funding, including issuing additional term notes or bonds. In addition, we have the ability, at our option, to draw upon our $2.0 billion of committed credit facility prior to termination.
We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.
A schedule of our obligations as of December31, 2016 under various notes payable, long-term debt agreements, operating leases with noncancelable terms in excess of one year and interest obligations are summarized in the following table : Payments Due by Period Less More Than 2-3 4-5 Than (millions) Total 1Year Years Years 5Years Notes payable $ 30 $ 30 $ - $ - $ - Commercial paper - - - - - Long-term debt 6,652 510 967 1,567 3,608 Capital lease obligations 5 1 1 1 2 Operating leases 431 102 153 105 71 Interest* 2,261 218 396 360 1,287 Total $ 9,379 $ 861 $ 1,517 $ 2,033 $ 4,968 * Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2016.
As of December31, 2016, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $76 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
42 Table of Contents We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2017 based on plan asset values as of December31, 2016. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $42 million in 2017. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.
Except for the approximately $192 million utilized under the bank lines noted previously supporting domestic and international commercial relationships and transactions, we do not have significant unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments .
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, as discussed further in Note 13, we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships .
Market Risk We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.
We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December31, 2016, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $1,450 million.
See Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity.
Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $50 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items .
GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT Energy Markets During 2016, approximately 23% of our sales were generated from Global Energy, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets.
Oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016, when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures, which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in North America. We also experienced additional pricing headwinds in 2016 when compared to 2015. As a result of these conditions, we recorded charges related to inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, employee termination costs and other charges during the second and fourth quarters of 2016, as discussed further in Note 3.
Demand for oil and overall energy consumption has remained consistent.
Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within Global Energy, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment.
As petroleum derived materials are key inputs to many of our chemical products, lower oil prices provide benefits across our segments in the form of lower raw material costs.
43 Table of Contents Global Economies Approximately half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.
Brexit Referendum The June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (Brexit) resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies.
Brexit is non-binding; however, if passed into law, negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.s relationship with the European Union. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations.
During 2016, net sales of our U.K. operations were approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales.
Global Foreign Currency Markets The U.S. dollar remained strong against most global currencies during 2016, when compared against both 2015 and 2014 levels, impacting our comparative results. As described in Note 8, we utilize our derivative program to mitigate risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures and our investments in foreign operations.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January 2017, we acquired Abednego Environmental Services (Abednego), a privately held company based in Novi, Michigan. Abednego provides water solutions to automotive customers. Pre-acquisition annual sales were approximately $40 million.
On February 1, 2017, we acquired Anios for a total consideration of approximately $800 million in cash, inclusive of the satisfaction of outstanding debt. Anios is a leading European manufacturer and marketer of hygiene and disinfection products for the healthcare, food service, and food and beverage processing industries. Anios provides an innovative product line that expands the solutions we are able to offer while also providing a complementary geographic footprint within the healthcare market.
Pre-acquisition annual sales were approximately $245 million.
In February 2017, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $300 million of our common stock.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:  Fixed currency sales  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales  Adjusted cost of sales  Adjusted gross margin  Fixed currency operating income  Fixed currency operating income margin  Adjusted operating income  Adjusted operating income margin  Adjusted fixed currency operating income  Adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income  Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin  EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted tax rate  Adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab  Adjusted diluted EPS 44 Table of Contents We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
Our non-GAAP financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.
EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are used as inputs to our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.
We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation intoU.S.dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2016. Fixed currency amounts also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to1 U.S. dollar, which was the approximate conversion rate for SIMADI at year end 2015.
Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from both the current period and comparable period of the prior year.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts.

Daniel J. Schmechel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer 46 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Ecolab Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ecolab Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

52 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS Ecolab is the global leader in water, hygiene and energy technologies and services that protect people and vital resources. The Company delivers comprehensive solutions and on-site service to promote safe food, maintain clean environments, optimize water and energy use and improve operational efficiencies for customers in the food, healthcare, energy, hospitality and industrial markets in more than 170 countries.
The Companys cleaning and sanitizing programs and products, pest elimination services, and equipment maintenance and repair services support customers in the foodservice, food and beverage processing, hospitality, healthcare, government and education, retail, textile care and commercial facilities management sectors. The Companys products and technologies are also used in water treatment, pollution control, energy conservation, oil production and refining, steelmaking, papermaking, mining and other industrial processes.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. Investments in companies, joint ventures or partnerships in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are reported using the equity method. Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company determined that it does not meet the accounting criteria for control over its Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, and began accounting for the investments in its Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting, effective in the first quarter of 2016. The cost method of accounting is used in circumstances where the Company has no substantial influence over the investee, and the investment has no easily determinable fair value. International subsidiaries are included in the financial statements on the basis of their U.S. GAAP November 30 fiscal year-ends to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in the Companys consolidated financial reporting. All intercompany transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the Companys financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Companys critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition, valuation allowances and accrued liabilities, actuarially determined liabilities, restructuring, income taxes and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill.
Foreign Currency Translation Financial position and reported results of operations of the Companys non-U.S. dollar functional international subsidiaries are measured using local currencies as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each fiscal year end. The translation adjustments related to assets and liabilities that arise from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity. Income statement accounts are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The Company evaluates its international operations based on fixed rates of exchange; however, the different exchange rates from period to period impact the amount of reported income from consolidated operations.
Concentration of Credit Risk Credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted. The Company believes the likelihood of incurring material losses due to concentration of credit risk is remote. The principal financial instruments subject to credit risk are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company maintains cash deposits with major banks, which from time to time may exceed insured limits. The possibility of loss related to financial condition of major banks has been deemed minimal. Additionally, the Companys investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions.
Accounts Receivable - A large number of customers in diverse industries and geographies, as well as the practice of establishing reasonable credit lines, limits credit risk. Based on historical trends and experiences, the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential credit risk losses.
Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Contracts and Derivatives - Exposure to credit risk is limited by internal policies and active monitoring of counterparty risks. In addition, the Company uses a diversified group of major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.
53 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are carried at the invoiced amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts, and generally do not bear interest. The Company estimates the balance of allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. The Companys estimates include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is determined the receivable will not be recovered.
The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts balance also includes an allowance for the expected return of products shipped and credits related to pricing or quantities shipped of $14 million, $15 million and $14 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Returns and credit activity is recorded directly to sales as a reduction.
The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Beginning balance $ 75 $ 77 $ 81 Bad debt expense 20 26 23 Write-offs (25) (22) (20) Other (a) (2) (6) (7) Ending balance $ 68 $ 75 $ 77 (a) Other amounts are primarily the effects of changes in currency translations and the impact of allowance for returns and credits.
Inventory Valuations Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Certain U.S. inventory costs are determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. LIFO inventories represented 40% and 39% of consolidated inventories as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. LIFO inventories include certain legacy Nalco U.S. inventory acquired at fair value as part of the Nalco merger. All other inventory costs are determined using either the average cost or first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods. Inventory values at FIFO, as shown in Note 5, approximate replacement cost.
During 2015, the Company improved and standardized estimates related to its inventory reserves and product costing, resulting in a net pre-tax charge of approximately $6 million. Separately, the actions resulted in a charge of $20.6 million related to inventory reserve calculations, partially offset by a gain of $14.5 million related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory. During 2016, the Company took additional actions to improve and standardize estimates related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million.
These items are reflected within special (gains) and charges, as discussed in Note 3.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost. Merchandising and customer equipment consists principally of various dispensing systems for the Companys cleaning and sanitizing products, dishwashing machines and process control and monitoring equipment. Certain dispensing systems capitalized by the Company are accounted for on a mass asset basis, whereby equipment is capitalized and depreciated as a group and written off when fully depreciated. The Company capitalizes both internal and external costs of development or purchase of computer software for internal use. Costs incurred for data conversion, training and maintenance associated with capitalized software are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements, which significantly extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or disposition of plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income.
Depreciation is charged to operations using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 40 years for buildings and leasehold improvements, 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment, 3 to 15 years for merchandising and customer equipment and 3 to 7 years for capitalized software. The straight-line method of depreciation reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. Depreciation expense was $561 million, $560 million and $558 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
54 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. The Companys reporting units are its operating segments.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed its scheduled annual assessment for goodwill impairment across its ten reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, which incorporates assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates. The two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting units carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. The Companys goodwill impairment assessment for 2016 indicated the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update the Companys conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016.
If circumstances change significantly, the Company would also test a reporting units goodwill for impairment during interim periods between its annual tests.There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the Companys reportable segments are as follows: Global Global Global (millions) Industrial Institutional Energy Other Total December31, 2014 $ 2,642.2 $ 691.2 $ 3,262.1 $ 121.5 $ 6,717.0 Current year business combinations (a) 84.2 6.1 45.0 0.9 136.2 Prior year business combinations (b) 0.7 - - - 0.7 Dispositions (0.4) - (0.1) - (0.5) Reclassifications (c) (23.7) 2.9 20.8 - - Effect of foreign currency translation (142.2) (37.5) (176.3) (6.6) (362.6) December31, 2015 $ 2,560.8 $ 662.7 $ 3,151.5 $ 115.8 $ 6,490.8 Current year business combinations (a) - 3.1 0.6 - 3.7 Prior year business combinations (b) 3.5 - 0.1 - 3.6 Reclassifications (c) 3.5 (0.6) (2.9) - - Effect of foreign currency translation (45.5) (11.8) (55.7) (2.1) (115.1) December31, 2016 $ 2,522.3 $ 653.4 $ 3,093.6 $ 113.7 $ 6,383.0 (a) For 2016, the Company expects approximately $3.0 million of the goodwill related to businesses acquired to be tax deductible. For 2015, $45.9 million of the goodwill related to businesses acquired is expected to be tax deductible.
(b) Represents purchase price allocation adjustments for acquisitions deemed preliminary as of the end of the prior year.
(c) Represents immaterial reclassifications of beginning balances to conform to the current or prior year presentation due to customer reclassifications across reporting segments completed in the first quarter of the respective year.
Other Intangible Assets The Nalco trade name is the Companys principal indefinite life intangible asset. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed its annual test for indefinite life intangible asset impairment using a relief from royalty method of assessment, which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections and discount rates. Based on this testing, the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin, therefore, no adjustment to the $1.2 billion carrying value of this asset was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update the Companys conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible asset since it was acquired.
The Companys intangible assets subject to amortization primarily include customer relationships, trademarks, patents and other technology. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections and other acceptable valuation methods. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. The weighted-average useful life of amortizable intangible assets was 14 years as of both December 31, 2016 and 2015.
The weighted-average useful life by type of amortizable asset at December 31, 2016 is as follows: (years) Customer relationships 14 Trademarks 14 Patents 14 Other technology 7 55 Table of Contents The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets that are being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a change to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Total amortization expense related to other intangible assets during the last three years and future estimated amortization is as follows: (millions) 2014 $ 305 2015 292 2016 290 2017 287 2018 283 2019 270 2020 264 2021 260 Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically reviews its long-lived and amortizable intangible assets for impairment and assesses whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of an asset. An impairment loss may be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. In 2015, as part of the actions taken regarding its Venezuelan businesses, the Company wrote-off customer relationship intangible assets and other long-lived assets. See Note 3 for additional information regarding Venezuela. Also during 2015 and 2016, the Company impaired certain long-lived assets related to a product line within one of its U.S. plants. See Note 3 for additional information regarding this asset impairment.
In addition, the Company periodically reassesses the estimated remaining useful lives of its long-lived assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization recorded in earnings. The Company has not experienced significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of its long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
Income Taxes Income taxes are recognized during the period in which transactions enter into the determination of financial statement income, with deferred income taxes provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. Deferred income taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries except to the extent such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested in the subsidiary. The Company records liabilities for income tax uncertainties in accordance with the U.S. GAAP recognition and measurement criteria guidance.
During the first quarter of 2016, the Company early-adopted the accounting guidance issued in November 2015 that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, using the prospective application method. Periods prior to the first quarter of 2016 have not been retrospectively adjusted for adoption of this guidance. Previous guidance required the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability. As a result of the new guidance, each jurisdiction now only has one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities within a single jurisdiction.
See Note 12 for additional information regarding income taxes.
Restructuring Activities The Companys restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance its efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen its competitiveness. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets.
56 Table of Contents Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
See Note 3 for additional information regarding restructuring.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists, title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue on services as they are performed. While the Company employs a sales and service team to ensure customers needs are best met in a high quality way, the majority of the Companys revenue is generated from product sales. The Companys service businesses and service offerings are discussed in Note 17. See the New Accounting Pronouncements table within this Note for discussion on future changes to revenue recognition.
The Companys sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. Estimates used in recognizing revenue include the delay between the time that products are shipped and when they are received by customers, when title transfers and the amount of credit memos issued in subsequent periods. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. The Company also records estimated reserves for anticipated uncollectible accounts and for product returns and credits at the time of sale. Depending on market conditions, the Company may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive.
Earnings Per Common Share The difference in the weighted average common shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings attributable to Ecolab per common share is a result of the dilution associated with the Companys equity compensation plans. As noted in the table below, certain stock options and units outstanding under these equity compensation plans were not included in the computation of diluted earnings attributable to Ecolab per common share because they would not have had a dilutive effect.
The computations of the basic and diluted earnings attributable to Ecolab per share amounts were as follows: (millions, except per share) 2016 2015 2014 Net income attributable to Ecolab $ 1,229.6 $ 1,002.1 $ 1,202.8 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 292.5 296.4 300.1 Effect of dilutive stock options and units 4.2 5.0 5.8 Diluted 296.7 301.4 305.9 Basic EPS $ 4.20 $ 3.38 $ 4.01 Diluted EPS $ 4.14 $ 3.32 $ 3.93 Anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of EPS 3.6 3.5 3.4 Other Significant Accounting Policies The following table includes a reference to additional significant accounting policies that are described in other notes to the financial statements, including the note number: Policy Note Fair value measurements 7 Derivatives and hedging transactions 8 Share-based compensation 11 Research and development expenditures 14 Legal contingencies 15 Pension and post-retirement benefit plans 16 Reportable segments 17 57 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements Required Date of Date of Effect on the Standard Issuance Description Adoption Financial Statements Standards that are not yet adopted: ASU 2017-04 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment January 2017 Simplifies subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.

(a) As part of implementing the new standard, the Company is in process of reviewing current accounting policies and assessing the practical expedients allowed under the new accounting guidance. The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption and is currently evaluating other impacts on the consolidated financial statements. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition to be applied at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption.
(b) The Companys approach to implementing the new standard includes performing a detailed review of key contracts representative of its different businesses, and comparing historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard. The Company is focusing on the identification and evaluation of performance obligations within certain contracts, as well as the classification of certain costs associated with the identified performance obligations. In addition to expanded disclosures associated with the new standard, the Company is continuing to assess the impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The guidance permits two methods of adoption, retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).

SPECIAL (GAINS) AND CHARGES Special (gains) and charges reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income included the following: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Cost of sales Restructuring activities $ (0.4) $ 16.5 $ 13.9 Inventory costs (6.2) (14.5) - Inventory reserves - 20.6 - Energy related charges 62.6 - - Fixed asset impairment and other inventory charges 10.0 24.7 0.4 Venezuela related activities - 33.3 - Subtotal 66.0 80.6 14.3 Special (gains) and charges Restructuring activities (8.7) 83.8 69.2 Champion and Nalco integration costs - 18.7 28.4 Energy related charges 14.2 - - Venezuela related activities (7.8) 256.0 - Other 41.8 56.3 (28.8) Subtotal 39.5 414.8 68.8 Operating income subtotal 105.5 495.4 83.1 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest Restructuring activities - (1.7) - Venezuela related activities - (11.1) - Subtotal - (12.8) - Total special (gains) and charges $ 105.5 $ 482.6 $ 83.1 For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with the Companys internal management reporting .
Restructuring Activities Energy Restructuring Plan In April 2013, following the completion of the Champion transaction, the Company commenced plans to undertake restructuring and other cost-saving actions to realize its acquisition-related cost synergies as well as streamline and strengthen Ecolabs position in the global energy market. Actions associated with the acquisition to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business included a reduction of the combined businesss global workforce. Actions also included leveraging and simplifying its global supply chain, including the reduction of plant, distribution center and redundant facility locations and product line optimization.
60 Table of Contents Restructuring charges within the Energy Restructuring Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016. Cumulative restructuring charges of $89 million ($60 million after tax and net of the impact from noncontrolling interest), are materially consistent with the Companys initial expectation of $80 million ($55 million after tax).
The Company recorded restructuring charges of $4.5 million ($2.6 million after tax), $47.2 million ($33.0 million after tax) and $9.5 million ($6.4 million after tax) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of the ownership structure of certain entities holding Energy Restructuring Plan charges, the Company reflected $1.7 million of the 2015 charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Restructuring charges and activity related to the Energy Restructuring Plan since inception of the underlying actions include the following: Employee Termination Asset (millions) Costs Disposals Other Total 2013 - 2015 Activity Recorded expense and accrual $ 55.6 $ 13.2 $ 15.3 $ 84.1 Net cash payments (44.3) 3.9 (2.1) (42.5) Non-cash charges - (17.1) - (17.1) Effect of foreign currency translation 0.4 - - 0.4 Restructuring liability, December31, 2015 11.7 - 13.2 24.9 2016 Activity Recorded expense (income) and accrual (1.0) 0.8 4.7 4.5 Net cash payments (6.2) - (8.2) (14.4) Non-cash charges - (0.8) - (0.8) Effect of foreign currency translation (0.2) - - (0.2) Restructuring liability, December31, 2016 $ 4.3 $ - $ 9.7 $ 14.0 The majority of cash payments under this plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. The Company anticipates the remaining cash expenditures will continue to be funded from operating activities.
Combined Plan In February 2011, the Company commenced a comprehensive plan to substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its European business, as well as to undertake certain restructuring activities outside of Europe, historically referred to as the 2011 Restructuring Plan. Additionally, in January 2012 and following the merger with Nalco, the Company formally commenced plans to undertake restructuring actions related to the reduction of its global workforce and optimization of its supply chain and office facilities, including planned reduction of plant and distribution center locations, historically referred to as the Merger Restructuring Plan. During the first quarter of 2013, the Company determined that because the objectives of the plans discussed above were aligned, the previously separate restructuring plans should be combined into one plan.
The Combined Plan combines opportunities and initiatives from both plans and continues to follow the original format of the Merger Restructuring Plan by focusing on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities, including reductions of the global workforce, plant and distribution center locations.
Restructuring charges within the Combined Plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, with c ertain immaterial actions continuing into 2016.
Cumulative restructuring charges of $391 million ($297 million after tax), are materially consistent with the Companys initial expectation of $400 million ($300 million after tax).
The Company recorded net gains of $13.6 million ($13.4 million after tax) during 2016 primarily related to gains on the sale of certain facilities related to previous restructuring initiatives. The Company recorded net charges of $53.0 million ($44.2 million after tax) and $73.5 million ($58.5 million after tax) during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
61 Table of Contents Restructuring charges and activity related to the Combined Plan since inception of the underlying actions include the following: Employee Termination Asset (millions) Costs Disposals Other Total 2011 - 2015 Activity Recorded expense and accrual $ 349.7 $ 6.1 $ 48.4 $ 404.2 Net cash payments (281.3) 16.3 (38.1) (303.1) Non-cash net charges 0.6 (22.4) (4.7) (26.5) Effect of foreign currency translation (9.4) - - (9.4) Restructuring liability, December31, 2015 59.6 - 5.6 65.2 2016 Activity Recorded expense (income) and accrual (3.1) (9.9) (0.6) (13.6) Net cash payments (32.8) 22.3 (4.4) (14.9) Non-cash net charges - (12.4) - (12.4) Effect of foreign currency translation 1.3 - - 1.3 Restructuring liability, December31, 2016 $ 25.0 $ - $ 0.6 $ 25.6 The majority of cash payments under the Combined Plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. The Company anticipates the remaining cash expenditures will continue to be funded from operating activities.
Non-restructuring Special (Gains) and Charges Energy related charges Oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures, which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in North America.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration obligations, commercial paper, notes payable, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and long-term debt.
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. A hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the most observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels: Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs include observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.

The carrying value of interest rate swap contracts is at fair value, which is determined based on current interest rates and forward interest rates as of the balance sheet date and is classified within level 2. For purposes of fair value disclosure above, derivative values are presented gross. See further discussion of gross versus net presentation of the Company's derivatives within Note 8.
Contingent consideration obligations are recognized and measured at fair value at the acquisition date and thereafter until settlement. Contingent consideration is classified within level 3 as the underlying fair value is measured based on the probability-weighted present value of the consideration expected to be transferred. The consideration expected to be transferred is based on the Companys expectations of various financial measures. The ultimate payment of contingent consideration could deviate from current estimates based on the actual results of these financial measures.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations during 2016 and 2015 were as follows: (millions) 2016 2015 Contingent consideration at beginning of year $ 15.6 $ 1.3 Amount recognized at transaction date - 16.0 Losses (gains) recognized in earnings (2.4) (0.2) Settlements (12.6) (1.0) Foreign currency translation (0.6) (0.5) Contingent consideration at end of year $ - $ 15.6 The carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, commercial paper and notes payable approximate fair value because of their short maturities, and as such are classified within level 1.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency debt to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and net investments in foreign operations. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments of a speculative nature or for trading purposes. The Company records derivatives as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivative qualifies and is designated as a hedge. Cash flows from derivatives are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. If a derivative is no longer expected to be effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings.
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance of counterparties for foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The Company monitors its exposure to credit risk by using credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties, and therefore, recording a valuation allowance against the Companys derivative balance is not considered necessary.
Derivative Positions Summary Certain of the Companys derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements that allow the Company to net settle contracts with the same counterparties. These arrangements generally do not call for collateral and as of the applicable dates presented below, no cash collateral had been received or pledged related to the underlying derivatives.
The respective net amounts are included in other current assets, other non-current assets and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The following table summarizes the gross fair value of the Companys outstanding derivatives.

71 Table of Contents Cash Flow Hedges The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted foreign currency transactions, including inventory purchases and intercompany royalty, management fee and other payments. These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portions of the changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the hedged items affect earnings, at which time the gain or loss is reclassified into the same line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income as the underlying exposure being hedged. All cash flow hedged transactions are forecasted to occur within the next two years.
The Company occasionally enters into forward starting interest rate swap or treasury lock agreements to manage interest rate exposure.
During 2016 and 2015, the Company entered into and subsequently closed a series of treasury lock and forward starting interest rate swap agreements, in conjunction with both its U.S. public debt issuances in January and October 2016, as discussed in Note 6.
During 2014, the Company entered into and subsequently closed a series of forward starting interest rate swap agreements in connection with both its U.S. public debt issuance completed in January 2015 and its euro public debt issuance completed in July 2015. During 2011, the Company entered into and subsequently closed a series of forward starting interest rate swap agreements in connection with the issuance of its private placement debt. During 2006, the Company entered into and subsequently closed two forward starting interest rate swap agreements related to the issuance of its senior euro notes.
The agreements noted above were designated and effective as a cash flow hedge of the expected interest payments related to the anticipated future debt issuance. Amounts recorded in AOCI for the respective transactions above are recognized as part of interest expense over the remaining life of the notes as the forecasted interest transactions occur.
The effective portion of gains and losses recognized into AOCI and earnings from derivative contracts that qualified as cash flow hedges was as follows: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Unrealized gain (loss) recognized into AOCI Foreign currency forward contracts AOCI (equity) AOCI (equity) $ 7.0 $ 68.4 $ 26.7 Interest rate swap agreements AOCI (equity) AOCI (equity) (9.3) 3.6 (22.1) Total Total (2.3) 72.0 4.6 (millions) Gain (loss) recognized in income Foreign currency forward contracts Cost of sales Cost of sales 23.0 30.9 6.1 SG&A SG&A (0.1) 24.7 1.5 Interest expense, net Interest expense, net 5.8 2.9 - Subtotal Total 28.7 58.5 7.6 Interest rate swap agreements Interest expense, net Interest expense, net (6.6) (5.5) (4.1) Total Total $ 22.1 $ 53.0 $ 3.5 Gains and losses recognized in income related to the ineffective portion of the Companys cash flow hedges were insignificant during 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Fair Value Hedges The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps under which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
In January 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted its $400 million 2.00% debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate. In January 2015, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that converted its $300 million 1.55% debt, its $250 million 3.69% debt and a portion of its $1.25 billion 3.00% debt from fixed rates to floating interest rates. In May2014, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted its $500 million 1.45% debt from a fixed rate to a floating interest rate. The interest rate swap agreement tied to a portion of the Companys $1.25 billion 3.00% debt expired in December 2016 upon repayment of the underlying debt.
The interest rate swaps referenced above were designated as fair value hedges.
72 Table of Contents The impact on earnings from derivative contracts that qualified as fair value hedges was as follows: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Gain (loss) on derivative recognized income Interest rate swap Interest expense,net $ (1.4) $ 0.0 $ (2.1) Gain (loss) on hedged item recognized income Interest rate swap Interestexpense,net $ 1.4 $ (0.0) $ 2.1 Net Investment Hedges The Company designates its outstanding 1,150 million (total of $1,214 million as of year-end 2016) senior notes and related accrued interest as a hedge of existing foreign currency exposures related to net investments the Company has in certain euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. The series B euro denominated private placement notes that were also designated as a hedge of existing foreign currency exposures matured in December 2016.
The revaluation gains and losses on the euro notes and of the forward contracts, which are designated and effective as hedges of the Companys net investments, have been included as a component of the cumulative translation adjustment account, and were as follows: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Revaluation gains (losses), net of tax $ (2.5) $ 101.3 $ 34.7 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset its exposure to the change in value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held at foreign subsidiaries, primarily receivables and payables, which are remeasured at the end of each period. Although the contracts are effective economic hedges, they are not designated as accounting hedges. Therefore, changes in the value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The impact on earnings from derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments was as follows: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Gain (loss) recognized in income Foreign currency forward contracts SG&A $ (6.0) $ 15.9 $ 8.6 Interest expense,net (8.4) (8.6) (9.0) Total $ (14.4) $ 7.3 $ (0.4) The amounts recognized in SG&A above offset the earnings impact of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The amounts recognized in interest expense above represent the component of the hedging gains (losses) attributable to the difference between the spot and forward rates of the hedges as a result of interest rate differentials.
9. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INFORMATION Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrecognized gains and losses on securities, defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, gains and losses on derivative instruments designated and effective as cash flow hedges and non-derivative instruments designated and effective as foreign currency net investment hedges that are charged or credited to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account in shareholders equity.
The following table provides other comprehensive income (loss) information related to the Companys derivatives and hedging instruments and pension and postretirement benefits. See Note 8 for additional information related to the Companys derivatives and hedging transactions.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Authorized common stock, par value $1.00 per share, was 800 million shares at December31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Treasury stock is stated at cost. Dividends declared per share of common stock were $1.420 for 2016, $1.340 for 2015 and $1.155 for 2014.
The Company has 15 million shares, without par value, of authorized but unissued and undesignated preferred stock. The Companys former shareholder rights agreement was amended in December2012 and the rights agreement was terminated as of December31, 2012. Prior to termination of the rights agreement, 0.4 million shares of preferred stock were designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and were reserved for issuance in connection with the rights agreement, with the remaining 14.6 million shares of preferred stock being undesignated. Following termination of the rights agreement, a Certificate of Elimination of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock was filed on January 2, 2013 with the Delaware Secretary of State to restore the 0.4 million shares designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock to the status of undesignated preferred stock.
Share Repurchase Authorization The Company has a share repurchase program and generally repurchases shares on the open market to offset the dilutive effect of its equity compensation plans, with repurchases above that level used to manage the Companys capital structure and efficiently return capital to shareholders.
In August 2011, the Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, via delegation by the Companys Board of Directors, authorized the repurchase of 10 million common shares, including shares to be repurchased under Rule 10b5-1, which was contingent upon completion of the merger with Nalco. This authorization was completed during the first quarter of 2016.
In February 2015, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million additional shares of its common stock, including shares to be repurchased under Rule 10b5-1. In February 2015, under the existing repurchase authorization, the Company announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was completed during the second quarter of 2016.
As of December 31, 2016, 16,772,526 shares remained to be repurchased under the Companys repurchase authorization. The Company intends to repurchase all shares under its authorization, for which no expiration date has been established, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions.
74 Table of Contents Accelerated Stock Repurchase (ASR) Agreements In February 2015, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $300 million of its common stock and received 2,066,293 shares of its common stock, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares the Company expected to be repurchased under the ASR, based on the price of the Companys common stock at that time. In February 2016, the Company entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase $300 million of its common stock and received 2,459,490 shares of its common stock, which was approximately 85% of the total number of shares the Company expected to be repurchased under the ASR, based on the price of the Companys common stock at that time.
The final per share purchase price and the total number of shares to be repurchased under both 2016 and 2015 ASR agreements generally were based on the volume-weighted average price of the Companys common stock during the term of the agreements. Upon final settlement of the two ASR agreements, under certain circumstances, the financial institutions were obligated to deliver additional shares to the Company or the Company was obligated to deliver additional shares of common stock or make a cash payment, at the Companys election, to the financial institutions.
In connection with the finalization of the ASR agreement in April 2015, the Company received an additional 555,511 shares of common stock. In connection with the finalization of the ASR agreement in May 2016, the Company received an additional 232,012 shares of common stock.
All shares acquired under the ASR agreements were recorded as treasury stock.
During their respective open periods in 2015 and 2016, neither of the ASRs was dilutive to the Companys earnings per share calculations, nor did they trigger the two-class earnings per share methodology. Additionally, the unsettled portion of ASRs during their respective open periods met the criteria to be accounted for as a forward contract indexed to the Companys stock and qualified as equity transactions.
The initial delivery of shares, as well as the additional receipt of shares at settlement resulted in a reduction to the Companys common stock outstanding used to calculate earnings per share, the impact of which was not material.
In February 2017, separate from the ASRs discussed above, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $300 million of its common stock.
Share Repurchases In accordance with its share repurchase program through open market or private purchases, including the ASR discussed above, the Company reacquired 6,126,033 shares, 6,267,699 shares and 3,547,334 shares of its common stock in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The Company also reacquired 357,165, 398,704 and 489,854 shares withheld for taxes related to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of stock awards and units in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
11. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS The Company measures compensation expense for share-based awards at fair value at the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The majority of grants to retirement eligible recipients (age 55 with required years of service) are attributed to expense using the non-substantive vesting method and are fully expensed over a six month period following the date of grant. In addition, the Company includes a forfeiture estimate in the amount of compensation expense being recognized based on an estimate of the number of outstanding awards expected to vest.
The Companys equity compensation plans provide for grants of stock options, performance-based restricted stock units (PBRSUs) andnon-performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs). Common shares available for grant as of December31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 13,649,667, 15,888,937 and 17,999,689, respectively. The Company generally issues authorized but previously unissued shares to satisfy stock option exercises and stock award vestings.
The Companys annual long-term incentive share-based compensation program is made up of 50% stock options and 50% PBRSUs. The Company also periodically grants RSUs. Total compensation expense related to all share-based compensation plans was $86 million ($59 million net of tax benefit), $78 million ($54 million net of tax benefit) and $71 million ($49 million net of tax benefit) for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December31, 2016, there was $137 million of total measured but unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under all of the Companys plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
Stock Options Stock options are granted to purchase shares of the Companys stock at the average daily share price on the date of grant. These options generally expire within ten years from the grant date. The Company generally recognizes compensation expense for these 75 Table of Contents awards on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period. As previously noted, stock option grants to retirement eligible recipients are attributed to expense using the non-substantive vesting method.
A summary of stock option activity and average exercise prices is as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Number of Exercise Number of Exercise Number of Exercise Options Price (a) Options Price (a) Options Price (a) Outstanding, beginning of year 12,378,372 $ 74.23 13,169,776 $ 63.88 13,926,256 $ 55.66 Granted 1,679,941 117.60 1,686,816 118.99 1,645,937 107.63 Exercised (2,061,553) 50.33 (2,316,025) 46.22 (2,316,918) 44.79 Canceled (86,259) 111.08 (162,195) 99.67 (85,499) 83.81 Outstanding, end of year 11,910,501 $ 84.22 12,378,372 $ 74.23 13,169,776 $ 63.88 Exercisable, end of year 8,720,943 $ 72.35 9,248,880 $ 61.18 9,820,826 $ 52.21 Vested and expected to vest, end of year 11,688,758 $ 83.63 (a) Represents weighted average price per share.
The total aggregate intrinsic value of options (the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the option on the date of exercise) that were exercised during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $140 million, $160 million and $150 million, respectively.
The total aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December31, 2016 was $398 million, with a corresponding weighted-average remaining contractual life of 6.4 years. The total aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable as of December31, 2016 was $395 million, with a corresponding weighted-average remaining contractual life of 5.3 years. The total aggregate intrinsic value of options vested and expected to vest as of December31, 2016 was $397 million, with a corresponding weighted-average remaining contractual life of 6.3 years.
The lattice (binomial) option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options at grant date. The Companys primary employee option grant occurs during the fourth quarter. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted and the significant assumptions used in determining the underlying fair value of each option grant, on the date of grant were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted at market prices $ 25.59 $ 25.71 $ 23.18 Assumptions Risk-free rate of return 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.8 % Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 22.9 % 22.9 % 22.9 % Expected dividend yield 1.3 % 1.2 % 1.2 % The risk-free rate of return is determined based on a yield curve of U.S. treasury rates from one month to ten years and a period commensurate with the expected life of the options granted. Expected volatility is established based on historical volatility of the Companys stock price. The expected dividend yield is determined based on the Companys annual dividend amount as a percentage of the average stock price at the time of the grant.
PBRSUs, RSUs and RSAs The expense associated with PBRSUs is based on the average of the high and low share price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the absence of future dividends. The awards vest based on the Company achieving a defined performance target and with continued service for a three year period. Upon vesting, the Company issues shares of its common stock such that one award unit equals one share of common stock. The Company assesses the probability of achieving the performance target and recognizes expense over the three year vesting period when it is probable the performance target will be met. PBRSU awards granted to retirement eligible recipients are attributed to expense using the non-substantive vesting method. The awards are generally subject to forfeiture in the event of termination of employment.
The expense associated with shares of non-performance based RSUs and RSAs is based on the average of the high and low share price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the absence of future dividends and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods during which the restrictions lapse. The Company currently has RSUs that vest over periods between 12 and 84 months. The remaining RSAs vested during 2015. The awards are generally subject to forfeiture in the event of termination of employment.

The state loss carryforwards expire from 2017 to 2036. For the international loss carryforwards, $19.7 million expire from 2017 to 2036 and $22.3 million have no expiration.
77 Table of Contents The Company had valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets of $19.9 million and $31.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016, the Company determined sufficient positive income trends existed to conclude it was more likely than not it would be able to realize the benefits of the net operating losses and other deferred tax assets within certain underlying foreign entities for which valuation allowances had been recorded, thus resulting in valuation allowance releases of $11.5 million. The reduction in valuation allowance from year end 2015 to year end 2016 was also driven by current year utilization and foreign currency translation.
The Companys U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward of $21.8 million has a ten-year carryforward period and will expire between 2019 and 2025 if not utilized.
The Company obtains tax benefits from tax holidays in three foreign jurisdictions, the Dominican Republic, China and Singapore. The Company received a permit of operation, which expires in July 2021, from the National Council of Free Zones of Exportation for the Dominican Republic. Companies operating under the Free Zones are not subject to income tax in the Dominican Republic on export income. In addition, one of the Companys legal entities in China is entitled to the benefit of incentives provided by the Chinese government to technology companies in order to encourage development of the high-tech industry, including reduced tax rates and other measures. As a result, the Company was entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% so long as the Company's manufacturing facilities in China continue to maintain their High and New Technology Enterprise (HNTE) status. Finally, in Singapore,the Company was awarded the Development and Expansion Incentive under the International Headquarters program. This provides for a preferential 10% tax rate on certain headquarter income and is valid until February 2018. The tax reduction as the result of the tax holidays for 2016 was $6.4 million, or approximately $0.02 per diluted share. The impact of the tax holiday was similar during 2015 and 2014.
A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate is as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Statutory U.S. rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 0.9 0.4 1.6 Foreign operations (8.0) (8.1) (6.1) Domestic manufacturing deduction (2.0) (2.7) (2.0) R&D credit (1.1) (1.0) (0.7) Change in valuation allowance (0.7) (1.7) (0.1) Audit settlements and refunds (0.2) (0.7) 0.2 Venezuela charges - 4.5 - Worthless stock deduction 0.4 (3.0) - Other, net 0.1 0.1 0.1 Effective income tax rate 24.4 % 22.8 % 28.0 % As of December31, 2015, the Company had deferred tax liabilities of $25.8 million on foreign earnings of the legacy Nalco entities and legacy Champion entities that the Company intended to repatriate. The deferred tax liabilities originated based on purchase accounting decisions made in connection with the Nalco merger and Champion acquisition and were the result of extensive studies required to calculate the impact at the purchase date. The remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016, thus reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero as of December 31, 2016.
U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on certain other unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested which were approximately $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion as of December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These earnings are considered to be reinvested indefinitely or available for distribution with foreign tax credits to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that may be payable on remittance. It is impractical due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise if all undistributed earnings were distributed.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. state and international jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012. The IRS has completed examinations of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns (Ecolab and Nalco) through 2012. The IRS has completed examinations of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns (Champion) through 2011 and tax year 2012 is closed by statute of limitations. The Companys U.S. federal income tax return for the years 2013 and 2014 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company anticipates changes to its uncertain tax positions due to closing of various audit years mentioned above. The Company does not believe these changes will result in a material impact during the next twelve months. Decreases in the Companys gross liability could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments, and/or adjustments to tax expense. The occurrence of these events and/or other events not included above within the next twelve months could change depending on a variety of factors and result in amounts different from above.
During 2016, the Company recognized net expense related to discrete tax items of $3.9 million. The net expenses were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing the Companys 2015 U.S. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. Net expense was also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
78 Table of Contents During 2015, the Company recognized net benefits related to discrete tax items of $63.3 million. The net benefits were driven primarily by the release of $20.6 million of valuation allowances, based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of $39.0 million for the tax basis in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary.
During 2014, the Company recognized net expenses related to discrete tax items of $13.2 million. The net expenses were driven primarily by an update to non-current tax liabilities for certain global tax audits, an adjustment related to the re-characterization of intercompany payments between its U.S. and foreign affiliates, the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in its deferred state tax rate, recognizing adjustments from filing its 2013 U.S. federal and state tax returns, net changes of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the impact from other foreign country audit settlements.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (millions) 2016 2015 2014 Balance at beginning of year $ 74.6 $ 78.7 $ 98.7 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 8.8 5.8 5.3 Additions for tax positions of prior years 2.1 0.9 5.2 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (1.0) (8.8) (17.8) Reductions for tax positions due to statute of limitations (5.5) (1.6) (0.2) Settlements (2.0) (4.2) (9.0) Assumed in connection with acquisitions - 8.0 - Foreign currency translation (1.1) (4.2) (3.5) Balance at end of year $ 75.9 $ 74.6 $ 78.7 The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized would have affected the effective tax rate by $57.5 million as of December 31, 2016, $59.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and $64.0 million as of December 31, 2014.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. During 2016 and 2015 the Company released $2.9 million and $1.4 million related to interest and penalties, respectively and during 2014 it accrued $6.6 million related to interest and penalties. The Company had $10.2 million and $13.1 million of accrued interest, including minor amounts for penalties, at December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
13. RENTALS AND LEASES The Company leases sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles and other equipment under operating leases. Total rental expense under the Companys operating leases was $221 million in both 2016 and 2015 and $237 million in 2014. As of December31, 2016, identifiable future minimum payments with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year were: (millions) 2017 $ 102 2018 83 2019 70 2020 56 2021 49 Thereafter 71 Total $ 431 The Company enters into operating leases for vehicles whose non-cancelable terms are one year or less in duration with month-to-month renewal options. These leases have been excluded from the table above. The Company estimates payments under such leases will approximate $58 million in 2017. These vehicle leases have guaranteed residual values that have historically been satisfied by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.
14. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES Research expenditures that relate to the development of new products and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to existing products, are expensed as incurred. Such costs were $189 million in 2016, $191 million in 2015 and $197 million in 2014. The Company did not participate in any material customer sponsored research during 2016, 2015 or 2014.
79 Table of Contents 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to, among other things, workers compensation, general liability (including product liability), automobile claims, health care claims, environmental matters and lawsuits. The Company is also subject to various claims and contingencies related to income taxes, which are discussed in Note 12. The Company also has contractual obligations including lease commitments, which are discussed in Note 13.
The Company records liabilities where a contingent loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, the Company records the most probable estimate of the loss or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. The Company discloses a contingent liability even if the liability is not probable or the amount is not estimable, or both, if there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred.
Insurance Globally, the Company has insurance policies with varying deductibility levels for property and casualty losses. The Company is insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and has recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. The Company is self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. The Company determines its liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.
Litigation and Environmental Matters The Company and certain subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits, claims and environmental actions that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. These include from time to time antitrust, commercial, patent infringement, product liability and wage hour lawsuits, as well as possible obligations to investigate and mitigate the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain chemical substances at various sites, such as Superfund sites and other operating or closed facilities. The Company has established accruals for certain lawsuits, claims and environmental matters. The Company currently believes that there is not a reasonably possible risk of material loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these legal matters. Because litigation is inherently uncertain, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. The Company currently believes that such future charges related to suits and legal claims, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position.
Environmental Matters The Company is currently participating in environmental assessments and remediation at approximately 40 locations, the majority of which are in the U.S., and environmental liabilities have been accrued reflecting managements best estimate of future costs. Potential insurance reimbursements are not anticipated in the Companys accruals for environmental liabilities.
Matters Related to Wage Hour Claims The Company is a defendant in several pending wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the FLSA or a similar state law. In Martino v. Ecolab, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, case no. 5:14-cv-04358-SG, an action under California state law, the Court has certified a class of California Institutional Territory Managers alleging violation of state wage and hour laws.This matter has been settled. The Company has established an accrual to fund the settlement, which is not material to its results of operations or financial position. The Company is a defendant in other wage hour lawsuits brought by Institutional Route Sales Managers seeking class certification of claims for overtime and other relief under federal or state laws. None of these matters are considered to be material to the Companys results of operations or financial position.
Matters Related to Deepwater Horizon Incident Response On April22, 2010, the deepwater drilling platform, the Deepwater Horizon, operated by a subsidiary of BP plc, sank in the Gulf of Mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on April20, 2010. A massive oil spill resulted. Approximately one week following the incident, subsidiaries of BP plc, under the authorization of the responding federal agencies, formally requested Nalco Company, now an indirect subsidiary of Ecolab, to supply large quantities of COREXIT 9500, a Nalco oil dispersant product listed on the U.S. EPA National Contingency Plan Product Schedule. Nalco Company responded immediately by providing available COREXIT and increasing production to supply the product to BPs subsidiaries for use, as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government throughout the incident. Prior to the incident, Nalco and its subsidiaries had not provided products or services or otherwise had any involvement with the Deepwater Horizon platform. On July15, 2010, BP announced that it had capped the leaking well, and the application of dispersants by the responding parties ceased shortly thereafter.
80 Table of Contents On May1, 2010, the President appointed retired U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen to serve as the National Incident Commander in charge of the coordination of the response to the incident at the national level. The EPA directed numerous tests of all the dispersants on the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule, including those provided by Nalco Company, to ensure decisions about ongoing dispersant use in the Gulf of Mexico are grounded in the best available science. Nalco Company cooperated with this testing process and continued to supply COREXIT, as requested by BP and government authorities. After review and testing of a number of dispersants, on September30, 2010, and on August2, 2010, the EPA released toxicity data for eight oil dispersants.
The use of dispersants by the responding parties was one tool used by the government and BP to avoid and reduce damage to the Gulf area from the spill. Since the spill occurred, the EPA and other federal agencies have closely monitored conditions in areas where dispersant was applied. Nalco Company has encouraged ongoing monitoring and review of COREXIT and other dispersants and has cooperated fully with the governmental review and approval process. However, in connection with its provision of COREXIT, Nalco Company has been named in several lawsuits as described below.
Cases arising out of the Deepwater Horizon accident were administratively transferred for pre-trial purposes to a judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana with other related cases under In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on April20, 2010, Case No.10-md-02179 (E.D. La.) (MDL 2179).
Putative ClassAction Litigation Nalco Company was named, along with other unaffiliated defendants, in six putative class action complaints related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill: Adams v. Louisiana, et al., Case No.11-cv-01051 (E.D. La.); Elrod, et al. v. BP Exploration& Production Inc., et al., 12-cv-00981 (E.D. La.); Harris, et al. v.

The cases were filed on behalf of various potential classes of persons who live and work in or derive income from the effected Coastal region. Each of the actions contains substantially similar allegations, generally alleging, among other things, negligence relating to the use of our COREXIT dispersant in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The plaintiffs in these putative class action lawsuits are generally seeking awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees and costs. These cases have been consolidated in MDL 2179.
Other Related Claims Pending in MDL 2179 Nalco Company was also named, along with other unaffiliated defendants, in 23 complaints filed by individuals: Alexander, et al. v. BP Exploration & Production, et al., Case No. 11-cv-00951 (E.D. La.); Best v. British Petroleum plc, et al., Case No. 11-cv-00772 (E.D. La.); Black v. BP Exploration & Production, Inc., et al.

BP, plc, et al., Case No. 1:10-cv-00432-HSO-JMR (S.D. Miss.). The cases were filed on behalf of individuals and entities that own property, live, and/or work in or derive income from the effected Coastal region. Each of the actions contains substantially similar allegations, generally alleging, among other things, negligence relating to the use of our COREXIT dispersant in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits are generally seeking awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees and costs.
Pursuant to orders issued by the court in MDL 2179, the claims were consolidated in several master complaints, including one naming Nalco Company and others who responded to the Gulf Oil Spill (known as the B3 Master Complaint). On May 18, 2012, Nalco filed a motion for summary judgment against the claims in the B3 Master Complaint, on the grounds that: (i) Plaintiffs claims are preempted by the comprehensive oil spill response scheme set forth in the Clean Water Act and National Contingency Plan; and (ii) Nalco is entitled to derivative immunity from suit. On November 28, 2012, the Court granted Nalcos motion and dismissed with prejudice the claims in the B3 Master Complaint asserted against Nalco. The Court held that such claims were preempted by the Clean Water Act and National Contingency Plan. Because claims in the B3 Master Complaint remain pending against other defendants, the Courts decision is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a), plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the Courts decision.
81 Table of Contents Nalco Company, the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as first party defendants by Transocean Deepwater Drilling, Inc. and its affiliates (the Transocean Entities) (In re the Complaint and Petition of Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, et al, MDL No. 2179, Civil Action 10-2771). In April and May 2011, the Transocean Entities, Cameron International Corporation, Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., M-I L.L.C., Weatherford U.S., L.P. and Weatherford International, Inc. (collectively, the Cross Claimants) filed cross claims in MDL 2179 against Nalco Company and other unaffiliated cross defendants. The Cross Claimants generally allege, among other things, that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon explosion, oil spill and/or spill response, they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants.
In April and June 2011, in support of its defense of the claims against it, Nalco Company filed counterclaims against the Cross Claimants. In its counterclaims, Nalco Company generally alleges that if it is found liable for damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon explosion, oil spill and/or spill response, it is entitled to contribution or indemnity from the Cross Claimants.
In December2012 and January2013, the MDL 2179 court issued final orders approving two settlements between BP and Plaintiffs Class Counsel: (1) a proposed Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement; and (2) a proposed Economic and Property Damages Class Action Settlement. Pursuant to the proposed settlements, class members agree to release claims against BP and other released parties, including Nalco Energy Services, LP, Nalco Holding Company, Nalco Finance Holdings LLC, Nalco Finance Holdings Inc., Nalco Holdings LLC and Nalco Company.
In May 2016, Nalco was named in nine additional complaints filed by individuals alleging, among other things, business and economic loss resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill: Seng Lim v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-03950 (E.D. La.); Dai Nguyen v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-03952 (E.D. La.); Thanh Duong v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-03953 (E.D. La.); Nghia Nguyen v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-03954 (E.D. La.); Loc Van Nguyen v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-03955 (E.D. La.); Hanh Phan v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-03956 (E.D. La.); Anh Ly v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-03957 (E.D. La.); Danny Tam Ly v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-04027 (E.D. La.); Terry v. BP, Case No. 2:16-cv-04137 (E.D. La.).The plaintiffs in these lawsuits are generally seeking awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees and costs.These actions have been consolidated in the MDL and the Company expects they will be dismissed pursuant to the Courts November 28, 2012 order granting Nalcos motion for summary judgment.
The Company believes the claims asserted against Nalco Company are without merit and intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously. The Company also believes that it has rights to contribution and/or indemnification (including legal expenses) from third parties. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits, the involvement it might have in these matters in the future, or the potential for future litigation.
16. RETIREMENT PLANS Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans The Company has a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering the majority of its U.S. employees. The Company also has non-contributory non-qualified defined benefit plans, which provide for benefits to employees in excess of limits permitted under its U.S. pension plans. Various international subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans. The Company provides postretirement health care benefits to certain U.S. employees and retirees.
The non-qualified plans are not funded and the recorded benefit obligation for the non-qualified plans was $125 million and $122 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The measurement date used for determining the U.S. pension plan assets and obligations is December 31.
International plans are funded based on local country requirements. The measurement date used for determining the international pension plan assets and obligations is November 30, the fiscal year-end of the Companys international affiliates.
The U.S postretirement health care plans are contributory based on years of service and choice of coverage (family or single), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The measurement date used to determine the U.S. postretirement health care plan assets and obligations is December 31. Certain employees outside the U.S. are covered under government-sponsored programs, which are not required to be fully funded. The expense and obligation for providing international postretirement health care benefits are not significant.

A discount rate is estimated for the U.S. plans and is based on the durations of the underlying plans.
84 Table of Contents At the end of 2015, the Company changed the approach used to measure service and interest costs for its U.S. and material international pension and other postretirement benefits. For 2016, the Company elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans liability cash flows. The Company believes this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. For 2015, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The change in approach did not affect the measurement of the Companys plan obligations or the funded status. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis.
The expected long-term rate of return used for the U.S. plans is based on the pension plans asset mix. The Company considers expected long-term real returns on asset categories, expectations for inflation, and estimates of the impact of active management of the assets in coming to the final rate to use. The Company also considers actual historical returns.
The expected long-term rate of return used for the Companys international plans is determined in each local jurisdiction and is based on the assets held in that jurisdiction, the expected rate of returns for the type of assets held and any guaranteed rate of return provided by the investment. The other assumptions used to measure the international pension obligations, including discount rate, vary by country based on specific local requirements and information. As previously noted, the measurement date for these plans is November 30.
The Company uses most recently available mortality tables as of the respective U.S. and international measurement dates.
For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December31, 2016, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2023 and remain at those levels thereafter. Health care costs for certain employees which are eligible for subsidy by the Company are limited by a cap on the subsidy.
During the third quarter of 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors approved moving the U.S. postretirement healthcare plans to a Retiree Exchange approach, rather than the Employee Group Waiver Plan plus Wrap program, for post-65 retiree medical coverage beginning in 2018, and the Company informed all eligible legacy Ecolab and legacy Nalco retirees of the change. As a result of the approval and communication to the beneficiaries, the Ecolab and Nalco plans were re-measured, resulting in a $50 million reduction of postretirement benefit obligations, with a corresponding impact to AOCI of $31 million, net of tax. The remeasurement was completed using discount rates of 3.29% and 3.60%, respectively. Additionally, at the time of this remeasurement, the Nalco U.S. postretirement health care plan was merged with the Ecolab U.S. postretirement health care plan. As a result of these actions, the Companys U.S. postretirement health care costs decreased by $5 million in 2016.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the Companys U.S. postretirement health care benefits plan. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 1-PercentagePoint (millions) Increase Decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components $ - $ - Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 0.7 (0.7) Plan Asset Management The Companys U.S. investment strategy and policies are designed to maximize the possibility of having sufficient funds to meet the long-term liabilities of the pension fund, while achieving a balance between the goals of asset growth of the plan and keeping risk at a reasonable level. Current income is not a key goal of the policy.
The asset allocation position reflects the Companys ability and willingness to accept relatively more short-term variability in the performance of the pension plan portfolio in exchange for the expectation of better long-term returns, lower pension costs and better funded status in the long run. The pension fund is diversified across a number of asset classes and securities. Selected individual portfolios within the asset classes may be undiversified while maintaining the diversified nature of total plan assets. The Company has no significant concentration of risk in its U.S. plan assets.
Assets of funded retirement plans outside the U.S. are managed in each local jurisdiction and asset allocation strategy is set in accordance with local rules, regulations and practice. Therefore, no overall target asset allocation is presented. Although non-U.S. equity securities are all considered international for the Company, some equity securities are considered domestic for the local plan. The funds are invested in a variety of equities, bonds and real estate investments and, in some cases, the assets are managed by insurance companies which may offer a guaranteed rate of return. The Company has no significant concentration of risk in its international plan assets.
The fair value hierarchy is used to categorize investments measured at fair value in one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. This categorization is based on the observability of the inputs used in valuing the investments. See Note 7 for definitions of these levels.
85 Table of Contents In 2016, the Company adopted the updated accounting guidance that removes the requirement to categorize all investments within the fair value hierarchy for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share (NAV) as a practical expedient and requires the presentation of the carrying amount of investments measured using the NAV as a reconciling item between the total amount of investments categorized within the fair value hierarchy and total investments measured at fair value. Investments valued at NAV include hedge funds and private equity, valued based on the NAV of the underlying partnerships, whose investments are based at fair value. Investments at NAV also include real estate funds, valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the securities. The fair value measurement tables presented below have been updated to follow the new guidance.
The fair value of the Companys U.S. plan assets for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care benefit plans are as follows: Fair Value as of Fair Value as of (millions) December31, 2016 December31, 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Cash $ 6.3 $ 6.3 $ 6.9 $ 6.9 Equity securities: Large cap equity 696.0 696.0 660.5 660.5 Small cap equity 179.0 179.0 184.2 184.2 International equity 293.4 293.4 247.4 247.4 Fixed income: Core fixed income 351.5 351.5 336.5 336.5 High-yield bonds 107.6 107.6 86.7 86.7 Emerging markets 33.5 33.5 27.1 27.1 Insurance company accounts - $ 0.3 0.3 - $ 0.3 0.3 Total investments at fair value 1,667.3 0.3 1,667.6 1,549.3 0.3 1,549.6 Investments measured at NAV 292.1 232.3 Total $ 1,667.3 $ 0.3 $ 1,959.7 $ 1,549.3 $ 0.3 $ 1,781.9 The Company had no level 3 assets as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.

The Company is currently in compliance with all funding requirements of its U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans. In April of 2016, the Company made a $150 million voluntary contribution to its non-contributory qualified U.S. pension plan. No voluntary contributions were made to the U.S. pension plan during 2015 and 2014.
The Company is required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. The Company estimates contributions to be made to its international plans will approximate $42 million in 2017.
The Company seeks to maintain an asset balance that meets the long-term funding requirements identified by the projections of the pension plans actuaries while simultaneously satisfying the fiduciary responsibilities prescribed in ERISA. The Company also takes into consideration the tax deductibility of contributions to the benefit plans.
87 Table of Contents The Company is not aware of any expected refunds of plan assets within the next twelve months from any of its existing U.S. or international pension or postretirement benefit plans.
Savings Plan and ESOP The Company provides a 401(k)savings plan for the majority of its U.S. employees under the Companys two main 401(k) savings plans, the Ecolab Savings Plan and ESOP for Traditional Benefit Employees (the Traditional Plan) and the Ecolab Savings Plan and ESOP (the Ecolab Plan).
Employees under the Traditional Plan are limited to active employees accruing a final average pay or 5% cash balance benefits in the Ecolab Pension Plan. Employee before-tax contributions made under the Traditional Plan of up to 3% of eligible compensation are matched 100% by the Company and employee before-tax contributions over 3% and up to 5% of eligible compensation are matched 50% by the Company.
Employees under the Ecolab Plan are limited to active employees accruing benefits under the 3% cash balance formula of the Ecolab Pension Plan and employees of Nalco eligible for certain legacy final average pay benefits. Employee before-tax contributions made under the Ecolab Plan of up to 4% of eligible compensation are matched 100% by the Company and employee before-tax contributions over 4% and up to 8% of eligible compensation are matched 50% by the Company.
The Companys matching contributions are 100% vested immediately. The Companys matching contribution expense was $74 million and $72 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
17. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION The Companys organizational structure consists of global business unit and global regional leadership teams. The Companys ten operating segments follow its commercial and product-based activities and are based on engagement in business activities, availability of discrete financial information and review of operating results by the Chief Operating Decision Maker at the identified operating segment level.
Eight of the Companys ten operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics and future prospects, nature of the products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and regulatory environment. The Companys reportable segments are Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Global Energy. The Companys two operating segments that are primarily fee-for-service businesses have been combined into the Other segment and do not meet the quantitative criteria to be separately reported. The Company provides similar information for the Other segment as compared to its three reportable segments as the Company considers the information regarding its two underlying operating segments as useful in understanding its consolidated results.
The Companys ten operating segments are aggregated as follows: Global Industrial Includes the Water, Food & Beverage, Paper and Textile Care operating segments. It provides water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions primarily to large industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, chemical, mining and primary metals, power generation, pulp and paper, and commercial laundry industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics.
Global Institutional Includes the Institutional, Specialty and Healthcare operating segments. It provides specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, healthcare, government and education and retail industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics.
Global Energy Includes the Energy operating segment. It serves the process chemicals and water treatment needs of the global petroleum and petrochemical industries in both upstream and downstream applications.
Other Includes the Pest Elimination and Equipment Care operating segments, which provide pest elimination and kitchen repair and maintenance.
88 Table of Contents Comparability of Reportable Segments The Company evaluates the performance of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Fixed currency rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all Venezuela bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of the Companys Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar.
Reportable Segment Information Financial information for each of the Companys reportable segments is as follows: Net Sales Operating Income (Loss) (millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Global Industrial $ 4,617.1 $ 4,485.5 $ 4,261.9 $ 703.0 $ 626.4 $ 538.8 Global Institutional 4,495.6 4,210.9 3,982.8 966.7 876.6 772.6 Global Energy 3,035.8 3,470.8 3,815.8 337.1 465.5 534.8 Other 806.5 747.1 705.2 148.1 127.5 109.9 Corporate - - - (272.1) (663.8) (252.4) Subtotal at fixed currency 12,955.0 12,914.3 12,765.7 1,882.8 1,432.2 1,703.7 Effect of foreign currency translation 197.8 630.8 1,514.8 32.2 129.1 251.3 Consolidated $ 13,152.8 $ 13,545.1 $ 14,280.5 $ 1,915.0 $ 1,561.3 $ 1,955.0 The profitability of the Companys operating segments is evaluated by management based on operating income. The Company has no intersegment revenues.
Consistent with the Companys internal management reporting, Corporate amounts in the table above include intangible asset amortization specifically from the Nalco merger and special (gains) and charges, as discussed in Note 3, that are not allocated to the Companys reportable segments.
The Company has an integrated supply chain function that serves all of its reportable segments. As such, asset and capital expenditure information by reportable segment has not been provided and is not available, since the Company does not produce or utilize such information internally. In addition, although depreciation and amortization expense is a component of each reportable segments operating results, it is not discretely identifiable.
Sales of warewashing products were approximately 11% and 10% of consolidated net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. No class of products was 10% or more of consolidated net sales in 2014.
The majority of the Companys revenue is driven by the sale of its chemical products, with any corresponding service generally considered incidental to the product sale. The exception to this is the Pest Elimination and Equipment Care operating segments, which are within the Other segment and as previously noted, are primarily fee-for-service businesses. In addition, the Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Global Energy reportable segments derive a small amount of revenue directly from service offerings.
Total service revenue at public exchange rates by reportable segment is shown below.
