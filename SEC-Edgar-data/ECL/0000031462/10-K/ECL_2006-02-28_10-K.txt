Item 1. Business .
Item 1(a) General Development of Business .
Ecolab was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1924. Our fiscal year is the calendar year ending December 31.
Effective January 2004, we reorganized our businesses serving the janitorial and health care industries by splitting the Professional Products group into two divisions, Professional Products and Healthcare.
During 2004 and early 2005, we continued to make business acquisitions to broaden our product and service offerings, in line with our Circle the Customer  Circle the Globe strategy. These transactions included the following:  In January 2004, we expanded our Pest Elimination business into France by acquiring Nigiko, a Paris-based business.
In February 2004, we acquired Daydots International, a provider of food safety products.
In May 2004, we purchased Elimco (Proprietary) Limited, a Pest Elimination business located in South Africa.
In June 2004, we purchased certain business lines of VIC International Corporation, a stone floor cleaner business.
In July 2004, we acquired Alcide Corporation, a producer of biocidal and sanitation products used primarily in the dairy, meat and poultry industries.
In January 2005, we acquired Associated Chemicals & Services, Inc. (a/k/a Midland Research), a water treatment business.
During 2004, we disposed of certain non-strategic businesses that did not fit our long-term global strategy.
In April 2004, we sold a grease management product line, Facilitec, which provided kitchen hood and duct cleaning services.
In September 2004, we divested assets of Hygiene Services, a small New Zealand based business.
Additional details regarding certain of the above acquisition and disposition transactions are found in Note 6 located on pages 39 and 40 of the Annual Report, and incorporated into Item 8 hereof.
Item 1(b) Financial Information About Operating Segments .
The financial information about reportable segments appearing under the heading Operating Segments in Note 16, located on pages 48 and 49 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
3 Item 1(c) Narrative Description of Business .
General: Ecolab develops and markets premium products and services for the hospitality, foodservice, institutional and industrial markets. We provide cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products, systems and services primarily to hotels and restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, quick-service (fast-food and other convenience store) units, grocery stores, commercial and institutional laundries, light industry, dairy plants and farms, food and beverage processors, pharmaceutical and cosmetics facilities and the vehicle wash industry. A strong commitment to customer support is a distinguishing characteristic of our business. Additional information on our business philosophy is found below under the heading Additional Information  Competition of this Item 1(c).
The following description of business is based upon our three reportable segments (segments) as reported in our consolidated financial statements. However, we pursue a Circle the Customer  Circle the Globe strategy by providing products, systems and services which serve our customer base, and do so on a global basis to meet the needs of our customers various operations around the world. Therefore, one customer may utilize the services of all three of the segments and there is a degree of interdependence among the operating segments. Revenues of our International segment include sales outside the United States by our Kay and Pest Elimination businesses.
United States Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment The United States Cleaning & Sanitizing segment is comprised of eight divisions which provide cleaning and sanitizing services to United States markets.
Institutional : Our Institutional Division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (warewashing), for on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and health care customers) and for general housekeeping functions, as well as food safety products and equipment, dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry. The Institutional Division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for commercial and hospitality customers. The Institutional Division also manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems, which are made available to customers, to dispense our cleaners and sanitizers. In addition, the Institutional Division markets a program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance.
We believe we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products to institutions in the United States.
The Institutional Division sells its products and services primarily through Company-employed field sales-and-service personnel. However, to a significant degree, we also utilize independent, third-party foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors. We provide the same service to accounts supplied by food distributors as to direct customers.
Kay : Our Kay Division (which consists of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ecolab Inc.) supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to the quick-service restaurant industry. This includes traditional fast-food restaurants but also other retail locations where fast food is prepared and served, such as convenience stores, airport and shopping center kiosks and other public venues typically serviced by national or regional restaurant chains. Kay also sells cleaning and sanitizing products to the food retail (i.e., grocery store) industry. Kays products include specialty 4 and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools. Products are sold under the Kay brand or the customers private label. In addition, Kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers. Kays customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels, cleaning performance, equipment life and safety levels.
Kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quick-service restaurant and food retail chains and franchisees, although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisees units.
We believe that our Kay Division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick-service restaurant industry in the United States. While Kays customer base has been growing, Kays business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quick-service restaurant chains and franchisees. Kay continues to seek growth and diversification opportunities. For example, in 2004 Kay launched a cleaning program for theaters.
Food & Beverage : Our Food & Beverage Division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the start of the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption. The Division provides detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products, primarily to dairy plants, dairy farms, breweries, soft-drink bottling plants, and meat, poultry and other food processors as well as to pharmaceutical and cosmetic plants. The Food & Beverage Division also designs, engineers and installs CIP (clean-in-place) process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base. Farm products are sold through dealers and independent, third-party distributors, while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel.
We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy farm, food, meat and poultry, and beverage/brewery processor industries in the United States.
Textile Care : Our Textile Care Division provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems, as well as related services, to large industrial and commercial laundries. Typically these customers process a minimum of 1,000,000 pounds of linen each year and include free-standing laundry plants used by institutions such as hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities as well as industrial and textile rental laundries. The Division also serves the shirt laundry market, typically comprised of smaller laundry units. Products and services include laundry cleaning and specialty products and related dispensing equipment, which are marketed primarily through a Company-employed sales force and, to a lesser extent, through independent, third-party distributors. The Divisions programs are designed to meet our customers need for exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the customers overall operating cost.
Professional Products: The Professional Products Division provides a broad range of janitorial offerings to the janitorial market and building service contractors in the United States. Professional Products proprietary janitorial products (detergents, general purpose cleaners, carpet care, furniture polishes, disinfectants, floor care products, hand soaps and odor counteractants) are sold primarily through a network of independent, third-party distributors, supported by a Company-employed sales force.
5 Healthcare : Formerly part of our Professional Products business, our Healthcare Division provides infection prevention and healthcare offerings to hospital, acute care and long-term care markets in the United States. Healthcares proprietary infection prevention/healthcare products (skin care, disinfectants and instrument cleaners) are sold primarily under the Huntington brand name.
Vehicle Care: Our Vehicle Care Division provides vehicle appearance products which include soaps, polishes, wheel and tire treatments and air fresheners. Products are sold to vehicle rental, fleet and consumer car wash and detail operations. Brand names utilized by the Vehicle Care Division include Blue Coral  , Black Magic  and Rain-X  .
Water Care Services : Water Care Services provides water and wastewater treatment products, services and systems for commercial/institutional customers (full service hotels, cruise ships, hospitals, healthcare, commercial real estate, government, and commercial laundries), food and beverage customers (dairies, meat, poultry, food processing and beverage) and other light industry. Water Care Services works closely with the our Institutional, Textile Care and Food & Beverage Divisions to offer customized water care strategies to their accounts that have water care needs, primarily to treat water used in heating and cooling systems and manufacturing processes and to treat wastewater.
United States Other Services Segment The United States Other Services segment is comprised of two business units: Pest Elimination and GCS Service. In general, these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business customers as a part of our Circle the Customer approach.
Pest Elimination : Our Pest Elimination Division provides services for the detection, elimination and prevention of pests to restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick-service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers. These services are sold and performed by Company-employed sales and service personnel. In addition, through our EcoSure Food Safety Management business, the Division provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations.
GCS Service : GCS Service provides commercial equipment repair services and kitchen parts, as well as parts distribution. GCS Service offers these services to restaurant and other foodservice operations, while providing warranty service for equipment manufacturers. In addition, GCS Service offers parts at a wholesale level to repair services companies and end users.
International Segment We conduct business in approximately 70 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in the case of Israel and Venezuela, through majority-owned joint ventures with local partners. In other countries, selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues. Our largest International operations are located in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada, with smaller operations in Africa and the Middle East.
In general, the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the United States, although we customize our products and services to meet unique local requirements. The businesses which are similar to the United States Institutional and Food & Beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our International operations. They are conducted in virtually all our 6 International locations and, compared to the United States, constitute a larger portion of the overall business. Kay also has sales in a number of International locations. A significant portion of Kays international sales are to international units of United States-based quick-service restaurant chains. Consequently, a substantial portion of Kays international sales are made either to domestic or internationally-located third-party distributors who serve these chains.
Through acquisitions we expanded our Pest Elimination business to Brazil in 2001, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in September 2002, to France and South Africa in 2004, and to Chile in early 2005. In addition, we entered the healthcare market in the United Kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in December 2002.
Our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our International locations. However, in general, most of the principal businesses conducted in the United States are operated in Canada.
International businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad. The profitability of our International operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the United States. This has been due to the smaller scale of the International operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions.
Additional Information Competition : Our business units have two significant classes of competitors. First, each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-user segments.
Our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets. In general, competition is based on service, product performance and price. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value and differentiated products. Value is provided by state-of-the-art cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction. This is made possible, in part, by our significant on-going investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and comply with safety, environmental and sanitation regulations. In addition, we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services to our customers and to provide that level of service to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide. This approach is succinctly stated in our Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe strategy which is discussed above in this Item 1(c) under the heading General.
Sales and Service : Products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained sales and service personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs. Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets, as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above.
Number of Employees : We have approximately 21,300 employees.
Customers and Classes of Service : We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although, as described above in this Item 1(c) under the description of the Kay business, Kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick-service 7 chains and franchisees. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit. We sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales. Sales of warewashing products in 2004, 2003 and 2002 approximated 22, 23 and 23 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. In addition, through our Institutional and Textile Care businesses, we sell laundry products and services to a broad range of laundry customers. Sales of laundry products and services in 2004, 2003 and 2002 approximated 10, 10 and 11 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
Patents and Trademarks : We own and license a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through a license agreement with Henkel KGaA. While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks, and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.
Seasonality : Overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality.
Working Capital : We have invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products. Otherwise, we have no unusual working capital requirements. The investment in merchandising equipment is discussed under the heading Cash Flows located on page 28 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 7 hereof.
Manufacturing and Distribution : We manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-owned manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for us by third-party contract manufacturers, including Henkel KGaA. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 14 hereof under the heading Properties.
Deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses. We use common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors. Additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 14 hereof under the heading Properties.
Raw Materials : Raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including phosphates, silicates, alkalies, salts and organic chemicals, including surfactants and solvents. These materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers. When practical, global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels. Pesticides used by our Pest Elimination Division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. Most raw materials, or substitutes for those materials, used by us, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture, are available from several suppliers.
8 Research and Development : Our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel. At times, technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings. Note 13, entitled Research Expenditures located on page 44 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
Environmental and Regulatory Considerations : Our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances, waste disposal or plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls. Additionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below.
Ingredient Legislation : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity to date.
Pesticide Legislation : Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on environmental surfaces and on certain food products. Such products constitute pesticides or antimicrobial pesticides under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain approximately 400 product registrations with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that State. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or the results of our operations to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products have increased in recent years. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations, and for the California tax, were 9 approximately $2,700,000 in 2004 and $2,400,000 in 2003. In Europe, the Biocidal Product Directive (98/8/EC) is establishing a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products. The Biocidal Product Directive requirements are transitioning into effect. In September 2006, certain biocidal active substances not notified to the European Chemicals Bureau will be withdrawn from the market. We are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the Biocidal Products Directive. Anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
In addition, our Pest Elimination Division applies restricted-use pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties. That Division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements.
FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals, processed foods, and medical devices. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations in a Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products dated June 17, 1994 that may impose additional requirements and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. To date, such requirements have not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Other Environmental Legislation : Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of toxic substances into the air, land and water. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects were approximately $1,810,000 in 2004 and $1,800,000 in 2003. Approximately $5,900,000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2005.
Environmental Remediation and Proceedings : Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (PRPs), we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or state equivalents at approximately 20 sites in the United States. Additionally, we have similar liability at eight sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP which actually contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning 10 up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Pursuant to an Environmental Agreement dated December 7, 2000 with Henkel KGaA, Henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the parties former joint venture in Europe. Reimbursement from Henkel has been requested for 42,785 euro (or approximately $55,000) spent for such environmental liabilities prior to December 31, 2004.
Based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.
Our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $500,000 in 2004 and $500,000 in 2003. Including the ChemLawn matters described below, our worldwide accruals at December 31, 2004 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately $4,100,000. We review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former ChemLawn business is a PRP. Currently there are five such locations and, at each, ChemLawn is a de minimis party. Anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued ChemLawn operations in 1991. The accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs.

Item 2. Properties .
Our manufacturing philosophy is to manufacture products wherever an economic, process or quality assurance advantage exists or where proprietary manufacturing techniques dictate internal production processes. Currently, most products sold by us are manufactured at our facilities.
Our manufacturing facilities produce chemical products or equipment for all of our businesses, although the businesses constituting the United States Other Services segment purchase the majority of their products and equipment from outside suppliers. Our chemical production process consists primarily of blending and packaging powders and liquids and casting solids. Our equipment manufacturing operations consist primarily of producing chemical product dispensers and injectors and other mechanical equipment and dishwasher racks and related sundries.
The following chart profiles our main manufacturing facilities with ongoing production activities. In general, manufacturing facilities located in the United States serve the United States Cleaning & Sanitizing segment and facilities located outside of the United States serve the International segment. However, certain of the United States facilities do manufacture products for export and which are used by the International segment. The facilities having export involvement are marked with an asterisk(*).

In the United States, our sales and service associates are located in approximately 60 leased offices. Additional sales offices are located internationally.
Our corporate headquarters is comprised of three adjacent multi-storied buildings located in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.

In April 2004, we purchased a 90 acre campus in Eagan, Minnesota to provide for future growth. At the outset, the new facility will primarily serve our new research and development and data center needs. Renovations of the buildings on this property, comprising approximately 500,000 square feet, are currently underway. Our current research center in Mendota Heights, Minnesota and the data center in St. Paul are expected to be sold in 2005.

Item 9B. Other Information .
The following disclosures would otherwise be filed on Form 8-K under the heading Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement .
In the paragraphs below describing our executive compensation and non-employee director plans and programs, the Named Executive Officers or NEOs refer to one or both (as indicated by the context) of the individuals who served as our Chief Executive Officer during 2004 (Allan L. Schuman was in the CEO position from January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2004, and Douglas M. Baker, Jr. from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004) and the next four most-highly compensated executive officers who were serving in those capacities at December 31, 2004, and the Committee refers to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
19 General The components of the overall compensation program for the Companys executive officers include base salary, long-term incentives in the form of annual stock option awards, cash-based annual bonus incentives, participation in deferred compensation and retirement plans, and certain perquisites. A summary of the executive compensation program is filed as Exhibit (10)U to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference.
Base Salary For the 2005 fiscal year, base salaries for corporate officers, including the NEOs other than the CEO, are scheduled to increase by an average of 4.2%. The salary of Douglas M. Baker, Jr. was increased to $700,000, effective upon his promotion to CEO on July 1, 2004, and was not further adjusted for 2005. Competitive market data is available for all of the executive positions. Salaries are monitored to ensure that the appropriate balance of internal value and external competitiveness is maintained. The base salaries established for the 2005 fiscal year for the NEOs are included as a part of the Named Executive Officer Salary, Stock Options and Bonus Table (the NEO Table) filed as Exhibit (10)T to this Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.
Long-Term Incentive Awards For the 2005 fiscal year, long-term incentive stock options were granted to the corporate officers, including the NEOs other than the CEO, for an aggregate of 678,000 shares. The CEO received a grant for 314,000 shares. Individual stock incentive grant guidelines are established for each such officer based on market competitive values. Guidelines were developed on a position-by-position basis using market data from the Towers Perrin Single Regression and Long-Term Incentive surveys for general industry companies. The market data represents median long-term incentive values adjusted for size based on revenue. The guidelines were reviewed and approved by the Committees independent consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co. The stock options granted for the 2005 fiscal year for the NEOs are included in the NEO Table and incorporated by reference herein. The options were granted in December 2004 pursuant to a form of agreement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and were timely reported to the SEC on Forms 4.
Bonuses On February 25, 2005, the Committee authorized the payment of annual incentive awards (bonuses) under our Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and Management Performance Incentive Plan (MPIP) with respect to fiscal 2004 performance. The MIP is a cash-based annual incentive plan that focuses executives attention on achieving competitive annual business goals. For fiscal 2004, performance goals were based principally on diluted earnings per share and business unit operating income and revenue goals, with the relative weighting of these goals varying by executive position. Target award opportunities during 2004 for corporate officers, including the NEOs other than the CEOs, ranged from 35% to 60% of base salary, with threshold and maximum award opportunities at 40% and 200% of target opportunities, respectively. Based on overall Company, business unit and individual performance for the most recent fiscal year, actual award payments for such corporate officers were $4,374,200 in the aggregate and ranged individually from 132% to 200% of target opportunities (except 254% for one officer, reflecting a discretionary increase by the Committee for successful completion of a special project).
20 The MPIP is a stockholder approved plan that is similar to the MIP, except that it is intended to qualify for the performance-based exception to the $1,000,000 deduction limitation under Section162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. For fiscal 2004, the Committee selected the CEOs and two other executive officers as participants in the MPIP and established a maximum award payment opportunity equal to 300% of each participants base salary (subject to a limit of $3,000,000) based on the attainment of pre-established diluted earnings per share goals. The Committee, working with management and the Companys independent compensation consultants, also set performance goals for the Company which are in addition to the MPIP performance goals. The bonuses paid for the 2004 fiscal year for the NEOs under the MIP and MPIP are included in the NEO Table and incorporated by reference herein.
The Company intends to provide additional information regarding the compensation awarded to the Named Executive Officers in respect of and during the year ended December 31, 2004 in the definitive proxy statement for the Companys 2005 annual meeting of stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or around March 30, 2005.
Establishment of 2005 Bonus Criteria On February 25, 2005, the Committee established the performance criteria for the MIP and the MPIP for the Companys fiscal year ending on December 31, 2005. Consistent with previous years, target award opportunities under the MIP for corporate officers, including the NEOs other than the Chief Executive Officer, will range from 35% to 60% of base salary, with threshold and maximum award opportunities at 40% and 200% of target opportunities, respectively. Sector heads and business unit general managers will continue to have 30% of their performance measured on earnings per share (EPS) performance and 70% on business unit objectives. The majority of corporate staff officers will have 70% of their award based on total EPS and 30% on total division operating income. The Committee also selected the CEO and the President-Industrial Sector as the participants for the MPIP for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2005. The performance goal for the participants in the MPIP will be diluted EPS, with the maximum award payment opportunity equal to 300% of the applicable participants base salary (subject to the plan limit of $3 million) if the performance is achieved.
Amendment of Management Performance Incentive Plan On February 25, 2005 the Committee recommended and the Board approved an amendment to the MPIP in response to section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The guidance for Code section 409A provides that compensation paid to a service provider within 2 months of the later of (i) the end of the taxable year of the service provider or (ii) the end of the taxable year of the service recipient, is not considered a deferral of compensation, and therefore not subject to Code section 409A. The amendment to the MPIP provides that all payments under the plan will be made within 2 months of the end of the Companys fiscal year, and therefore no payments under the plan would be subject to Code section 409A. A copy of the amendment to the MPIP is filed as Exhibit (10)O(ii) to this Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.
21 Non-Employee Director Compensation The components of the overall compensation program for the Companys non-employee directors include an annual retainer, Committee Chair fees, deferred stock units, an annual stock option grant, gift matching, travel insurance, and certain director liability protection. A summary of the non-employee director compensation program is filed as Exhibit (10)V to this Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated by reference.
