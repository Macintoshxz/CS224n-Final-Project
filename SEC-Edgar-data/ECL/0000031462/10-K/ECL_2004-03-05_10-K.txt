PART I Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In this Report on Form 10-K (including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations incorporated into Item 7 hereof), Management discusses expectations regarding future performance of the Company which include anticipated business progress and expansion, business acquisitions, debt repayments, susceptibility to changes in technology, global economic conditions and liquidity requirements. Without limiting the foregoing, words or phrases such as will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, we believe, estimate, project (including the negative or variations thereof) or similar terminology, generally identify forward-looking statements. Additionally, the Company may refer to this section of the Form 10-K to identify risk factors related to other forward looking statements made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public.
Forward-looking statements represent challenging goals for the Company. As such, they are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company cautions that undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date made. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company hereby identifies important factors which could affect the Companys financial performance and could cause the Companys actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements.
Risks and uncertainties that may affect operating results and business performance include: the vitality of the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries; restraints on pricing flexibility due to competitive factors and customer and vendor consolidations; changes in oil or raw material prices or unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials; the occurrence of capacity constraints or the loss of a key supplier; the effect of future acquisitions or divestitures or other corporate transactions; the Companys ability to achieve plans for past acquisitions; the costs and effects of complying with: (i) laws and regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, efficacy and labeling of the Companys products, and (ii) changes in tax, fiscal, governmental and other regulatory policies; economic factors such as the worldwide economy, interest rates, and currency movements including, in particular, the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk; the occurrence of (a) litigation or claims, (b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c) war, (d) natural or manmade disasters (including material acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact the Companys markets) and (e) severe weather conditions 2 affecting the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries; loss of, or changes in, executive management; the Companys ability to continue product introductions and technological innovations; and other uncertainties or risks reported from time to time in the Companys reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Company notes that its stock price can be affected by fluctuations in quarterly earnings. There can be no assurances that the Companys earnings levels will meet investors expectations.
Item 1 . Business Item 1(a) General Development of Business Except where the context otherwise requires, the terms Company and Ecolab, as used herein, include Ecolab Inc. and its subsidiaries. Ecolab Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1924. The Companys fiscal year is the calendar year ending December 31.
On November 30, 2001, the Company acquired the 50 percent of the Henkel-Ecolab joint venture (Henkel-Ecolab) which the Company did not previously own (the JV Acquisition), from its joint venture partner, Henkel KGaA, Dsseldorf, Germany (Henkel).
Prior to the JV Acquisition, the Company accounted for its interest in Henkel-Ecolab under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the JV Acquisition, the legal entities constituting Henkel-Ecolab became wholly-owned entities of the Company. Following the JV Acquisition, the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Henkel-Ecolab are reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as a part of the Companys International Cleaning & Sanitizing reportable segment.
Financial statements of Henkel-Ecolab, in respect of certain periods prior to the November 30, 2001 date of the JV Acquisition as listed under Item 15.I(3) of Part IV hereof, are included as a part of this Report and a review of Henkel-Ecolab financial performance is found under the heading Henkel-Ecolab contained in the Financial Discussion which is incorporated from the Annual Report into Item 7 hereof.
During 2002, the Company continued to make business acquisitions which broadened its product and service offerings in line with its Circle the Customer  Circle the Globe strategy.
In January 2002, the Company acquired certain operations of Kleencare Hygiene located in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. These operations provide products, systems and services for the food and beverage industry. This acquisition represented the Companys first step following the JV Acquisition to leverage and expand its wholly-owned operations in Europe.
In January 2002, the Company also purchased Audits International, a Chicago, Illinois-based provider of food safety services in the United States.
In April 2002, the Company acquired a 20% interest in Central Ankoff FNZ Holding B.V., located in the Netherlands. CA FNZ is the Companys local distributor in the food processing and farm sector marketplace.
In September 2002, the Company expanded its pest elimination business to Europe by purchasing Terminix Limited, a London-based provider of commercial pest elimination and property services throughout the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
3 In November 2002, the Company entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Intralytix, Inc. to market a technology to control food-borne pathogens in the food and beverage industry. In addition, the Company made a loan to Intralytix and, if certain milestones are achieved by November 2004, the Company would be obligated to purchase certain Common Stock and Common Stock warrants of Intralytix.
In November 2002, the Company acquired certain assets, including a manufacturing plant of ARAMARK Management Services, which provided specialty chemicals for the foodservice industry.
In December 2002, the Company entered the hospital hygiene market in the United Kingdom by acquiring the Adams Healthcare business of Medical Solutions plc.
In 2002, the Company completed two business divestment transactions. In August, the Company sold its 50% interest in Dairy Partners LLC, a joint venture that operates a dairy farm distribution business. The Company sold its interest to its joint venture partner, Dairy Farmers of America. In December, the Company sold its Darenas janitorial products distribution business based in Birmingham, U.K. to Bunzl plc of London, U.K.
Additional details of certain of these transactions are found under the heading Other Business Acquisitions and Divestitures in Note6, located on pages 38 and 39 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 8 hereof.
Item 1(b) Financial Information About Operating Segments The financial information about reportable segments appearing under the heading Operating Segments in Note 16, located on pages 46 and 47 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1(c) Narrative Description of Business General: The Company is engaged in the development and marketing of premium products and services for the hospitality, institutional and industrial markets. The Company provides cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products, systems and services primarily to hotels and restaurants, foodservice, healthcare and educational facilities, quick-service (fast food and other convenience store) units, grocery stores, commercial and institutional laundries, light industry, dairy plants and farms, food and beverage processors, pharmaceutical and cosmetics facilities and the vehicle wash industry. A strong commitment to customer support is a distinguishing characteristic of the Company. Additional information on the Companys business philosophy is found below under the heading Additional Information  Competition of this Item 1(c).
The following description of business is based upon the Companys three reportable segments (segments) as reported in the Companys consolidated financial statements. However, the Company pursues a Circle the Customer  Circle the Globe strategy by providing products, systems and services which serve the Companys customer base, and does so on a global basis to meet the needs of its customers various operations around the world. Therefore, one customer may utilize the services of all three of the segments and there is a degree of interdependence among the operating segmentsparticularly between the International Cleaning & Sanitizing and the United States Cleaning & Sanitizing businesses.
4 United States Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment The United States Cleaning & Sanitizing segment is comprised of seven divisions which provide cleaning and sanitizing services to United States markets.
Institutional : The Institutional Division is the Companys largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (warewashing), for on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and health care customers) and for general housekeeping functions, as well as dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry. The Institutional Division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for commercial and hospitality customers and, through its Facilitec business, provides rooftop grease filter products and kitchen exhaust cleaning services for restaurants and other foodservice operations. The Institutional Division also manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems, which are made available to customers, to dispense the Companys cleaners and sanitizers. In addition, the Institutional Division markets primarily to smaller and mid-size customer units, a program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance.
The Company believes it is the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products to institutions in the United States.
The Institutional Division sells its products and services primarily through Company-employed field sales-and-service personnel. However, the Company, to a significant degree, also utilizes independent, third-party foodservice distributors to market and sell its products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors. The Company provides the same service to accounts served by food distributors as to direct customers.
Kay : The Kay Division (which consists of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company) supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to the quick-service restaurant industry. This includes traditional fast food restaurants but also other retail locations where fast food is prepared and served, such as convenience stores, airport and shopping center kiosks and other public venues typically serviced by national or regional restaurant chains. Kay also sells cleaning and sanitizing products, to the food retail (i.e., grocery store) industry. Kays products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools. Products are sold under the Kay brand or the customers private label. In addition, Kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers. Kays customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels, cleaning performance, equipment life and safety levels.
Kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quick-service restaurant and food retail chains and franchisees, although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisees units.
The Company believes that its Kay Division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick-service restaurant industry in the United States. While Kays customer base has been growing, Kays business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quick-service restaurant chains and franchisees.
5 Food & Beverage : The Food & Beverage Division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the start of the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption. The Division provides detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products, primarily to dairy plants, dairy farms, breweries, soft-drink bottling plants, and meat, poultry and other food processors as well as to pharmaceutical and cosmetic plants. The division also markets food irradiation services through an alliance with Ion Beam Applications (IBA). The Food & Beverage Division also designs, engineers and installs CIP (clean-in-place) process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base. Farm products are sold through dealers and independent, third-party distributors, while plant products are sold primarily by the Companys field sales personnel.
The Company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy farm, food, meat and poultry, and beverage/brewery processor industries in the United States.
Textile Care : The Textile Care Division provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems, as well as related services, to large institutional and commercial laundries. Typically these customers process a minimum of 1,000,000 pounds of linen each year and include free-standing laundry plants used by institutions such as hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities as well as industrial and textile rental laundries. The Division also serves the shirt laundry market, typically comprised of smaller laundry units. Products and services include laundry cleaning and specialty products and related dispensing equipment, which are marketed primarily through a Company-employed sales force and, to a lesser extent, through independent, third-party distributors. The Divisions programs are designed to meet the customers need for exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the customers overall operating cost. Textile Care offerings complement the Institutional Divisions offerings to on-premise laundry facilities.
Professional Products: The Professional Products Division provides a broad range of janitorial and infection prevention/healthcare offerings to the janitorial and medical markets in the United States. Its proprietary janitorial products (detergents, general purpose cleaners, carpet care, furniture polishes, disinfectants, floor care products, hand soaps and odor counteractants) are sold primarily under the brand name Airkem, and proprietary infection prevention/healthcare products (skin care, disinfectants and instrument sterilants) are sold primarily under the Huntington brand name. These products are sold primarily through a network of independent, third-party distributors, supported by a Company-employed sales force.
The Division also sells certain specialty chemical products which are manufactured for third parties. These offerings include the manufacture of a small line of private label products and house brand products for third parties.
Vehicle Care: The Companys Vehicle Care Division provides vehicle appearance products which include soaps, polishes, wheel and tire treatments and air fresheners. Products are sold to vehicle rental, fleet and consumer car wash and detail operations. Brand names utilized by the Vehicle Care Division include Blue Coral  , Black Magic  and Rain-X  .
Water Care Services : Water Care Services supplements the Companys Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe strategy by offering water treatment programs that are critical to the Companys customer base. Water Care Services provides water and wastewater treatment products, services and systems for commercial/institutional customers (full service hotels, cruise ships, hospitals, 6 healthcare, commercial real estate, government, and commercial laundries), food and beverage customers (dairies, meat, poultry, food processing and beverage) and other light industry. Water Care Services works closely with the Companys Institutional, Textile Care and Food & Beverage Divisions to offer customized water care strategies to their accounts that have water care needs, primarily to treat water used in heating and cooling systems and manufacturing processes and to treat wastewater.
United States Other Services Segment The United States Other Services segment is comprised of two business units: Pest Elimination and GCS Service. In general, these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend the Companys product offering to its business customers as a part of the Circle the Customer approach.
Pest Elimination : The Pest Elimination Division provides services for the detection, elimination and prevention of pests to restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick-service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers. These services are sold and performed by Company-employed sales and service personnel. In addition, through its EcoSure Food Safety Management business, the Division provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations.
GCS Service : GCS provides commercial kitchen parts and equipment repair services including parts distribution. GCS offers these services to restaurant and other foodservice operations, while providing warranty service for equipment manufacturers. In addition, GCS offers parts at a wholesale level to repair services companies and end users.
International Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment The Company conducts business in approximately 70 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in the case of China, Israel and Venezuela, through majority-owned joint ventures with local partners. In other countries, selected products are sold by the Companys export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of the Companys overall revenues. The largest International operations are located in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada, with smaller operations in Africa.
In general, the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the United States, although the Company customizes its products and services to meet unique local requirements. The businesses which are similar to the United States Institutional and Food & Beverage businesses are the largest businesses in International operations. They are conducted in virtually all International locations and, compared to the United States, constitute a larger portion of the overall business. Kay also has sales in a number of International locations. A significant portion of its International sales are to international units of United States-based quick-service restaurant chains. Consequently, a substantial portion of Kays international sales are made either to domestic or internationally-located third-party distributors who serve these chains. The Company expanded its pest elimination business to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland by acquiring a London-based provider of commercial pest elimination services in September 2002. In addition, the Company entered the hospital hygiene market in the United Kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in December 2002. The Companys other businesses are conducted less extensively in International locations. However, in general, all of the businesses conducted in the United States are operated in Canada.
7 International businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad. The profitability of International operations has historically been lower than the profitability of businesses in the United States. This has been due to the smaller scale of International operations where several operating locations are smaller in size as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions.
Additional Information Competition : The Companys business units have two significant classes of competitors. First, each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, all of the Companys business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-user segments.
The Companys objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of its business markets. In general, competition is based on service, product performance and price. The Company believes it competes principally by providing superior value and differentiated products. Value is provided by state-of-the-art cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction. This is made possible, in part, by the Companys significant on-going investment in training and technology and by the Companys standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and comply with safety, environmental and sanitation regulations. In addition, the Company emphasizes its ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services to its customers and to provide that level of service to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide. This approach is succinctly stated in the Companys Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe strategy which is discussed above in this Item 1(c) under the heading General.
Sales and Service : Products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained sales and service personnel who also advise and assist customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs. Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets, as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above.
Customers and Classes of Service : The Company believes that its business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although, as described above in this Item 1(c) under the description of the Kay business, Kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick-service chains and franchisees. Additionally, although the Company has a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes ten percent or more of the Companys consolidated revenues, the Company does have customers and independent, third-party distributors (for example, ARAMARK, Sodexho, Sysco and U.S. Foodservice), the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, the Company considers it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company. No material part of the Companys business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit. The Company sells two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of its sales. Sales of warewashing products in 2002, 2001 and 2000 approximated 23, 26 and 26 percent, respectively, of the Companys consolidated net sales. In addition, the Company, through its Institutional and Textile Care businesses, sells laundry products and services to a broad range of laundry customers. Sales of 8 laundry products and services in 2002, 2001 and 2000 approximated 12, 10 and 11 percent, respectively, of the Companys consolidated net sales. Sales of the recently acquired Henkel-Ecolab operations are reflected in these percentages beginning in 2002.
Patents and Trademarks : The Company owns and licenses a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, including a license agreement with Henkel KGaA. While the Company has an active program to protect its intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks, and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, management does not believe that the Companys overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.
Seasonality : Overall the Companys business does not have a significant degree of seasonality.
Working Capital : The Company has invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense the Companys cleaning and sanitizing products. The Company, otherwise, has no unusual working capital requirements. The investment in merchandising equipment is discussed under the heading Cash Flows located on page 28 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 7 hereof.
Manufacturing and Distribution : The Company manufactures most of its products and related equipment in Company-owned manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for the Company by third-party contract manufacturers, including Henkel KGaA. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on the Companys manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 15 hereof under the heading Properties.
Deliveries to customers are made from the Companys manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses. The Company uses common carriers, its own delivery vehicles and distributors. Additional information on the Companys plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 15 hereof under the heading Properties.
Raw Materials : Raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing products for the Company are inorganic chemicals, including phosphates, silicates, alkalies, salts and organic chemicals, including surfactants and solvents. These materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers. Pesticides used by the Pest Elimination Division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. The Company also purchases packaging materials for its manufactured products and components for its specialized cleaning equipment and systems. Most raw materials, or substitutes for those materials, used by the Company, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which the Company manufactures, are available from several suppliers.
Research and Development : The Companys research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of the Companys principal products have been developed by its research, development and engineering personnel. At times, technology has also been licensed from outside the Company to develop offerings. Note 13, entitled Research Expenditures located on page 43 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
9 Environmental and Regulatory Considerations : This discussion of Environmental and Regulatory Considerations should be read in light of the Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors discussion found under Part I at the beginning of this Report. The Companys businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While the Company cooperates with governmental authorities and takes commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in the Companys businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with managing hazardous substances, waste disposal or plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if the Company were found in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls. Additionally, although the Company is not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to the Company are discussed below.
Ingredient Legislation: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. To date, the Company generally has been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material negative effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity to date.
Pesticide Legislation: Various federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. The Company manufactures and sells certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on environmental surfaces and on certain food products. Such products constitute pesticides or antimicrobial pesticides under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. The Company maintains approximately 400 product registrations with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that State. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity or the results of its operations to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products have increased in recent years. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations, and for the California tax, were approximately $2,500,000 in 2002 and $2,200,000 in 2001. Congress is evaluating legislation that would increase these fees. Absent such a change, anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
10 In addition, the Companys Pest Elimination Division applies restricted-use pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties. That Division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. The Company has not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements.
FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by the Company for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals, processed foods, and medical devices. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations in a Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products dated June 17, 1994 that may impose additional requirements and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. To date, such requirements have not had a material negative effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Other Environmental Legislation: The Companys manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to the Companys activities are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Company is also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of toxic substances into the air, land and water. The Company makes capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The Companys capital expenditures for environmental control projects were approximately $1,611,000 for 2002, $1,540,000 for 2001and approximately $1,480,000 has been budgeted for 2003.
Environmental Remediation and Proceedings : Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (PRPs), the Company is currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or state equivalents at approximately 18 sites in the United States. Additionally, the Company has similar liability at eight sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, the Company and each other PRP which actually contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.
Based on an analysis of the Companys experience with such environmental proceedings, the Companys estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and the Companys estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which the Company believes have the 11 financial ability to pay their shares, the Company has accrued its best estimate of the Companys probable future costs relating to such known sites. Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.
The Companys worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $500,000 in 2002 and $500,000 in 2001. Including the ChemLawn matters described below, the Companys worldwide accruals at December 31, 2002 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately $3,800,000. The Company reviews its exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and its accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, the Company believes the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In connection with the JV Acquisition, Ecolab and Henkel entered into an Environmental Agreement dated December 7, 2000 under which Henkel agreed to indemnify Ecolab for certain environmental liabilities associated with the former JV. As of December 31, 2002, Henkels outstanding reimbursement obligation to Ecolab for such environmental liabilities was 108,319 euro (or approximately $116,000). In addition, the Company has retained responsibility for certain sites where the Companys former ChemLawn business is a PRP. Currently there are five such locations and, at each, ChemLawn is a de minimis party. Anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in the Companys loss from its discontinued ChemLawn operations in 1991. The accrual remaining reflects managements best estimate of probable future costs.
Number of Employees : The Company currently has approximately 20,400 employees.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Henkel-Ecolab (the Company) is a leading European company providing total cleaning and hygiene systems and service solutions to institutional and industrial companies. See Basis of Presentation within Note 2 of the combined financial statements. The Companys offerings include detergents, sanitation cleaners, dosing and measuring equipment, cleaning machines, training and service. Customers include hotels and restaurants; food service, healthcare and educational facilities; commercial laundries; light industry; dairy plants and farms as well as food and beverage processors throughout Europe.
The Company was formed in 1991 by Henkel KGaA (Henkel) and Ecolab, Inc. (Ecolab) as a Company of their respective European institutional and industrial hygiene businesses. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Company Agreement dated June 26, 1991 (Company Agreement), Henkel and Ecolab have joint control over the activities of the Company. The Company Agreement also provides that both partners will share an equal economic interest in the profits or losses of the Company. On December 1, 2001, Ecolab purchased Henkels share of the Company. See note 10 of the combined financial statements.
Acquisitions and Divestiture The Company made certain acquisitions during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000; the aggregate impact of which was immaterial to the combined financial statements.
Waldhausen Divestiture : In June 2000, the Company divested the assets of the Floordress textile and equipment production facility in Waldhausen, Germany in two separate but related transactions for a price equal to the net book value of approximately TEUR 2,249. Inno Concept, the supplier of plastics to the plant, assumed responsibility of the textile and equipment production (including substantially all the employees and the current production building for textiles). The Company also entered into a long-term supply agreement for textiles and equipment with Inno Concept.Grupp, the metal supplier, purchased the equipment production building in a real-estate transaction. As both transactions were for a price equal to the net book value, no gain or loss was recorded on the books for the sale of the assets related to Waldhausen.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The financial statements are presented on a combined basis in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company is comprised of various entities. These entities have varying legal structures, including stock corporations, limited liability corporations and partnerships formed under the applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These entities are owned beneficially by identical shareholders or their wholly- owned subsidiaries and are, therefore, considered entities under common control. All significant intergroup or affiliated company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in combination. The Companys fiscal year end has been designated as November 30.
Adoption of New Currency Reporting Prior to 2001, the Company prepared and reported its combined financial statements in Deutsche Marks (DM). Beginning in 2001, the Company presented its combined financial statements in Euro (EUR). Accordingly figures for 2000 are shown in EUR using the Official Fixed Exchange Rate of 1 EUR = DM 1,95583. Henkel-Ecolabs 2000 Euro combined financial statements depict the same trends as would have been presented if it had continued to present its Combined Financial Statements in Deutsche Marks. The Companys Combined Financial Statements will however not be comparable to the Euro financial statements of other companies that previously reported their financial information in a currency other than Deutsche Marks.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first-in first-out and average cost methods.
42 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost. Merchandising equipment consists primarily of various systems for dispensing cleaning and sanitizing products. Depreciation and amortization are charged to operations using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Buildings and improvements up to 50 years Machinery and   equipment 3 to 10 years Furniture,   fixtures and merchandising equipment 3 to 8 years Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the associated lease. Betterments, renewals and repairs that extend the life of the asset are capitalized; other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed. The cost and accumulated depreciation/amortization applicable to the assets retired or disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income in the year of disposal.
Total depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment amounted to TEUR 37,766 and TEUR35,753 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets primarily consist of goodwill, capitalized software, concessions and licenses. These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, periods from 3 to 15 years. Total amortization expense for all intangible assets amounted to TEUR 8,676 and TEUR8,245 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company capitalizes purchased software which is ready for service and development costs incurred during the application development stage. These costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a maximum of three to five years or the expected life of the product, whichever is less. The carrying value of capitalized software costs are regularly reviewed by the Company and a loss is recognized if the unamortized cost is in excess of the net realizable value.
Long-Lived Assets The company periodically assesses the recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets based on anticipated future earnings and operating cash flows.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time title transfers to the customer. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time of sale.
43 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 Shipping and Handling Costs In connection with the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the Company has reclassified certain warehousing and transportation expenses from Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&A) to Cost of Sales. Amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2001 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position. Expenses reclassified from SG&A to Costs of Sales were TEUR 66,982 and TEUR 62,205 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The effect of the reclassification was to reduce gross margin by approximately 6.5 percentage points in each year and reduce SG&A as a percent of sales by a comparable amount.
Advertising Costs The Company expenses the costs of advertising in the period in which the costs are incurred. Advertising expenses were TEUR 21,696 and TEUR21,093 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Research expenditures Research expenditures which relate to the development of new products and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to existing products, approximately TEUR 20,000 and TEUR 18,900 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Upon adoption, the Company will also perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles as of December 1, 2001. The Company has not yet determined what impact the adoption of these statements will have on its results of operations and financial position.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the asset is placed in service. When the liability is initially recorded, entities capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, entities either settle the obligation for the recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with earlier adoption encouraged. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
44 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which replaces SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. The accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long-lived assets, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, for the disposal of segments of a business. This statement requires that those long-lived assets be measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. As a result, discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred. This statement also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company has entered into various contractual arrangements, including those discussed in the following paragraphs, for the supply of products, the performance of general and administrative services and the transfer of technology.
Certain Company entities purchase institutional and industrial hygiene products (primarily finished goods inventories) from Henkel and its subsidiaries under a variety of supply agreements. The terms of these agreements allow these entities to purchase specified quantities at agreed upon prices as defined by an annual supply plan submitted to the related manufacturing facility. Henkel also provides certain Company entities with elective services which include, but are not limited to, general administration, payroll administration, accounting and research and development. The costs of services are charged by Henkel on a monthly basis and may not reflect the costs which the Company would incur if it were necessary to procure such services from outside sources or if such services were performed internally by the Company. Related party purchases and fees incurred by the Company in consideration for these services totaled TEUR 92,155 and TEUR 91,278 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Royalty payments are shared equally by both parent companies based upon a technology transfer agreement which provides for a royalty payment 1 % of third party net sales as defined. Royalty expense related to this technology transfer agreement amounted to TEUR 7,670 and TEUR 7,455 for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The royalty agreement terminated effective December 1, 2001 when Ecolab acquired the 50% of the Company owned by Henkel.
The Company has entered into agreements with Henkel under which the Company can both borrow from and lend to Henkel both on an overdraft basis and through short term loans of no more than 3 months. There is currently no maximum level of borrowing specified under these agreements. The interest rate basis for both arrangements is the Euro London Interbank Offering Rate (EURO-LIBOR). At November 30, 2001, the interest rates were 4.875 % for EURO overdrafts and 3.53 % for 3 month short term EURO loans. On overdrafts, approximately 50 basis points are paid to compensate Henkel for administration costs. These agreements terminated effective December 1, 2001 when Ecolab acquired the 50% of the Company owned by Henkel At November 30, 2000 the Company had loans receivable from Henkel and its subsidiaries of TEUR 6,039. No loans remain outstanding as of November 30, 2001. The fair values of related party loans receivable and payable approximate book value.
The Company incurs and expenses certain costs incurred on behalf of the parents which by their nature are not arms length. The Company charges the parents for these costs and has reflected the reimbursement of such costs, net of tax, in the amount of TEUR 879 and TEUR 382 as contributed capital for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000.
47 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 5. INCOME TAXES The components of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: 2001 TEUR 2000 TEUR Income before income taxes Domestic   (Germany) 11,957 15,670 Foreign 63,139 73,108 Total 75,096 88,778 Income tax provision (benefit) Current Domestic   (Germany) 5,281 9,862 Foreign 24,458 26,131 Total   current 29,739 35,993 Deferred Domestic   (Germany) (333 ) 1,511 Foreign 1,000 83 Total   deferred 667 1,594 Total income tax provision 30,406 37,587 The components of the Company's overall net deferred tax asset at November 30: 2001 TEUR 2000 TEUR Deferred tax assets Tax   loss carry forwards 2,030 1,439 Accrued   expenses 2,441 5,323 Inventory   valuation reserves 1,355 1,973 Accounts   receivable reserves 2,943 1,689 Pension   provision 6,747 5,156 Depreciation   on fixed assets 1,251 569 Other 468 175 Total   deferred tax assets 17,235 16,324 Deferred tax liabilities Amortization   on intangible assets (732 ) (1,040 ) Depreciation   on fixed assets (2,238 ) (2,241 ) Prepaid   Pensions (1,196 ) (930 ) Other (583 ) (382 ) Total   deferred tax liabilities (4,749 ) (4,593 ) Net deferred tax asset 12,486 11,731 48 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 At November 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had net foreign operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes of approximately TEUR 6,868 and TEUR 5,010, respectively. A significant portion of these losses have an indefinite carry forward period; the remaining losses have expiration dates up to five years.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at November 30, 2001 and 2000. During 2000 the valuation allowance decreased by TEUR 694.
A reconciliation of the weighted average European effective tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: 2001 % 2000 % Weighted average European statutory rate 35.6 38.6 Non   deductible items, principally goodwill 4.3 4.3 Provision   for prior years taxes  (1.2 ) Deferred   taxes refundable to parent   Change   in valuation allowance  (0.8 ) Change   in tax rates 0.5  Other 0.1 1.4 Effective income tax rate 40.5 42.3 The deferred taxes refundable to parent reflect the Company Agreement in which the partners also agreed that all tax benefits realized after the formation of the Company should be refunded to the respective parents if the benefits relate to temporary differences that originated in periods prior to the formation of the Company.
Cash paid for taxes for the years ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 was TEUR 27,317 and TEUR 31,822, respectively.

53 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 8. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk factors The Companys activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.The Companys overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company. Henkel-Ecolab uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the operating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investing excess liquidity.
Foreign exchange risk The Company operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the currencies set out in the table below. The Company uses forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury, to hedge their exposure to foreign currency risk in the local reporting currency. Group Treasury is responsible for hedging the net position in each currency by using external forward contracts.
At the group level, external foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions.
Since the Company has subsidiaries not accounting for the results of their operations in Euro, the Euro denominated value of the equity of the Company is also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates.
The accounts of all foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency, except for two countries where, due to hyperinflation, the functional currency has been changed to the Companys reporting currency. With the exception of the hyperinflationary countries, assets and liabilities are translated into the Companys reporting currency, at period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated to the reporting currency at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
Net unrealized exchange gains or losses resulting from such translation are excluded from net earnings and accumulated in a separate component of combined equity. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions during the year and the translation adjustments from hyperinflationary countries are included in the related income statement category. Total gains and (losses) recognized for the year ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 were (2,650) and 469, respectively.
54 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 Notional Amounts and Credit Exposures of Derivatives The notional amounts of derivatives summarized below do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the exposure of the Company through its use of derivatives. The amounts exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional amounts and the other terms of the derivatives, which relate to exchange rates.
Financial instruments contain an element of risk that the counterparties may not be able to meet the terms of the agreement. However, the Company minimises this risk by limiting its counterparties to major banks and financial institutions. Direct credit risk represents the risk of loss from counterparty default in relation to on-balance sheet products. Management does not expect counterparties to default given their high credit ratings.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts in managing its foreign exchange rate risks, as indicated in the following table: November 30, 2001 November 30, 2000 Notional Amount TEUR Credit Exposure TEUR Notional Amount TEUR Credit Exposure TEUR Forward exchange   contracts 71,579  52,177  The purpose of foreign exchange contracts purchased is to hedge various intercompany loans and hedge certain existing and anticipated future net foreign exchange exposures. The anticipated future foreign exchange exposure of the Company is the total of the net balances of all known and planned incoming and outgoing payments of the companies in foreign currencies during a twelve month time horizon.
55 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of the Companys forward exchange contracts in EURO. Foreign currency amounts are translated at rates current at the reporting date. The buy amounts represent the EURO equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the sell amounts represent the EURO equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies : 2001 2000 Buy TEUR Sell TEUR Buy TEUR Sell TEUR Pound   Sterling/US Dollar 31,618 31,618 32,286 32,286 US   Dollar/EURO 11,040 11,040   Swiss   Franc/EURO 8,837 8,837 5,975 5,975 Danish   Krona/EURO 5,776 5,776   Czech   Krona/EURO 5,303 5,303 432 432 Pound   Sterling/EURO 3,206 3,206 8,147 8,147 Swedish   Krona/EURO 2,847 2,847 3,680 3,680 Norwegian   Krona/EURO 1,824 1,824 658 658 Slowakian   Krona/EURO 576 576   Hungarian   Forint/EURO 552 552   Polish   Zloty/EURO   1,000 1,000 71,579 71,579 52,177 52,177 Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk through changes in the interest expense, which arises through interest bearing liabilities. Estimated future changes in cash flows and balance sheet structure also expose the Company to interest rate risk. The individual entities of the combined company are responsible to manage their short term interest rate exposure through a group cash management system. Long term interest rate exposure is monitored and managed by Group Treasury.
Credit risk The Company has no significant concentrations of credit risks. The Company has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions. The Company has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses. Group Treasury aims at maintaining flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
56 Henkel-Ecolab Notes to Combined Financial Statements November 30, 2001 and 2000 Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and subsequently are remeasured at their fair value.
Generally derivative transactions entered into by the Company, while providing effective economic hedges under the Companys risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules in FAS 133. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
In assessing the fair value of non-traded derivatives and other financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The face values less any estimated credit adjustments for financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate their fair values.
