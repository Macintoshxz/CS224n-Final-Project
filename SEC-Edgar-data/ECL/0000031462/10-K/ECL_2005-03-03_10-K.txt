Ecolab undertakes no duty to update its Forward-Looking Statements.
2 Item 1.
Business Item 1(a) General Development of Business Ecolab was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1924. Our fiscal year is the calendar year ending December31.
On November30, 2001, we acquired the 50 percent of the Henkel-Ecolab joint venture (Henkel-Ecolab) which we did not previously own (the JV Acquisition), from our former joint venture partner, Henkel KGaA, Dsseldorf, Germany (Henkel).
Prior to the JV Acquisition, we accounted for our interest in Henkel-Ecolab under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the JV Acquisition, the legal entities constituting Henkel-Ecolab became wholly-owned entities of Ecolab. Following the JV Acquisition, the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Henkel-Ecolab are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a part of the International Cleaning & Sanitizing reportable segment.
During 2003, we continued to make business acquisitions and divestitures to broaden our product and service offerings, or to dispose of non-strategic businesses, in line with our Circle the Customer  Circle the Globe strategy. These transactions included:  Subsequent to the 2002 year-end of our International Operations, we entered the hospital hygiene market in the U.K. by acquiring the Adams Healthcare business of Medical Solutions plc in December2002.
In December2002, we sold Darenas, a U.K. janitorial products distribution business.
In June2003, we sold our investment in Comac S.p.A. of Italy, a floor care machine manufacturing company.
In September2003, we sold a U.K. consumer dermatology business obtained as part of Adams Healthcare.
Additional details regarding the JV Acquisition and these other transactions are found in Notes 5 and 6, located on pages 38 through 40 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 8 hereof.
Effective January2004, we reorganized our businesses serving janitorial and healthcare customers by splitting the Professional Products group into two divisions, Professional Products and Healthcare.
In January2004, we expanded our Pest Elimination business into France by acquiring Nigiko, a Paris-based business that primarily operates through Amboile Services.
In February2004, we acquired Daydots International, a provider of food safety products, for our U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing Operations.
Item 1(b) Financial Information About Operating Segments The financial information about reportable segments appearing under the heading Operating Segments in Note 16, located on page 48 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
3 Item 1(c) Narrative Description of Business General: Ecolab develops and markets premium products and services for the hospitality, foodservice, institutional and industrial markets. We provide cleaning, sanitizing, pest elimination, maintenance and repair products, systems and services primarily to hotels and restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, quick-service (fast-food and other convenience store) units, grocery stores, commercial and institutional laundries, light industry, dairy plants and farms, food and beverage processors, pharmaceutical and cosmetics facilities and the vehicle wash industry. A strong commitment to customer support is a distinguishing characteristic of Ecolab. Additional information on our business philosophy is found below under the heading Additional Information - Competition of this Item 1(c).
The following description of business is based upon our three reportable segments (segments) as reported in Ecolabs consolidated financial statements. However, the Company pursues a Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe strategy by providing products, systems and services which serve our customer base, and does so on a global basis to meet the needs of our customers various operations around the world. Therefore, one customer may utilize the services of all three of the segments and there is a degree of interdependence among the operating segments - particularly between the International Cleaning & Sanitizing and the United States Cleaning & Sanitizing businesses.
United States Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment The United States Cleaning & Sanitizing segment is comprised of seven divisions which provide cleaning and sanitizing services to United States markets.
Institutional : Our Institutional Division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (warewashing), for on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and health care customers) and for general housekeeping functions, as well as dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry. The Institutional Division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for commercial and hospitality customers and, through its Facilitec business, provides rooftop grease filter products and kitchen exhaust cleaning services for restaurants and other foodservice operations. The Institutional Division also manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems, which are made available to customers, to dispense the Companys cleaners and sanitizers. In addition, the Institutional Division markets primarily to smaller and mid-size customer units, a program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance.
We believe we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products to institutions in the United States.
The Institutional Division sells its products and services primarily through Company-employed field sales-and-service personnel. However, to a significant degree, we also utilize independent, third-party foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors. We provide the same service to accounts served by food distributors as to direct customers.
Kay : Our Kay Division (which consists of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ecolab Inc.) supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to the quick-service restaurant industry. This includes traditional fast-food restaurants but also other retail locations where fast food is 4 prepared and served, such as convenience stores, airport and shopping center kiosks and other public venues typically serviced by national or regional restaurant chains. Kay also sells cleaning and sanitizing products to the food retail (i.e., grocery store) industry. Kays products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools. Products are sold under the Kay brand or the customers private label. In addition, Kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers. Kays customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels, cleaning performance, equipment life and safety levels.
Kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quick-service restaurant and food retail chains and franchisees, although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisees units.
We believe that our Kay Division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick-service restaurant industry in the United States. While Kays customer base has been growing, Kays business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quick-service restaurant chains and franchisees.
Food & Beverage : Our Food & Beverage Division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the start of the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption. The Division provides detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products, primarily to dairy plants, dairy farms, breweries, soft-drink bottling plants, and meat, poultry and other food processors as well as to pharmaceutical and cosmetic plants. The Division also markets food irradiation services through an alliance with Ion Beam Applications (IBA). The Food & Beverage Division also designs, engineers and installs CIP (clean-in-place) process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base.
Farm products are sold through dealers and independent, third-party distributors, while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel.
We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy farm, food, meat and poultry, and beverage/brewery processor industries in the United States.
Textile Care : Our Textile Care Division provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems, as well as related services, to large industrial and commercial laundries. Typically these customers process a minimum of 1,000,000 pounds of linen each year and include free-standing laundry plants used by institutions such as hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities as well as industrial and textile rental laundries. The Division also serves the shirt laundry market, typically comprised of smaller laundry units. Products and services include laundry cleaning and specialty products and related dispensing equipment, which are marketed primarily through a Company-employed sales force and, to a lesser extent, through independent, third-party distributors. The Divisions programs are designed to meet our customers need for exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the customers overall operating cost.
Professional Products: The Professional Products Division provides a broad range of janitorial and infection prevention/healthcare offerings to the janitorial and medical markets in the United States. Effective January2004, we reorganized our businesses serving janitorial and healthcare customers by splitting the Professional Products group into two divisions, Professional Products and Healthcare. Professional Products proprietary janitorial products (detergents, general purpose cleaners, carpet care, furniture polishes, disinfectants, floor care products, hand soaps and odor counteractants) are sold primarily under the brand name Airkem. These products are sold 5 primarily through a network of independent, third-party distributors, supported by a Company-employed sales force. Healthcares proprietary infection prevention/healthcare products (skin care, disinfectants and instrument sterilants) are sold primarily under the Huntington brand name.
Vehicle Care: Our Vehicle Care Division provides vehicle appearance products which include soaps, polishes, wheel and tire treatments and air fresheners. Products are sold to vehicle rental, fleet and consumer car wash and detail operations. Brand names utilized by the Vehicle Care Division include Blue Coral  , Black Magic  and Rain-X  .
Water Care Services : Our Water Care Services Division supplements our Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe strategy by offering water treatment programs that are critical to our customer base. Water Care Services provides water and wastewater treatment products, services and systems for commercial/institutional customers (full service hotels, cruise ships, hospitals, healthcare, commercial real estate, government, and commercial laundries), food and beverage customers (dairies, meat, poultry, food processing and beverage) and other light industry. Water Care Services works closely with the our Institutional, Textile Care and Food & Beverage Divisions to offer customized water care strategies to their accounts that have water care needs, primarily to treat water used in heating and cooling systems and manufacturing processes and to treat wastewater.
United States Other Services Segment The United States Other Services segment is comprised of two business units: Pest Elimination and GCS Service. In general, these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business customers as a part of our Circle the Customer approach.
Pest Elimination : Our Pest Elimination Division provides services for the detection, elimination and prevention of pests to restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick-service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers. These services are sold and performed by Company-employed sales and service personnel. In addition, through our EcoSure Food Safety Management business, the Division provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations.
GCS Service : GCS provides commercial kitchen parts and equipment repair services including parts distribution. GCS offers these services to restaurant and other foodservice operations, while providing warranty service for equipment manufacturers. In addition, GCS offers parts at a wholesale level to repair services companies and end users.
International Cleaning & Sanitizing Segment The Company conducts business in approximately 70 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in the case of China, Israel and Venezuela, through majority-owned joint ventures with local partners. In other countries, selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues. Our largest International operations are located in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada, with smaller operations in Africa and the Middle East.
In general, the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the United States, although we customize our products and services to meet unique local requirements. The businesses which are similar to the United States Institutional and Food & Beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our International operations. They are conducted in virtually all our International locations and, compared to the United States, constitute a larger portion of the overall 6 business. Kay also has sales in a number of International locations. A significant portion of Kays International sales are to international units of United States-based quick-service restaurant chains. Consequently, a substantial portion of Kays international sales are made either to domestic or internationally-located third-party distributors who serve these chains.
We expanded our Pest Elimination business to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in September2002, and to France in January2004, through acquisitions. In addition, we entered the hospital hygiene market in the United Kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in December2002. Our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our International locations. However, in general, most of the principal businesses conducted in the United States are operated in Canada and Mexico.
International businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad. The profitability of our International operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the United States. This has been due to the smaller scale of the International operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions.
Additional Information Competition : Our business units have two significant classes of competitors. First, each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-user segments.
Our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets. In general, competition is based on service, product performance and price. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value and differentiated products. Value is provided by state-of-the-art cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction. This is made possible, in part, by our significant on-going investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and comply with safety, environmental and sanitation regulations. In addition, we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services to our customers and to provide that level of service to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide. This approach is succinctly stated in our Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe strategy which is discussed above in this Item 1(c) under the heading General.
Sales and Service : Products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained sales and service personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs. Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets, as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above.
Customers and Classes of Service : We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although, as described above in this Item 1(c) under the description of the Kay business, Kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick-service chains and franchisees. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors (for example, ARAMARK, Compass, Sodexho, Sysco and U.S. Foodservice), the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations 7 for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit. We sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales. Sales of warewashing products in 2003, 2002 and 2001 approximated 23, 23 and 26 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. In addition, through our Institutional and Textile Care businesses, we sell laundry products and services to a broad range of laundry customers. Sales of laundry products and services in 2003, 2002 and 2001 approximated 10, 11 and 10 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Sales of our European operations are reflected in these percentages beginning in 2002.
Patents and Trademarks : We own and license a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, including a license agreement with Henkel KGaA. While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks, and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.
Seasonality : Overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality.
Working Capital : We have invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products. Otherwise, we have no unusual working capital requirements. The investment in merchandising equipment is discussed under the heading Cash Flows located on page 28 of the Annual Report and incorporated into Item 7 hereof.
Manufacturing and Distribution : We manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-owned manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for us by third-party contract manufacturers, including Henkel KGaA. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 14 hereof under the heading Properties.
Deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses. We use common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors. Additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 14 hereof under the heading Properties.
Raw Materials : Raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including phosphates, silicates, alkalies, salts and organic chemicals, including surfactants and solvents. These materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers. When practical, we use global sourcing for production as well as for purchasing raw materials so that our operations can be shifted among locations worldwide to control product costs at globally competitive levels. Pesticides used by our Pest Elimination Division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. Most raw materials, or substitutes for those materials, used by us, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture, are available from several suppliers.
Research and Development : Our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal 8 products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel. At times, technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings. Note 13, entitled Research Expenditures located on page 44 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
Environmental and Regulatory Considerations : Our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with managing hazardous substances, waste disposal or plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we were found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls. Additionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below.
Ingredient Legislation: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity to date.
Pesticide Legislation: Various federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on environmental surfaces and on certain food products. Such products constitute pesticides or antimicrobial pesticides under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain approximately 400 product registrations with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that State. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or the results of our operations to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products have increased in recent years. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations, and for the California tax, were approximately $2,400,000 in 2003 and $2,500,000 in 2002. Congress is evaluating legislation that would increase these fees. Absent such a change, anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
9 In addition, our Pest Elimination Division applies restricted-use pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties. That Division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements.
FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals, processed foods, and medical devices. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations in a Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products dated June17, 1994 that may impose additional requirements and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. To date, such requirements have not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Other Environmental Legislation: Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of toxic substances into the air, land and water. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects were approximately $1,800,000 for 2003 and $1,600,000 for 2002. Approximately $3,600,000 has been budgeted globally for 2004.
Environmental Remediation and Proceedings : Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (PRPs), we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or state equivalents at approximately 20 sites in the United States. Additionally, we have similar liability at eight sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP which actually contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation.
Based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual. In establishing accruals, potential insurance 10 reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.
Our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $500,000 in 2003 and $500,000 in 2002. Including the ChemLawn matters described below, our worldwide accruals at December31, 2003 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately $3,900,000. We review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In connection with the JV Acquisition, we entered into an Environmental Agreement dated December7, 2000 with Henkel under which Henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the former JV. As of December31, 2003, Henkels earlier outstanding reimbursement obligation to us for such environmental liabilities of 108,319 euro (or approximately $116,000) was paid. In addition, we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former ChemLawn business is a PRP. Currently there are five such locations and, at each, ChemLawn is a de minimis party.

Item 2. Properties Our manufacturing philosophy is to manufacture products wherever an economic, process or quality assurance advantage exists or where proprietary manufacturing techniques dictate internal production processes. Currently, most products sold by us are manufactured at our facilities.
Our manufacturing facilities produce chemical products or equipment for all of our businesses, although the businesses constituting the United States Other Services segment purchase the majority of their products and equipment from outside suppliers. Our chemical production process consists primarily of blending and packaging powders and liquids and casting solids. Our equipment manufacturing operations consist primarily of producing chemical product dispensers and ejectors and other mechanical equipment and dishwasher racks and related sundries.
14 The following chart profiles our main manufacturing facilities with ongoing production activities.
In general, manufacturing facilities located in the United States serve the United States Cleaning & Sanitizing segment and facilities located outside of the United States serve the International Cleaning & Sanitizing segment. However, certain of the United States facilities do manufacture products for export and which are used by the International segment. The facilities having export involvement are marked with an asterisk(*).
