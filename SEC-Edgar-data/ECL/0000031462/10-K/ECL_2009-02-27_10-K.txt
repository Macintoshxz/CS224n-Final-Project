Item 1. Business .
Item 1(a)General Development of Business .
Ecolab was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1924. Our fiscal year is the calendar year ending December31.
During 2007, we continued to make business acquisitions to broaden our product offerings and expand our geographic coverage, consistent with our Circle the Customer  Circle the Globe strategy.
In January2007, we established a direct operation in the United Arab Emirates. We previously operated in the country through a distributor, and purchased that business to form the new direct operation in the country. Annual sales are approximately $3 million and became part of our International operations beginning in the first quarter of 2007.
In February2007, we acquired Apprise Technologies,Inc., a Minnesota-based developer of optical sensor technology solutions. Annual sales are approximately $1 million and became part of our U.S. Cleaning& Sanitizing operations beginning in the first quarter of 2007.
In March2007, we acquired Green Harbour, a Hong Kong-based provider of pest elimination services in China and Hong Kong. Annual sales are approximately $4 million and became part of our International operations beginning in the second quarter of 2007.
In May2007, we acquired Fuma Pest, a New Zealand-based provider of pest elimination services. Annual sales are approximately $2 million and became part of our International operations beginning in the second quarter of 2007.
In June2007, we acquired Eagle Environmental Systems, a provider of pest elimination services based in Sydney, Australia. Annual sales are approximately $4 million and became part of our International operations beginning in the third quarter of 2007.
In September2007, we made a minority investment in Site Controls, LLC, a leading provider of energy management and business intelligence solutions.
2 In November2007, we acquired Microtek Medical Holdings,Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of infection control products for healthcare and acute care facilities. Microteks specialized product lines include infection barrier equipment drapes, patient drapes, fluid control products and operating room cleanup systems. Microteks 2006 sales were approximately $150 million and became part of our U.S. Cleaning& Sanitizing and International operations.
Regarding business dispositions, we completed the sale of Peter Cox Limited, a leading United Kingdom provider of damp proofing, waterproofing, timber preservation and wall stabilization for residential, commercial and public properties, in September2007. We acquired Peter Cox Limited in connection with our 2002 purchase of the Terminix Pest Control business in the United Kingdom. 2006 revenues for the Peter Cox business were GBP 16 million (approximately $32 million).
Additional details regarding certain of the above transactions are found in Note 5 located on pages35 and 36 of the Annual Report, and incorporated into Item 8 of this Form10-K.
Item 1(b)Financial Information About Operating Segments .
The financial information about reportable segments appearing under the heading Operating Segments in Note 16, located on pages45 and 46 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1(c)Narrative Description of Business .
General : Ecolab develops and markets premium products and services for the hospitality, foodservice, healthcare and industrial markets. We provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs, as well as pest elimination, maintenance and repair services primarily to hotels and restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, quick-service (fast-food and other convenience store) units, grocery stores, commercial and institutional laundries, light industry, dairy plants and farms, food and beverage processors and the vehicle wash industry. A strong commitment to customer support and sustainable solutions is a distinguishing characteristic of our business. Additional information on our business philosophy is found below under the heading Additional Information  Competition of this Item 1(c).
The following description of our business is based upon our three reportable segments as reported in our consolidated financial statements. However, we pursue a Circle the Customer  Circle the Globe strategy by providing products, systems and services which serve our customer base, and do so on a global basis to meet the needs of our customers various operations around the world. Therefore, one customer may utilize the products or services of all three of the segments and there is interdependence among the operating segments. Revenues of our International segment include sales outside the United States by our Kay and Pest Elimination businesses.
United States Cleaning& Sanitizing Segment The United States Cleaning& Sanitizing segment is comprised of seven business units which provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs to United States markets.
Institutional : Our Institutional Division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (warewashing), for on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and health care customers) and for general housekeeping functions, as well as food safety products and equipment, dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries, and water filters to the foodservice industry. The Institutional Division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers. The Institutional Division manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems, which are made available to customers, to dispense our cleaners and sanitizers. In addition, the Institutional Division markets a lease program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance.
3 We believe we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products and programs to institutions in the United States.
The Institutional Division sells its products and programs primarily through company-employed field sales personnel. However, to a significant degree, we also utilize independent, third-party foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors. We provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by food distributors as to direct customers.
Effective January1, 2007, we integrated our former Professional Products division into the Institutional Division to deliver a broad range of cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality, health care and commercial facilities. The Institutional sales force, along with a network of independent, third-party distributors serving the commercial janitorial industry, market Professional Products proprietary offerings (detergents, general purpose cleaners, carpet care, stone care, furniture polishes, disinfectants, floor care products, hand soaps and odor counteractants).
Kay : Our Kay Division (which consists of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ecolab Inc.) supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to national and regional quick-service restaurant chains. Kays products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools. Products are sold under the Kay brand or the customers private label. In addition, Kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers. Kays customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels, cleaning performance, equipment life and safety levels.
Kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quick-service restaurants and franchisees, although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisees units.
We believe that our Kay Division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick-service restaurant industry in the United States. While Kays customer base has been growing, Kays business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quick-service restaurant chains and franchisees. Kay continues to seek growth and diversification opportunities.
In addition, through Kays Food Retail business, the Division supplies cleaning and sanitizing products to the food retail (i.e., grocery store) industry. Food Retail products are sold primarily through distributors and include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products, assorted cleaning tools and floor care products. We provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by distributors as to direct customers.
Food& Beverage : Our Food& Beverage Division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the beginning of the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption. The Division provides detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products, primarily to dairy plants, dairy farms, breweries, soft-drink bottling plants, and meat, poultry and other food processors. The Food& Beverage Division is also a leading developer and marketer of antimicrobial products used in direct contact with meat, poultry, seafood and produce during processing in order to reduce microbial contamination on those surfaces. The Division also designs, engineers and installs CIP (clean-in-place) process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base. Farm products are sold through dealers and independent, third-party distributors, while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel.
We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy farm, food, meat and poultry, and beverage/brewery processor industries in the United States.
4 Textile Care : Our Textile Care Division provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems, as well as related programs, to large industrial and commercial laundries. Typically these customers process a minimum of 1,000,000 pounds of linen each year and include free-standing laundry plants used by institutions such as hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities as well as industrial and textile rental laundries. Products and programs include laundry cleaning and specialty products, related dispensing equipment, plus water and energy management which are marketed primarily through a Company-employed sales force and, to a lesser extent, through independent, third-party distributors. The Divisions programs are designed to meet our customers need for exceptional cleaning, while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the customers overall operating cost.
Healthcare : Our Healthcare Division provides infection prevention and healthcare offerings to hospital, acute care and long-term care markets in the United States. Healthcares proprietary infection prevention/healthcare products (skin care, disinfectants and instrument cleaners) are sold primarily under the Ecolab, Huntington and Microtek brand names.
Vehicle Care : Our Vehicle Care Division provides vehicle appearance products which include soaps, polishes, sealants, wheel and tire treatments and air fresheners. Products are sold to vehicle rental, fleet and consumer car wash and detail operations. Brand names utilized by the Vehicle Care Division include Blue Coral  , Black Magic  and Rain-X  .
Water Care Services : Water Care Services provides water and wastewater treatment products, services and systems for commercial/institutional customers (full service hotels, cruise ships, hospitals, healthcare, commercial real estate, government, and commercial laundries), food and beverage customers (dairies, meat, poultry, food processing and beverage) and other light industry. Water Care Services works closely with our Institutional, Textile Care and Food& Beverage Divisions to offer customized water care strategies to their accounts that have water care needs, primarily to treat water used in heating and cooling systems and manufacturing processes and to treat wastewater.
United States Other Services Segment The United States Other Services segment is comprised of two business units: Pest Elimination and GCS Service. In general, these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business customers as a part of our Circle the Customer approach.
Pest Elimination : Our Pest Elimination Division provides services for the detection, elimination and prevention of pests to restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick-service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers. These services are sold and performed by Company-employed sales and service personnel. In addition, through our EcoSure Food Safety Management business, we provide customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations.
GCS Service : GCS Service provides commercial cooking and refrigeration equipment repair and maintenance services for restaurant and other foodservice operations. Repair services are offered for in-warranty repair, acting as the Manufacturers Authorized Service Agent, as well as after warranty repair. In addition, GCS Service operates as a parts distributor to repair service companies and end users.
International Segment We conduct business in approximately 70 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in the case of Israel and Venezuela, through joint ventures with local partners. In other countries, selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues. Our largest International operations are located in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America 5 and Canada, with smaller operations in Africa and the Middle East.
In general, the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the United States but are managed on a geographic basis. The businesses which are similar to the United States Institutional and Food& Beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our International operations. They are conducted in virtually all our International locations and, compared to the United States, constitute a larger portion of the overall business. Kay also has sales in a number of International locations. A significant portion of Kays international sales are to international units of United States-based quick-service restaurant chains. Consequently, a substantial portion of Kays international sales are made either to domestic or internationally-located third-party distributors who serve these chains.
Our Pest Elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage. Since 2001, we have entered markets in Asia, Western Europe and Latin America, with the largest operations in France and the United Kingdom.
Our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our International locations. However, in general, most of the principal businesses conducted in the United States are operated in Canada.
International businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad. The profitability of our International operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the United States. This has been due to the smaller scale of the International operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions.
Additional Information Competition : Our business units have two significant classes of competitors. First, each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-user segments.
Our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets. In general, competition is based on customer support, product performance and price. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customer protect its brand reputation. Value is provided by state-of-the-art cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction. This is made possible, in part, by our significant on-going investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety, environmental and sanitation regulations. In addition, we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide. This approach is succinctly stated in our Circle the Customer - Circle the Globe strategy which is discussed above in this Item 1(c)under the heading General.
Sales : Products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs. Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets, as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above.
Number of Employees : We have approximately 26,050 employees.
6 Customers and Classes of Products : We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although, as described above in this Item 1(c)under the description of the Kay business, Kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick-service chains and franchisees. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit. We sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales. Sales of warewashing products in 2007, 2006 and 2005 approximated 22, 21 and 21 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. In addition, through our Institutional and Textile Care businesses, we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of laundry customers. Sales of laundry products and services in 2007, 2006 and 2005 approximated 10, 10 and 11 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
Patents and Trademarks : We own and license a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through a license agreement with Henkel KGaA. While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks, and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.
Seasonality : Overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality. However, we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments. Note 17, entitled Quarterly Financial Data located on page47 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
Working Capital : We have invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products. Otherwise, we have no unusual working capital requirements.
Manufacturing and Distribution : We manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-owned manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for us by third-party contract manufacturers, including Henkel KGaA. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page16 of this Form10-K under the heading Properties.
Deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses. We use common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors. Additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page16 of this Form10-K under the heading Properties.
Raw Materials : Raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including alkalis, acids, phosphates, silicates and salts, and organic chemicals, including surfactants and solvents. These materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers. When practical, global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels. Pesticides used by our Pest Elimination Division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. Most raw materials, or substitutes for those materials, used by us, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture, are available from several suppliers.
7 Research and Development : Our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel. At times, technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings. Note 13, entitled Research Expenditures located on page41 of the Annual Report, is incorporated herein by reference.
Environmental and Regulatory Considerations : Our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances, waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Additionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below.
Ingredient Legislation : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. Green chemistry initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states, including California, Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to date.
Pesticide Legislation : Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products. Such products constitute pesticides or antimicrobial pesticides under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain approximately 350 product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that State. While the cost of complying with rulesas to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations, and for the California tax, were approximately $2,800,000 in 2007 and $3,400,000 in 2006. In Europe, the Biocidal Product Directive (98/8/EC) (BPD) established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products. We are working with suppliers and industry 8 groups to manage requirements associated with the BPD, and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances. Anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In addition, our Pest Elimination Division applies restricted-use pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties. That Division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements.
FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals, foods and medical devices. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations in a Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products dated June17, 1994, which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Europe : The European Union is developing a new regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH). The European Parliament and Council adopted the REACH regulation in December2006, which became effective in June2007. It established a new European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe. All new and existing chemicals produced or imported into the European Union in quantities above one ton per year must be registered in a central database. For chemicals deemed to be of most concern, industry must gain specific authorization for particular uses which have been demonstrated to be safe. Other uses would be prohibited. To manage this new program, we are simplifying our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements. The eventual impact of REACH will also be felt by our competitors. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable, but are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In 2003, the United Nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). GHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide, uniform system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized safety labeling and safety warnings. Individual countries and regional organizations either have begun to implement GHS or are considering what portions of it will be adopted and within what timeframe. Most countries in which we operate will adopt GHS-related legislation. The primary cost of compliance will revolve around labeling, and we are working toward a phased-in approach to mitigate risks of GHS implementation. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
9 Other Environmental Legislation : Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air, land and water. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $8,100,000 in 2007 and $6,400,000 in 2006. Approximately $7,800,000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2008.
Climate Change : Various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels, particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. None of these laws and regulations directly applies to Ecolab at the present time, however, as a matter of corporate policy, Ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness. Ecolab has joined U.S. EPAs Climate Leaders program, and as part of that program we have pledged to develop a corporate-wide U.S. GHG emission inventory and work with EPA to set a GHG reduction goal in 2008.
Environmental Remediation and Proceedings : Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (PRPs), we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or state equivalents at 19 sites in the United States. Additionally, we have similar liability at nine sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP that actually contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Pursuant to an Environmental Agreement dated December7, 2000 with Henkel KGaA, Henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the parties former joint venture in Europe. We received euro 626,763 (approximately $917,000) from Henkel in 2007 for such environmental liabilities and we recently requested an additional euro 203,890 (approximately $300,000 at December31, 2007) for new environmental costs.
Based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.
10 Our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $1,060,000 in 2007 and $950,000 in 2006. Including the ChemLawn matters described below, our worldwide accruals at December31, 2007 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately $3,990,000. We review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former ChemLawn business is a PRP. Currently there are five such locations and, at each, ChemLawn is a de minimis party. Anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued ChemLawn operations in 1991. The accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors .
The following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Form10-K. See the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements located on page2 of this Form10-K.
We may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forward-looking statements made in oral presentations, including telephone conference and/or webcasts open to the public.
Except as may be required under applicable law, we undertake no duty to update our Forward-Looking Statements.
Our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve: Economic downturns, and in particular downturns in the foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care and food processing industries, can adversely impact our end-users who are sensitive to changes in travel and dining activities. During such downturns, these end-users typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning, hygiene and appearance products, which would likely in turn have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cas h flows.
Our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value, product offerings and customer support: Our competitive market is made up of numerous national, regional and local competitors. Our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize innovative, high value-added products for niche applications. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future. In addition, certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets. If we fail to timely introduce new technologies, we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be adversely affected.
We enter into multi-year contracts with customers that can impact our results: We enter into multi-year contracts with some of our customers which include terms affecting our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and operating income.
Consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results: Customers and vendors in the foodservice, hospitality and lodging industry have been consolidating in recent years and that trend may continue. This consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and operating income.
14 Our results can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials: The prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate significantly from time to time, and have increased in recent years. Changes in oil or raw material prices, unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect ou r consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
If we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions, our business could be adversely affected : As part of our long-term strategy, we seek to acquire complementary businesses. There can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses. If the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.
If we are unsuccessful in executing on business investments, our business could be adversely affected: We are making investments to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns. If the projects in which we are investing are not successfully executed, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our business depends on our ability to comply with governmental regulations: Our business is subject to numerous regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products. Compliance with these regulations, as well as changes in tax, fiscal, governmental and other regulatory policies expose us to potential financial liability and increase our operating costs. Regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards, causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs. The potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations, and the timing and expense of compliance. In addition, changes in accounting standards, including the adoption effective January1, 2007 of FASB Interpretation No.48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, could increase the volatility of our quarterly tax rate.
Our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors: Economic factors such as the worldwide economy, interest rates and currency movements including, in particular, our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows in the future.
Extraordinary events may significantly impact our business: The occurrence of (a)litigation or claims, (b)the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c)war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets), (d)natural or manmade disasters, or (e)severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries may have a significant, adverse impact on our business.
Defense of litigation, particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust, patent infringement, wage hour and class action lawsuits, can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful, and if not successful could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
15 While we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position.
War (including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or manmade disasters or severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries cause a d ownturn in the business of restaurants, motels and hotels and other of our customers, which in turn can have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We depend on key personnel to lead our business: O ur continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees. Our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments .
We have no unresolved comments from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 2. Properties .
Our manufacturing philosophy is to manufacture products wherever an economic, process or quality assurance advantage exists or where proprietary manufacturing techniques dictate internal production processes. Currently, most products sold by us are manufactured at our facilities.
Our manufacturing facilities produce chemical products or equipment for all of our businesses, although the businesses constituting the United States Other Services segment purchase the majority of their products and equipment from outside suppliers. Our chemical production process consists primarily of blending and packaging powders and liquids and casting solids. Our equipment manufacturing operations consist primarily of producing chemical product dispensers and injectors and other mechanical equipment and dishwasher racks and related sundries.
The following chart profiles our main manufacturing facilities with ongoing production activities. In general, manufacturing facilities located in the United States serve the United States Cleaning& Sanitizing segment and facilities located outside of the United States serve the International segment. However, certain of the United States facilities do manufacture products for export and which are used by the International segment. The facilities having export involvement are marked with an asterisk (*).

A new manufacturing facility in Wales, U.K. is nearing completion.
Most of our manufacturing plants also serve as distribution centers. In addition, we operate distribution centers around the world, all of which are leased, and utilize various public warehouses to facilitate the distribution of our products and services. In the United States, our sales and service associates are located in approximately 90 leased offices. Additional sales offices are located internationally.
Our corporate headquarters is comprised of three adjacent multi-storied buildings located in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. The main 19-story building was constructed to our specifications and is leased through 2013. Thereafter, it is subject to multiple renewals at our option. The second building is leased through 2011 with additional options available. The third building is owned. The corporate headquarters includes an employee training center. In April 2004, we purchased a 90 acre campus in Eagan, Minnesota to provide for future growth. The acquired facility houses the research and development and data center requirements as well as several of our administrative functions. Renovations of the buildings on this property, comprising approximately 500,000 square feet, have been completed and more than 900 associates now work at this site.

20 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures .
Disclosure Controls and Procedures : As of December31, 2007, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule13a-15(e)under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended). Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting : Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under this framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007.
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. Their report, and our management reports, can be found in our Annual Report, the relevant portion of which has been filed as Exhibit(13) to this Form10-K and is incorporated into Item 8 of this Form10-K.
During the period October1 - December31, 2007, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information .
The following disclosures would otherwise be filed on Form8-K under the heading Item 5.02(e) Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
In the paragraphs below describing certain of our executive compensation plans and programs, the Named Executive Officers or NEOs refer to our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer during 2007 and the next three most-highly compensated executive officers who were serving in those capacities at December31, 2007, and the Committee refers to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
General : The components of the overall compensation program for the Companys executive officers include base salary, long-term incentives in the form of annual stock option awards, cash-based annual bonus incentives, participation in deferred compensation and retirement plans, and certain perquisites. Information regarding the compensation awarded to the NEOs in respect of and during the year ended December31, 2007 will be provided in the definitive proxy statement for the Companys 2008 annual meeting of stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or around March19, 2008.
Base Salary : For the 2008 fiscal year, base salaries for the NEOs, other than the CEO, are scheduled to increase on an annualized basis by an average of 6.2%. The salary of the CEO has been established at $1,000,000, representing an increase of $100,000 over 2007. The base salaries established for the 2008 fiscal year for the NEOs are included as a part of the Named Executive Officer Summary of Base Salary, Bonus Award Opportunities, and Executive Benefits and Perquisites filed as Exhibit(10)S to this Form10-K and incorporated by reference herein.
21 Establishment of 2008 Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation Criteria : The Company maintains annual cash incentive programs for executives referred to as the Management Incentive Plan or MIP and Management Performance Incentive Plan or MPIP. The Companys stockholders approved the current version of the MPIP in 2004, an annual incentive plan under which awards should qualify as performance based under Internal Revenue Code Section162(m). On February20, 2008, as required under the terms of the MPIP, the Committee selected the CEO and CFO and the three other NEOs to participate in the MPIP for 2008, established the 2008 performance goal based upon the performance criteria of diluted earnings per share (EPS), set an EPS performance target of a designated earnings per share, and a designated cash award of 300% of the base salary of each such officer for 2008 to the extent the goal is achieved. The award is subject to and interpreted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the MPIP and no amount will be paid under the MPIP unless and until the Committee has determined the extent to which the performance goal has been met and the corresponding amount of the award earned by the participant. The MPIP permits the Committee to exercise downward discretion so as to pay an amount which is less than the amount of the award earned by the participant. In applying this downward discretion, the Committee considers underlying operable metrics communicated to the participant, which are described as a part of the Named Executive Officer Summary of Base Salary, Bonus Award Opportunities, and Executive Benefits and Perquisites filed as Exhibit(10)S to this Form10-K and incorporated by reference herein. One other NEO will participate in the MIP in 2008 and the operating metrics with respect to such NEOs participation are similarly included as a part of Exhibit(10)S.
The following disclosures would otherwise be filed on Form8-K under the heading Item 5.03 - Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On February22, 2008, Ecolabs Board of Directors approved the following amendments to the Companys By-Laws: (1)ArticleIV, Section1 was amended to reflect that the Board may elect one or more Sector Presidents; (2)ArticleVII, Section1 was amended to include the position of Sector Presidents and General Counsel among the officers entitled to sign contracts and other instruments; and (3)ArticleVI, Section1 and Section2 were amended to allow stock to be issued in book-entry form without a physical stock certificate.
