PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999 and we introduced our service offering in February 2000. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California and our website address is www.salesforce.com . Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105.
We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to an August 2005 report by International Data Corporation, or IDC. We provide a comprehensive customer relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide.
We designed and developed our hosted service to be a low-cost, easy-to-use application that is easy and quick to deploy, customizable and can be integrated with other software applications. We deliver our service through a standard Web browser. Customers who use our on-demand CRM service are able to avoid many of the expenses and complexities of traditional enterprise software implementations. As a result, our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs. Our service helps customers more effectively manage and share their sales, support, marketing and partner information on-demand. We market our service to businesses on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. As of January31, 2006, our customer base had grown to approximately 20,500 worldwide, and we had approximately 399,000 paying subscriptions. We define paying subscriptions as unique user accounts, purchased by customers for use by their employees and other customer-authorized users, that have not been suspended for non-payment and for which we are recognizing subscription revenue.
1 Table of Contents Industry Background The Enterprise Application Software Market Over the last thirty years, there have been several shifts in the way vendors deliver enterprise software applications. In the 1970s and 1980s, vendors delivered application software through centralized mainframe based systems. This evolved in the 1990s to client/server computing.
Many businesses purchased, built and deployed a wide range of enterprise software applications in such areas as enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and CRM. Businesses had no choice but to install, configure, manage and maintain the hardware, software and network services needed to implement the software application in-house. As a result, enterprise software applications were historically available mostly to large businesses with the financial resources to make such investments.
While technology improvements brought increased processing power and application functionality intended to enable businesses to automate and improve their basic processes, businesses have been challenged to realize the benefits of these applications for a variety of reasons, including the following:  Difficulty of deployment . The increasing number and complexity of applications, operating systems, networks and computer systems have made it difficult and time consuming for businesses to implement and use enterprise software applications.
High cost of ownership . Enterprise software applications carry a high total cost of ownership. Customers must make significant investments, both initially and on an ongoing basis, in applications and IT infrastructure, including computer systems, networks, software licenses, service and support and maintenance. Additionally, customers typically must employ costly IT staff and consultants to deploy, integrate, customize, support, administer and upgrade these applications.
In an attempt to address these challenges, many enterprise software application vendors adapted their products to be accessible over the Internet. However, as these products were not originally designed to be delivered over the Internet as a service, they failed to address these challenges. In addition, because they are not easy to use, users were hesitant to adopt these complex, non-intuitive installed applications.
Emergence of On-Demand Application Services The pervasiveness of the Internet, along with the dramatic declines in the pricing of computing technology and network bandwidth, have enabled a new generation of enterprise computing in which substantial components of IT infrastructure can be provisioned and delivered dynamically over the Internet on an outsourced basis. This new computing paradigm is sometimes referred to as utility computing, while the outsourced software applications are referred to as on-demand application services.
On-demand application services enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for, and delivered over, the Internet on an as-needed basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage third-party software in-house.
We feel that the key attributes of successful on-demand application services include:  the availability of enterprise application services to customers of all sizes and across all industries;  a fully outsourced service accessible over the Internet and through a variety of devices, including laptop computers and PDAs;  rapid and simple deployment, configuration and training;  a comprehensive set of application features;  a scalable, secure and reliable application architecture that can economically support hundreds of thousands of customers simultaneously; 2 Table of Contents  the ability to integrate with businesses existing third-party and internally developed enterprise applications and databases; and  the ability to tailor the appearance, policy settings, workflow and other characteristics of the service to meet the needs of a diverse customer base.
On-demand application services contrast with the traditional enterprise software model, which requires each customer to install, configure, manage and maintain the hardware, software and network services to implement the software application in-house. Moreover, traditional enterprise software vendors must maintain support for numerous legacy versions of their software and compatibility with a wide array of hardware devices and operating environments, and as a result dedicate fewer resources to innovation and incur higher research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue than on-demand application service providers.
On-demand application services also contrast with solutions offered by first-generation application service providers, commonly referred to as ASPs, which host third-party enterprise applications on behalf of their customers. Since these ASPs are deploying traditional third-party enterprise software applications with each customer typically running on a separate instance, or copy, of the software, ASPs remain challenged by the time and expense problems associated with purchasing, implementing, integrating, maintaining and supporting these applications. Additionally, because ASP hosting typically involves the installation of one dedicated server or set of servers to support a small number of customers, ASPs are challenged to cost-effectively scale to support a larger customer base.
We believe the shift to on-demand application services provides significant benefits. Businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors, such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications, while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs of owning enterprise software. As a result, we believe the emergence of on-demand application services will continue to bring about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses will be able to replace their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services. According to an April 2005 report by IDC, 79% of companies surveyed are now purchasing or reviewing on-demand application offerings.
The Opportunity for On-Demand CRM Application Services One category of enterprise software applications in which businesses have made significant investments is CRM. CRM software is intended to enable businesses to automate three key functional areas: sales, customer service and support, and marketing. The objective of CRM is to improve interactions with customers by providing a means for recording, managing, accessing and analyzing information regarding all aspects of a companys interactions with its customers.
The difficulties that companies have faced in deploying and maintaining enterprise software applications in general are particularly relevant to CRM. Despite the significant potential benefits that can be attained from CRM, many enterprises have failed to successfully deploy the CRM software they have purchased.
We believe that traditional CRM applications have generally suffered from the following challenges:  Low deployment rates and low user adoption . Customers have been reluctant to deploy traditional CRM applications as well as add-on applications developed by third-party developers because of the complexity involved in implementing, customizing and integrating them and because end users have not been willing to invest the considerable time and effort required to learn to use these applications.
Lack of ubiquitous access . Given the mobility and geographic diversity of most enterprise sales organizations, ubiquitous access to customer information and application functionality is critical to the effectiveness of CRM applications. As enterprise CRM software application functionality has not been 3 Table of Contents available or has been difficult to access over the Internet and through laptops and PDAs, full realization of the benefits of sharing access to information and resources has been hindered.
Low return on investment . The cost, time and effort required to implement an enterprise CRM application, combined with low user adoption, have made it difficult for companies to quickly, or ever, realize the benefits of their investment.
Inability to serve businesses of all sizes . Many small and medium-sized businesses seeking the benefits of CRM have been unable to afford the costs associated with traditional enterprise software CRM applications.
We believe that the CRM market is one of the first markets to benefit from the new on-demand application services delivery model. As a result of the high total cost of ownership, low deployment and usage rates, and poor return on investment of traditional CRM software, we believe that businesses are especially open to a new delivery model for CRM. The emergence of on-demand application services, combined with the deficiencies associated with traditional CRM software applications, have created an opportunity for a vendor that can provide on-demand CRM application services that have been specifically designed and built to be delivered over the Internet.
Our Solution We are the leading provider of on-demand CRM, helping companies better track, manage and share information regarding their sales, customer service and support, and marketing operations. As of January31, 2006, our customer base had grown to approximately 20,500 worldwide, and we had approximately 399,000 paying subscriptions. We provide our service to businesses through our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant application architecture, which allows us to serve large numbers of customers cost-effectively by leveraging a single application code base.
By subscribing to our service, our customers do not have to make large and risky upfront investments in software, additional hardware, extensive implementation services, and additional IT staff. As a result, our service enables businesses to achieve higher productivity from, and a lower total cost of ownership for, their CRM solutions.
Key advantages of our solution include:  Rapid deployment.
Our service can be deployed rapidly and provisioned easily, since our customers do not have to spend time installing or maintaining the servers, networking equipment, security products or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary to ensure a scalable and reliable service. We believe the average time that a customer requires to deploy our service is significantly shorter than typical, traditional CRM software deployments. We also offer complementary consulting and training services to assist customers in rapidly deploying and optimizing their use of our service.
Enable high levels of user adoption.
We have designed our service to be easy-to-use and intuitive. Since our service contains many tools and features recognizable to users of popular websites such as those of Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo!, it has a more familiar interface than typical CRM enterprise applications. As a result, our users do not require substantial training on how to use and benefit from our service. We conduct extensive surveys of our users to gauge their experiences with our service so that we may determine potential areas of improvement. In addition, because of the nature of our service, we receive automatic feedback as to which features customers use.
Lower total cost of ownership.
We enable customers to achieve significant savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers also benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they pay for the service, which includes upgrades, on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract.
4 Table of Contents Additionally, our service enables customers to automate sales, customer service and support and marketing processes without having to make large and risky upfront investments in software, hardware, implementation services and additional IT staff. Also, because all upgrades are implemented by us on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. Customers are not burdened or disrupted by the need to upgrade systems.
Extensive features, functionality and configurability.
We offer a comprehensive array of CRM features that meet the needs of businesses of any size. Our service supports the three key functional areas within CRMsales, customer service and support, and marketing automation. Most of the features of our service can be accessed through a variety of devices, including laptop computers and PDAs. For example, we offer an offline version of our service that can be used on any PC or laptop. Additionally, through our introduction of the AppExchange Builder (previously called Customforce), our service is highly configurable in a short amount of time, enabling our customers to tailor its appearance, policy settings, language, workflow, reports and other characteristics without the use of significant IT resources or consultants.
Secure, scalable and reliable delivery platform.
The delivery platform for our service has been designed to provide our customers with high levels of reliability, performance and security. We have built and continue to invest in a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. In addition, all of our customers data is replicated in near real-time to help protect the data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost-effectively to tens of thousands of customers and millions of users. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Our architecture also enables customers to segment access privileges across their user base.
Ease of integration.
Our platform is designed to enable IT professionals to integrate our service with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. Our AppExchange platform provides a set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, that enable customers and independent developers to integrate our service with existing third-party, custom and legacy applications and write their own application services that integrate with our service. For example, many of our customers use the AppExhange APIs to move customer-related data from custom-developed and legacy applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities.
Our Strategy Our objective is to be the leading provider of on-demand application services for businesses worldwide. We want to manage more than CRM data. However, we believe that CRM still presents a significant growth opportunity. Key elements of our strategy include:  Continue to lead the industry transformation to on-demand application services.
We believe that the market transformation to on-demand application services enabled by utility computing is a growing trend in the technology industry. We enable customers of all sizes to be able to benefit from the capabilities of enterprise software applications. We believe we have established a leadership position in this new industry both as a successful vendor of on-demand application services and also as a key thought leader helping to define the architecture and vision of utility computing. We seek to extend our leadership position in this industry by continuing to innovate and bring new on-demand application services and value-added technologies to market.
Strengthen and extend our service offering.
We designed our service to easily accommodate new features and functions as well as the release of entirely new application services. We intend to continue to add CRM features and functionality to our core service that we will make available to customers at no 5 Table of Contents additional charge. We offer advanced modules for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced CRM capabilities. We also evaluate acquisition or investment opportunities in complementary companies, services and technologies in an effort to strengthen and extend our service offering. In addition to accommodating new CRM features, we believe that our technology infrastructure is able to support entirely different, non-CRM application capabilities.
Pursue new customers and new territories aggressively.
We believe that our on-demand CRM application service provides significant value for businesses of any size, from small businesses to the largest Fortune 500 corporations. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. We have created several editions of our service to address the distinct requirements of businesses of different sizes. We also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service outside of North America. We plan to continue to aggressively market to customers outside of North America by recruiting local sales and support professionals, building partnerships that help us add customers in these regions and increasing the number of languages we support. As of January31, 2006, we offer our service in 12 languages.
Deepen relationships with our existing customer base.
We believe there is significant opportunity to leverage our relationships with existing customers. We want to sell more subscriptions to existing customers by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization and pursuing enterprise-wide deployments, and we want to provide professional service offerings that are complementary to our service and enable us to sell subscriptions to larger customers who require assistance with complex integrations and customizations.
In addition, by continuously enhancing the functionality of our service, we believe that customers will find more uses for our service and therefore purchase additional subscriptions, continue to renew their existing subscriptions and upgrade to more fully featured versions such as our Enterprise Edition.
Encourage the development of third-party applications on our AppExchange API platform.
Our AppExchange API (previously called sforce) platform enables existing customers and third-party developers to develop and deliver applications complementary to our core service offering. It is a platform where applications can be built and traded. We believe the ecosystem of developers will address the business requirements of both current and potential subscribers. The AppExchange API platform enhances the attractiveness of our service, particularly to enterprise customers, by enabling them to accelerate the integration of our service with their existing applications. With the introduction of the AppExchange Builder, we are able to continue to augment the tools and services we provide to developers and foster their development of new applications.
In continuing with our efforts to encourage the development of third-party applications that will benefit our customers, in September 2005 we introduced the AppExchange directory, an online marketplace that we host for our customers, developers and partners to exchange custom applications that are built on and can integrate with our service.
The salesforce.com Service We provide a comprehensive array of on-demand CRM and business application services, which enable customers and subscribers to systematically record, store, and act upon business data and to help businesses manage customer accounts, track sales leads, evaluate marketing campaigns, and provide post-sales service. We also enable companies to generate reports and summaries of this data and share them with authorized individuals across functional areas. Our CRM services mainly focus on the following areas:  Sales Force Automation , which is marketed under our brand Salesforce SFA, enables salespeople to be more productive by automating manual and repetitive tasks and by providing them with better, more organized data about current and prospective customers. Salesforce SFA helps companies establish a 6 Table of Contents system and process for recording, tracking, and sharing information about sales opportunities, sales leads, sales forecasts, the sales process, closed business, and managing sales territories.
Marketing Automation , which is marketed under our brand Salesforce Marketing, enables companies to manage marketing campaigns from initiation through the development of leads that are passed to the sales team and enables them to determine the effectiveness of each campaign by quantifying the revenue generated as a result of specific marketing activities.
Customer Service and Support Automation , which is marketed under our brand Salesforce Service& Support (previously called Supportforce), allows companies to interact better and more efficiently and professionally with their existing customers for a variety of needs, such as requests for repairs, advice about products and services, complaints about faulty goods, and the need for additional goods and services. Using Salesforce Service& Support, customers can create a comprehensive, fully-integrated virtual contact center to support a wide range of customer interactions that occur through voice, chat, email, and in-person interactions.
In September 2005, we introduced the AppExchange directory, which is an on-demand application-sharing service and an on-demand platform that customers can leverage to build and deploy their own custom applications to extend Salesforce beyond CRM services. AppExchange provides a way to browse, test-drive, share, and install applications developed on our on-demand AppExchange platform. Partners, developers, and anyone else who chooses to participate can offer their applications on the AppExchange directory. This directory gives our users an easy way to find and install applications to expand their use of the AppExchange platform to new areas of customer relationship management. We currently do not charge users or partners a fee or royalty for applications in the directory.
As of January31, 2006, we offered three principal editions of our service for a fee: Team Edition, Professional Edition, and Enterprise Edition. We derived approximately 90 percent or more of our revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 from subscriptions to and support for our service.
Team Edition.
Team Edition, which is limited to five subscribers, is targeted primarily at small businesses and workgroups that seek a basic sales force automation and case management solution without the sophisticated features that are required by larger companies. Users can use Team Edition to share important customer data and manage their customer relationsfrom the start of the sales cycle to closing the deal to providing customer support and service. Team Edition offers access to accounts, contacts, opportunities, cases and reports. It does not include the more advanced customer service and support or marketing automation features such as: campaigns, forecasts, leads, solutions, online case capture, self-service portal, notes and attachments, Offline Edition and mass email capabilities. Using the AppExchange platform, customers can further extend and customize Team Edition by adding additional custom tabs and/or a custom application.
Professional Edition.
Professional Edition is targeted primarily at medium-sized and large businesses that need a robust and complete CRM solution, but do not need some of the more advanced administrative features and integration capabilities. Professional Edition offers companies a comprehensive CRM suite that business users can use to manage every aspect of the customer lifecycle. In addition to everything available in Team Edition, it provides users more advanced CRM functionality such as: campaigns, forecasts, lead management, contract management, solutions, online case capture and a self-service portal. Professional Edition also comes with standard, easy-to-use customization, security and sharing, integration and administration tools to facilitate any small- to mid-sized deployment. Using the AppExhange platform, Professional Edition customers have more flexibility than Team Edition customers to further extend and customize their service by adding more custom applications, custom tabs and/or custom objects.
Enterprise Edition.
Enterprise Edition is our most fully featured CRM service offering and is designed to meet the complex business needs of large organizations with many divisions or departments. In addition to all of the functionality available in Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition offers customers: 7 Table of Contents A) our most advanced CRM functionality, such as territory management that uses a rule-based territory assignment engine to categorize accounts and users into territories, products& schedules that tracks revenue and quantity by opportunities; B) sophisticated Multi-Divisional Sharing and Permissions such as profile-based departmental security and sharing; C) Workflow and Business Process Control such as workflow automation tasks; D) Enterprise Customization and Integration tools that can support large-scale deployments, such AppExchange and web service APIs for back-office integration that enables companies to readily integrate Salesforce with ERP applications and other data sources.
With Enterprise Edition, customers also have the maximum flexibility and control to fully extend and customize their Salesforce.com application by adding more custom applications, custom tabs and/or custom objects.
Each of the editions described above entitles customers to our standard customer support services, which are available 12 hours a day, five days a week, with a 48-hour response time guarantee. For advanced customers with more complex business needs, we provide additional levels of fee-based customer support.
In addition to the three editions, we continue to innovate and develop additional products and services as optional add-on subscriptions to better meet different customers individual needs. Some examples include:  Offline Edition: Offline Edition allows customers to view and modify their CRM data, such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, tasks, and events while disconnected from the Internet. Offline Edition is included in all Enterprise Edition service subscriptions. Customers of Professional Edition can choose to subscribe as an add-on service.
Products & Schedules: Products & Schedules allows customers to define products, associate it with a price in a price book and establish schedules for products on all sales opportunities. It provides customers the critical information to track and forecast revenue by products. Products & Schedules is included in all Enterprise Edition service subscriptions. Customers of Professional Edition can choose to subscribe as an add-on service.
Salesforce Sandbox: Salesforce Sandbox enables customers to test new customizations or features before deploying them. Customers can use Sandbox to install, modify, and test applications downloaded from the AppExchange or to create a development environment for building and testing integrations and internally built applications. Additionally, customers may use Salesforce Sandbox as an exact replica of their production salesforce system for employee training purposes.
As part of our marketing programs, we also offer a Personal Edition service which includes a contact management database and several other features that are useful to individual sales representatives and others who need a centralized way to organize contact data and access that data over the Internet. It is intended for use by a single user and is currently available at no charge. In addition, we offer a service called Developer Edition, currently at no charge, to developers and others interested in building applications on our AppExchange platform.
Our customers can customize and integrate our application with other software applications in a variety of ways. For example, through our AppExchange API, a customer can integrate our service with multiple ERP systems including Oracle financial software and Siebel customer support software, and an ISV can integrate a customers sales force automation and content management data with the professional services management system the ISV built. Additionally, through our AppExchange Builder, a customer can tailor the features of the service to meet their business requirements or create new on-demand applications through a point-and-click interface and without the use of significant IT resources or consultants.
In June 2005, we launched AppExchange OS (previously called Multiforce), which is an extension of the capabilities of AppExchange Builder. Through AppExchange OS, our subscribers can multi-task between 8 Table of Contents multiple on-demand applications, all running in the same service environment, with a single click. AppExchange OS extends the range of custom applications beyond CRM.
We currently do not charge users a fee or royalty on the AppExchange directory, AppExchange OS, AppExchange Builder, AppExchange API or applications developed with the AppExchange platform.
Professional Services We offer consulting and implementation services and training that complement our on-demand application service.
Consulting and Implementation Services We offer consulting and implementation services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our on-demand CRM application service. Consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping, project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service. Implementation services include systems integration, configuration and data conversion. The majority of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis. For many of our small and medium-sized business customers, we also offer for a fixed price certain implementation services that take up to a week to complete.
Training We offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as implementing, using and administering our service. We also offer classes for our partners who implement our service on behalf of our customers.
We bill the traditional classroom and some of the on-line educational classes on a per person, per class basis. The majority of our on-line educational classes are available at no charge to customers who subscribe to our service. We also assist customers in developing and delivering a customized education program for their employees. The majority of these custom training engagements are billed on a time and materials basis.
Technology, Development and Operations Technology We believe that our on-demand application service enables us to develop functionality and deliver it to customers more efficiently than traditional enterprise software vendors. We do not provide software that must be written to different hardware, operating system and database platforms, or that depends upon a customers unique systems environment. Rather, we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers. Performance, functional depth and usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction.
We built our service as a highly scalable, multi-tenant application written in Java and Oracle PL/SQL. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software, including database software from Oracle Corporation, to provide our service. The application server is custom-built and runs on a lightweight Java Servlet and Java Server Pages engine. We have custom-built core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment, allowing us to continue to scale our service. We have combined a stateless environment, in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers, with an advanced data caching layer. Our customers can access the service through any Web browser without installing any software or downloading Java applets or Microsoft ActiveX or .NET controls.
9 Table of Contents Our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors, even those that have modified their products to be accessible over the Internet. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications.
Our service is also flexible. Every page is dynamically rendered for each specific user, including a choice of 12 languages and a number of currencies with dynamic currency conversion support. In addition, our service can display different views of the data based upon a number of factors, including user, department and area of responsibility in the company. Our service also allows customers to create multiple subtypes or subclasses of our business objects and tie views to each record type. This customization extends to the data model of our service, as our service allows customers to extend existing tables in our database as well as create new tables without actually modifying the underlying physical database schema.
We have also developed extensive reporting and analytics functionality in our service that operates on the online transaction processing, or OLTP, database system to provide real-time analysis of the users data. While users can customize any report or dashboard in the service, we dynamically tune the database based upon specific attributes of the user, the data model, the data security layer and the specific customizations to each report or dashboard.
We have built a service-oriented architecture, or SOA, which allows our service to be addressable by other applications on the Internet and by applications behind customers firewalls. Through our AppExchange API platform, we allow customers and partners to insert, update, delete and query any of their information in our service. Our full-text search engine, which allows users to perform natural language queries on all the data through a browser, is also exposed as a Web service. In addition, we have mechanisms to protect our service not only from malicious abuse, but from poorly written applications that put undue strain on the service. Each user session is encrypted, and we actively monitor our system to detect intrusion by unauthorized users.
Development Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services. In addition, from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources. Because of our common, multi-tenant application architecture, we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application and are able to maintain relatively low research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses were $23.3 million in fiscal 2006, $9.8 million in fiscal 2005 and $7.0 million in fiscal 2004.
Operations As of January31, 2006, we serve all of our customers and users from a single, third-party Web hosting facility located on the west coast of the United States, operated by Equinix, Inc. The facility is built to the same critical systems building codes as hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The facility is secured by around-the-clock guards, biometric access screening and escort-controlled access, and is supported by on-site backup generators in the event of a power failure. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate back-up facility located on the east coast. This strategy is designed to both protect our customers data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster.
Our agreement with Equinix provides for Equinix to supply space in its secure facilities on the west and east coast as well as power. Bandwidth to the Internet is provided by multiple private companies. The initial term of the service agreement with Equinix expires on January 31, 2007 with the ability to renew on favorable terms.
10 Table of Contents We regularly rotate tapes of customer data out of the facilities and store them in a secure location in the event of data loss at the facilities. Additionally, we also have an agreement with SunGard Data Systems, a provider of availability services, to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide us with access to hardware, software and Internet connectivity in the event the Web hosting facilities become unavailable. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted.
We continuously monitor the performance of our service. The monitoring features we have built or licensed include centralized performance consoles, automated load distribution tools and various self-diagnostic tools and programs.
Customers As of January31, 2006, our customer base had grown to approximately 20,500, and we had approximately 399,000 paying subscriptions. As of January31, 2005, our customer base was approximately 13,900 and our paying subscriptions were approximately 227,000.
Our revenues are divided among small businesses (companies with fewer than 200employees), medium-size businesses (200 or more employees and up to $1 billion in annual revenues), and large businesses (over $1 billion in annual revenues). The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to more than 6,000.
None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including North America, Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific region other than Japan.
Direct Sales We sell subscriptions to our service primarily through our direct sales force comprised of inside sales, telesales and field sales personnel. Our small business, general business and enterprise account executives and account managers focus their efforts on small, medium-size and large enterprises, respectively. Sales representatives in our small business group sell to smaller companies, primarily over the phone.
Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to them. These include consulting firms, other technology vendors and systems integrators. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We have also started to develop distribution channels for our service.
Marketing Our marketing strategy is to generate qualified sales leads, build our brand and raise awareness of salesforce.com as a leading provider of on-demand CRM application services. Our marketing programs include a variety of advertising, events, public relations activities and Web-based campaigns targeted at key executives and decision makers within businesses.
Our principal marketing initiatives include:  launch events to publicize our service to existing customers and prospects;  direct mail and email campaigns;  participation in, and sponsorship of, user conferences, trade shows and industry events; 11 Table of Contents  cooperative marketing efforts with partners, including Web link exchanges, joint press announcements, joint trade show activities, channel marketing campaigns and joint seminars;  using our website to offer free trials of our service and to provide product and company information; and  advertising in newspapers, CRM trade magazines, management journals and other business-related periodicals.
Customer Service and Support We believe that superior customer support is critical to retaining and expanding our customer base. Our customer support groups respond to general customer inquiries, such as questions about the ordering process or the status of an order or payment, technical questions or questions relating to how to use our service, and are available to customers by telephone or email or over the Web.
We have a comprehensive technical support program to assist our customers in the use of our service and to identify, analyze and solve any problems or issues with our service. The support program includes email support, an online repository of helpful information about our service, shared best practices for implementation and use, and telephone support. Telephone support is provided by technical support specialists on our staff, who are extensively trained in the use of our service. In addition, we have supplemented our support specialists with other technical support specialists who work for us on a contract basis. Basic customer support during business hours is available at no charge to customers that purchase our Team Edition, Professional Edition or Enterprise Edition. Premium customer support that includes additional customer support is available for an additional charge.
International Sales In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we generated approximately 20 percent, 20percent and 18 percent of our total revenues, respectively, from customers in Europe and Asia Pacific. We expect international markets to provide increased opportunities for our applications and services in the future. Our current international efforts are focused on strengthening our direct sales and marketing presence in Europe and Asia Pacific, and generating more revenues from these regions.
Competition The market for CRM applications and enterprise business applications generally, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software, whose software is installed by the customer directly or hosted by a first generation ASP on the customers behalf, and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and/or bundle CRM products with their products in the future. Our current principal competitors include:  enterprise software application vendors including Amdocs Limited, SSA Global Technologies, Inc., which recently acquired E.piphany, Inc., Epicor, IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, SAP AG, and Oracle Corporation, which recently acquired Siebel Systems, Inc.;  packaged CRM software vendors, some of whom offer hosted services, such as FrontRange Solutions, Inc., Onyx Software Corp., Pivotal Corporation, which is owned by CDC Software Corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, Sage Group plc, and SugarCRM;  on-demand CRM application service providers such as Oracle, SAP, NetSuite, Inc., RightNow Technologies, Inc., and Salesnet, Inc.; and  enterprise application service providers including British Telecom and IBM.
12 Table of Contents We believe that as enterprise software application vendors shift more of their focus to the hosted applications market, particularly for CRM and the small to medium sized business market, these vendors will be a greater competitive threat.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:  speed and ease of implementation;  ease of use and rates of user adoption;  low total cost of ownership and demonstrable cost-effective benefits for customers;  product functionality;  performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of the service;  ease of integration with existing applications;  quality of customer support;  availability and quality of implementation, consulting and training services;  vendor reputation;  sales and marketing capabilities of the vendor; and  financial stability of the vendor.
While some of our competitors offer CRM applications with greater complexity than our service, we believe none of them addresses all of the limitations of traditional CRM applications adequately. In many cases, we believe CRM applications with greater complexity have a higher total cost of ownership, take significantly more time to implement and are harder to use than our service. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs. Additionally, our competitors may offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance.
Our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators, including Accenture Ltd., BearingPoint, Inc. and IBM as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in CRM implementations. We have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them, even as we compete for business in other customer engagements.
Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have U.S. and international patent applications pending and no issued patents. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information.
The following are some of our registered trademarks in the U.S. and elsewhere: salesforce.com No Software logo The End of Software Success. Not Software Team Edition 13 Table of Contents Unregistered trademarks we use include: Block S logo Success On Demand.
sforce experience success.
AppExchange CRMSuccess The Business Web We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, may require us to seek licenses to that technology. In addition, we license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our services. Licenses from third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, or at all. Additionally, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our services. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could offer similar services, potentially significantly harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues.
Employees As of January31, 2006, we had 1,304 employees. We plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in customer-related areas, for the foreseeable future as we continue to execute on our growth plan.
We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. However, we face competition for qualified employees, and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our on-demand application service is not widely accepted, our operating results will be harmed.
We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our on-demand application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future growth and success. Factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include:  reluctance by enterprises to migrate to an on-demand application service;  a limited number of service offerings and risks associated with developing new service offerings;  the price and performance of our service;  the level of customization we can offer;  the availability, performance and price of competing products and services; 14 Table of Contents  reluctance by enterprises to trust third parties to store and manage their internal data; and  adverse publicity about us, our service or the viability, reliability or security of on-demand application services generally from third party reviews, industry analyst reports and adverse statements made by competitors.
Many of these factors are beyond our control. The inability of our on-demand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business.
Defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability.
Because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.
Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party Web hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.
As of January31, 2006, we serve all of our customers from a single, third-party Web hosting facility located on the west coast of the United States, operated by Equinix, Inc. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate standby Equinix facility located on the east coast. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition to the west coast and east coast facilities, we have an agreement with SunGard Data Systems, a provider of availability services, to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide us with access to hardware, software and Internet connectivity in the event the Web hosting facilities become unavailable. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted.
As we continue to add data center capacity, we may move or transfer data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. Further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.
We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service.
We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from Oracle Corporation. This hardware and software may not continue 15 Table of Contents to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business.
If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities.
Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers.
The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.
The market for CRM applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, several of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed. Some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.
Our current principal competitors include:  enterprise software application vendors including Amdocs Limited, SSA Global Technologies, Inc., which recently acquired E.piphany, Inc., Epicor, IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, SAP AG, and Oracle Corporation, which recently acquired Siebel Systems, Inc.;  packaged CRM software vendors, some of whom offer hosted services, such as FrontRange Solutions, Inc., Onyx Software Corp., Pivotal Corporation, which is owned by CDC Software Corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, Sage Group plc, and SugarCRM;  on-demand CRM application service providers such as Oracle, SAP, NetSuite, Inc., RightNow Technologies, Inc., and Salesnet, Inc.; and  enterprise application service providers including British Telecom and IBM.
In addition, we face competition from businesses that develop their own CRM applications internally, as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and/or bundle CRM products with their products in the future. For small business customers, we also face competition from companies whose offering is based on Microsoft Outlook and Excel for limited contact management functionality.
We also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged CRM software vendors, but who also have directly competitive on-demand CRM application services offerings, such as Siebel Systems Siebel CRM OnDemand, which was acquired by Oracle. Our 16 Table of Contents professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators, including Accenture Ltd., BearingPoint, Inc. and IBM, as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in CRM implementations. We have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them, even as we compete for business in other customer engagements.
Many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers.
As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.
If we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations, our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice.
Due to our limited operating history, our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations.
As a result, we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance.
Our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.
Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:  the requirement to begin expensing stock options on February1, 2006, which is the start of our fiscal 2007;  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements;  the renewal rates for our service;  changes in our pricing policies;  the introduction of new features to our service;  the rate of expansion and effectiveness of our sales force;  the length of the sales cycle for our service;  new product and service introductions by our competitors;  our success in selling our service to large enterprises;  variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; 17 Table of Contents  technical difficulties or interruptions in our service;  expenses related to our new data centers;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  changes in tax rates and adjustments to the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets;  general economic conditions in our geographic markets;  the timing of additional investments in our on-demand application service and in our consulting service;  regulatory compliance costs;  payment defaults by customers;  costs associated with future acquisitions of companies and technologies; and  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.
Some of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future.
We incurred significant losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in February 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we have begun generating profits only since fiscal 2003. As we are a relatively young company in an emerging market and with the new requirement to begin expensing stock options in fiscal 2007, we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may again incur significant operating losses in the future. In addition, we expect our costs and operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. If our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs and operating expenses, we will not continue to be profitable. You should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. In fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline. Furthermore, if our costs and operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected.
Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
The market for our technology delivery model and on-demand application services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be harmed.
The market for on-demand application services is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand application services in general, and for CRM in particular. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel 18 Table of Contents and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an on-demand application service. Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of on-demand application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, as a new company in this unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business.
Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. In fiscal 2006, we introduced the AppExchange directory, a central online marketplace for on-demand applications that we host for our customers, developers and partners to exchange custom on-demand applications that are built on, or can integrate with, our service. These custom applications, some of which are not CRM-related, include applications ranging from expense management to purchasing to recruiting. Although we do not presently charge for use of the AppExchange directory, it is uncertain whether this service will be accepted and adopted by our customers, developers and partners or will increase the demand for subscriptions to our service.
We do not have an adequate history with our subscription model to predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results.
Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact, some customers have elected not to do so. In addition, our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates. Our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.
Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. If these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer.
Our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.
We are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas.
Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any 19 Table of Contents future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan.
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses, which have a greater rate of attrition and non-renewal than medium-sized and large enterprise customers.
Our small business customers, which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees, typically have shorter initial subscription periods and, based on our limited experience to date, have had a higher rate of attrition and non-renewal as compared to our medium-sized and large enterprise customers. If we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough, our revenue could decline.
Our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large customers.
Our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large businesses. Our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful. In particular, because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history, these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical CRM applications from one of our larger, more established competitors. Even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers, they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service, which could harm our business.
As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers, all of which could harm our business.
As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our service. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. In addition, larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable.
If we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed.
If we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and 20 Table of Contents development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.
Any efforts we may make in the future to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed.
To date, we have focused our business on providing on-demand application services for the CRM market, but we may in the future seek to expand into other markets. In addition, we recently launched the AppExchange directory, an on-line marketplace for on-demand applications running on our on-demand application service platform. However, any efforts to expand beyond the CRM market may never result in significant revenue growth for us. In addition, efforts to expand our on-demand application service beyond the CRM market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which may harm our business.
If we acquire any companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.
As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies in the future. Through January31, 2006, we have not made any acquisitions or investments to date, and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;  risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments;  potential loss of key employees;  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue;  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses; and  the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies.
In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of our common stock may decline.
If we fail to develop our brand cost-effectively, our business may suffer.
We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense. Brand promotion activities 21 Table of Contents may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.
Failure to adequately expand our direct sales force and develop and expand our indirect sales channel will impede our growth.
We continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers, particularly large enterprise customers, and to manage our customer base. We believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded. In addition, we plan to develop and expand our indirect sales channel by engaging third-party resellers. Because of our on-demand service model, the structuring of such relationships is complex and requires the investment of significant business, financial and other resources. If we are unable to structure successful third-party channel relationships that enable us to enter markets we otherwise would have greater difficulty entering, our growth will be inhibited.
Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales.
Because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States. For example, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2006, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include:  localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;  laws and business practices favoring local competitors;  compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;  foreign currency fluctuations, whose effects we may not be able to mitigate through our hedging program;  different pricing environments;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property;  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; and  regional economic and political conditions.
Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Additionally, some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in U.S. dollars and paid in local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business.
22 Table of Contents Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have U.S. and international patent applications pending, we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection for our technology. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.
We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.
We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. An adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others.
We may be required to purchase the interest in our Japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner, under certain circumstances, on terms that may not be favorable to us.
In some circumstances, we may be required to purchase the interest of our Japanese joint venture partner. If we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner, or if we and our partner disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues, then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture. In the event we are required to purchase our partners interest in the joint venture, we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital, which could harm our financial condition. Although the timing and circumstances of any such purchase, were it to be required, are not predictable, if the joint venture were valued based on its most recent financing, which occurred in September 2003, the buyout price could be as much as approximately $13.0 million.
Evolving regulation of the Internet may affect us adversely.
As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for CRM solutions and 23 Table of Contents restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.
Privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business.
Our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. For example, regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service.
The European Union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. All of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service.
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, CRM solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business.
Our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.
We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Stock Exchange and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, that are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. Our efforts to comply with these new regulations, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
We are required to comply on an on-going basis with the SOX requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent public accountants audit of that assessment. These requirements first became applicable to us on January31, 2006. Our efforts to comply with the SOX requirements has required, and will continue to require the commitment of significant financial and personnel resources.
Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed.
24 Table of Contents We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.
Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Marc Benioff, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Steve Cakebread, our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Steele, our President of Worldwide Sales and Distribution, Parker Harris, our Executive Vice President of Technology, Ken Juster, our Executive Vice President of Law, Policy and Corporate Strategy, and John Freeland, our President of Worldwide Operations. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.
Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.
To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services and senior sales executives. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. Furthermore, the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock options awards that job candidates require to join our company. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
We might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.
We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.
Changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our reported results of operations.
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, announced its decision to require companies to expense employee stock options. The pro forma disclosures that the FASB previously permitted 25 Table of Contents will no longer be an alternative to the financial statement recognition of the expense. We will adopt this new accounting pronouncement, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , on a prospective basis beginning on February1, 2006, which is the start of our fiscal 2007. We believe this change in accounting will materially reduce our fiscal 2007 reported results of operations.
Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions.
We expect our tax rate in fiscal 2007 to be significantly higher than in previous years. The tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the tax accounting for option activities pursuant to the new requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.
The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Further, our common stock has a limited trading history. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include:  variations in our operating results and cash flows;  the quarterly net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions;  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;  customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;  recruitment or departure of key personnel;  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;  market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems or due to a natural disaster, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event.
In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation, such as the lawsuits following the approximately 25% decline in our stock price on July21, 2004, which may harm our business and results of operations.
If securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.
The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. Furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.
26 Table of Contents The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.
Our executive officers, directors, current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.
Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:  establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;  provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2 / 3 percent of our stockholders;  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;  eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
In addition, Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
27 Table of Contents ITEM2. PROPERTIES Our executive offices and principal office for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development occupy in excess of 200,000 square feet in San Francisco, California under leases that expire at various times through June 2013. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel.
We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our lease commitments. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On July26, 2004, a purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Morrison v. salesforce.com, inc. et al.
, against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. The complaint alleged violations of Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act), purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased salesforce.com common stock between June21, 2004 and July21, 2004, inclusive. The claims were based upon allegations that defendants failed to disclose an allegedly declining trend in its revenues and earnings. Subsequently, four other substantially similar class action complaints were filed in the same district based upon the same facts and allegations, asserting claims under Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the 1934 Act and Section11 and Section15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The actions were consolidated under the caption In re salesforce.com, inc. Securities Litigation , Case No. C-04-3009 JSW (N.D. Cal.). On December22, 2004, the Court appointed Chuo Zhu as lead plaintiff. On February22, 2005, lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint (the CAC). The CAC alleged violations of Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the 1934 Act, purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased salesforce.com common stock between June23, 2004 and July21, 2004, inclusive. As in the original complaints, the claims in the CAC were based upon allegations that defendants failed to disclose an allegedly declining trend in its revenues and earnings. On April14, 2005, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the CAC. On April15, 2005, the Court granted lead plaintiff leave to file an amended/superseding complaint. On April22, 2005, lead plaintiff filed a Corrected and Superceding [sic] First Amended Class Action Complaint (FAC). As in the CAC, the FAC alleged violations of Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the 1934 Act, purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased salesforce.com common stock between June23, 2004 and July21, 2004, inclusive. The claims in the FAC were based upon allegations that defendants failed to disclose an internal forecast that earnings for fiscal year 2005 would decline from the prior fiscal year. On April29, 2005, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the FAC. On December22, 2005, the court entered an order granting defendants motion to dismiss, with prejudice, and directing the clerk to close the file. On January23, 2006, lead plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration, as well as a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On January27, 2006, defendants filed a motion to strike as untimely lead plaintiffs motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration. On January26, 2006, the Ninth Circuit entered a time schedule order for the appeal, requiring, inter alia , lead plaintiff to file his opening brief on May11, 2006, and defendants to file their responsive brief on June12, 2006. On or about February2, 2006, lead plaintiff filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit requesting a stay of appellate proceedings pending the district courts determination of lead plaintiffs motion for leave and defendants motion to strike. Defendants opposed that motion. On February 9, 2006, the Ninth Circuit denied the lead plaintiffs motion for a stay of appellate proceedings, without prejudice to making a motion for limited remand. On March 1, 2006, the district court denied the lead plaintiffs motion for leave and defendants motion to strike on grounds of lack of jurisdiction. Also on March 1, 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a motion with the district court seeking certification to the Ninth Circuit for limited remand. The Company does not believe that the lawsuit has any merit and intends to continue to defend the action and appeal vigorously.
28 Table of Contents On August6, 2004, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, San Francisco County, entitled Borrelli v. Benioff, et al.
, against the Companys Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and members of its Board of Directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment under state common law. Subsequently, a substantially similar complaint was filed in the same court based on the same facts and allegations, entitled Johnson v. Benioff, et al.
The two actions were consolidated under the caption Borrelli v. Benioff , Case No. CGC-04-433615 (Cal. Super. Ct., S.F. Cty.). On October5, 2004, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint, which is based upon the same facts and circumstances as alleged in the shareholder class action discussed above, and asserts that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by making or failing to prevent salesforce.com, inc. and its management from making statements or omissions that potentially subject the Company to liability and injury to its reputation. The action seeks damages on behalf of salesforce.com in an unspecified amount, among other forms of legal and equitable relief. salesforce.com is named solely as a nominal defendant against which no recovery is sought. The plaintiff shareholders made no demand upon the Board of Directors prior to filing these actions. The deadline for defendants to respond to the consolidated complaint has been extended repeatedly by agreement of the parties, and is now set for June15, 2006. During this time, no discovery or other proceedings have occurred in this case. The derivative action is still in the preliminary stages, and it is not possible for the Company to quantify the extent of potential liability to the individual defendants, if any. Management does not believe that the lawsuits have any merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously.
Additionally, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. In our opinion, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or our financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors Which May Impact Future Operating Results. We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors.
Overview We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to an August 2005 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide.
We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on-demand CRM application service in February 2000.
In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions. We plan to re-invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center; hiring additional personnel, particularly in customer-related areas; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. Additionally, in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may also in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies.
As our revenues increase, we expect marketing and sales costs, which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 55 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor.
34 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January31. References to fiscal 2006, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January31, 2006.
Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on-demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2)related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2006 and 90 percent during the same period a year ago. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2006 and 2005.
Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.
Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30days of invoice.
Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues . Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of additional data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software. To date, the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges, employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on-demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services.
To the extent that our customer base grows, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services. We have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the United States. We expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant.
Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, the costs of upgrading our new development and test data center and allocated overhead. We have 35 Table of Contents historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on-demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.
We recently upgraded our new development and test data center. We expect the annual cost of this data center to be significant.
Marketing and Sales . Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities.
As our revenues increase, we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost.
General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business, international expansion and operations as a public company, including the cost of our compliance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Stock-Based Expenses . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non-employees, option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services. These charges have been significant and are reflected in our historical financial results. These amounts do not include the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options, which we will adopt at the start of fiscal 2007.
Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January31, 2006, we owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the ventures financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors interest in the ventures results, exclusive of intercompany charges. Through January31, 2006, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture had not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make 36 Table of Contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition . We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.104, Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1)there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2)the service has been provided to the customer; (3)the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4)the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return.
We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term.
Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately.
In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $1,686,000 at January31, 2006 and $874,000 at January31, 2005.
Accounting for Deferred Commissions.
We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the 37 Table of Contents commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.
During fiscal 2006, we deferred $22.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $14.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $14.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $15.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $17.1 million at January31, 2006 and $9.6 million at January31, 2005.
Accounting for Stock-Based Awards.
We recorded deferred stock-based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. We have elected not to record stock-based compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. Prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock in June 2004, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, our operating and financial performance, private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties, issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm. The fair value of our common stock is now determined by the trading price of our stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
We amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the four-year vesting period of the underlying option awards. As of January31, 2006, we had an aggregate of $2.5 million of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized.
On February1, 2006, which is the start of our fiscal 2007, we will begin to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , or SFAS 123R (see Recent Accounting Pronouncement below for further discussion). We believe that the adoption of SFAS 123R will materially reduce our fiscal 2007 reported results of operations.
In the past, we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to non-employees. For these options and warrants, we recognize stock-based compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards, based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. As of January31, 2006, we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to non-employees except for options for 50,000 shares of our common stock, all of which will fully vest by July 2007 and have an exercise price of $2.50 per share.
Accounting for Income Taxes.
We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, tax exposure items or adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur.
Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. During fiscal 2006, we recorded anincome tax benefit of $1.3 million, which included a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets. The Company continues to maintain a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. Future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity, which was approximately $40.0 million of the total valuation allowance as of January 31, 2006, will be recorded to additional paid-in capital.

The total number of paying subscribers increased to approximately 399,000 as of January31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January31, 2005.
Our gross profit during the year ended January31, 2006 was $240.7 million, or 78 percent of revenues, and operating income was $20.1 million. Operating income for the period included a non-cash stock-based expense of $3.4 million, which consisted primarily of the amortization of our deferred stock-based compensation. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $142.9 million, or 81 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $6.5 million. Operating income during the year ended January31, 2005 also included $3.6 million of non-cash stock-based expense.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $6.8 million by reducing our valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets. This determination was primarily based on our cumulative profitability over the past several quarters plus the projected current and future taxable income that we expect to realize, particularly in specific tax jurisdictions such as the United States.
Additionally, during fiscal 2006, we incurred substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business. We incurred costs related to adding data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center. Additionally, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the penetration within our existing customer base, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, and developers to broaden and enhance our on-demand service.
During the year ended January31, 2006, we generated $95.9 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $55.9 million during the same period a year ago. At January31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $296.8 million, as compared to $205.9 million at January31, 2005, accounts receivable of $76.1 million at January31, 2006, as compared to $48.9 million at January31, 2005, and deferred revenue of $169.2 million at January31, 2006, as compared to $95.9 million at January31, 2005.
Fiscal Years Ended January31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues.
Total revenues were $309.9 million for the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $176.4 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $133.5 million, or 76 percent. Subscription and support 41 Table of Contents revenues were $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 399,000 as of January31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January31, 2005. Professional services and other revenues were $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers.
Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $27.3 million, or 77 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities.
Cost of Revenues . Cost of revenues was $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $35.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $14.6 million in employee-related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 60 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January31, 2005, an increase of $11.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $3.3 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.3 million in allocated overhead charges. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during the year ended January31, 2006 by $5.5 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded.
As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses, together with the requirement to expense stock options beginning in fiscal 2007, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We believe that our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will approximate recent percentages, exclusive of the new requirement to expense stock options.
Research and Development . Research and development expenses were $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $13.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $7.7 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.6 million in equipment and service costs primarily due to upgrading our new development and test data center and a $1.6 million increase in allocated overhead charges. We increased our research and development headcount by 77 percent since January31, 2005 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. During the year ended January31, 2006, we capitalized $1.4 million in development costs associated with planned releases of our application service.
Marketing and Sales . Marketing and sales expenses were $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $53.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million in employee-related costs, $5.0 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings, advertising and events and a $9.1 million increase in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 72 percent since January31, 2005 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.
General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses were $48.0 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January31, 2006, compared to $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, 42 Table of Contents during the same period a year ago, an increase of $17.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22.2 million in employee-related costs, $4.1 million in professional and outside service costs and $4.5 million in infrastructure-related costs, which were offset by $15.0 million in increased allocated charges to non-general and administrative departments. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 69 percent since January31, 2005 as we added personnel to support our growth.
Lease Recovery.
The lease recovery of $285,000, which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a $285,000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space.
Operating Income.
Operating income during the year ended January31, 2006 was $20.1 million. During the same period a year ago, it was $6.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re-invested in an effort to expand our business.
Interest Income . Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. During the year ended January31, 2005, interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February28, 2005. Interest income was $7.7 million during the year ended January31, 2006 and was $2.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the $113.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004 and the cash generated by operating activities since January31, 2005.
Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes . We recorded a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the year ended January31, 2006, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.2 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the $1.3 million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling $7.2 million. Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. As of January31, 2006, we had $7.2 million of deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheet.
As of the same date, the Company continues to maintain a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. Future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity, which was approximately $40.0 million of the total valuation allowance as of January 31, 2006, will be recorded to additional paid-in-capital. To realize the deferred tax assets related to foreign operations, pretax income in those jurisdictions must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized. Historic profits in those jurisdictions have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date.
Without the reduction in our valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 would have been approximately 20 percent. This effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized.
We currently believe that our fiscal 2007 effective tax rate will be significantly higher than in fiscal 2006. Our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of full-year income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate, the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction and the impact of the new accounting requirement to expense stock options. The estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items. These actual results could vary from those projected.
43 Table of Contents Fiscal Years Ended January31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues.
Total revenues were $176.4 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $96.0 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of $80.4 million, or 84 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $85.8 million, or 89 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 227,000 as of January31, 2005 from approximately 127,000 as of January31, 2004. Professional services and other revenues were $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $10.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers.
Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.1 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $18.4 million, or 108 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities.
Cost of Revenues . Cost of revenues was $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.3 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $16.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily comprised of an increase of $12.1 million in employee-related costs, substantially all of which was due to the 80 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 million in service delivery costs and an increase of $1.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2005 by $2.3 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded.
The increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve the increased number of customers and paying subscribers.
Research and Development . Research and development expenses were $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $7.0 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $2.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $2.3 million and an increase of $0.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 57 percent since January31, 2004 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.
Marketing and Sales . Marketing and sales expenses were $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $54.6 million, or 57 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $41.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $34.3 million in employee-related costs, $3.5 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings and event costs and $3.4 million in allocated overhead. Of the $34.3 million increase in employee-related costs, $7.0 million was related to the increased amortization expense of deferred commissions. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 76 percent since January31, 2004 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.
General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses were $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $16.9 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $13.4 million. The increase was due to an increase of $8.3million in employee-related costs and $5.1 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 64 percent since January31, 2004 as we added personnel to support our growth. The increase in professional and 44 Table of Contents outside service costs was due to the cost of being a public company and the added costs of managing a growing business and expanding outside the United States.
Lease Recovery.
The lease recovery of $3.4 million during fiscal 2004 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In August 2003, we entered into an agreement, releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned, in connection with the landlords lease of this space to another tenant. Accordingly, we recorded a $3.4 million credit to reflect the reversal of the accrual that was directly related with this space.
Operating Income.
Operating income during fiscal 2005 was $6.5 million. During fiscal 2004, it was $3.7 million, substantially all of which consisted of the lease recovery described above. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re-invested in an effort to expand our business.
Interest Income . Interest income substantially consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and also includes interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February28, 2005. Interest income was $2.7 million during fiscal 2005 and was $379,000 during fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004.
Provision for Income Taxes . We recorded a provision for income tax expense of $1.2 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to a provision for income tax expense of $541,000 for fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 provision for income taxes consists of amounts accrued for our estimated domestic federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax liability as well as an estimate of our foreign income tax expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources At January31, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million and accounts receivable of $76.1 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $95.9 million during the year ended January31, 2006 and $55.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock-based awards.
Net cash used in investing activities was $47.8 million during the year ended January31, 2006 and $149.2 million during the same period a year ago, which included the investment of most of the proceeds from our initial public offering in June 2004. The net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January31, 2006 primarily related to the changes in restricted cash balances and marketable securities and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force.
In February 2005, we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of $8.8 million, which included the cost for support for the first year of the license agreement. Additionally, we obtained additional data center capacity and we upgraded our new development and test data center. For these data center resources, our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for the facilities and computer equipment and contracts for certain services.
45 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $15.8 million during the year ended January31, 2006 and $118.9 million during the same period a year ago. In June 2004, we completed the sale of 11.5million shares of common stock during our initial public offering. The net proceeds from the initial public offering were $113.8 million. During the year ended January31, 2006, the $15.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and the $727,000 of proceeds from the collection of notes receivable from shareholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations.
As of January31, 2006, we have a total of $3.4 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, Switzerland and Singapore. None of these letters of credit are collateralized. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2010.
We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit.
Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for additional data center capacity and the new development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long-term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January31, 2006, the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long-term liability were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Lessthan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Morethan 5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 825 $ 638 $ 187 $  $  Operating lease obligations: Office space 76,603 20,522 23,624 19,155 13,302 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 49,250 20,758 28,362 130  Contractual commitments 350 350    Lease abandonment liabilities and other 1,341 186 762 393  Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.
Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with Web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing.
46 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.
Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , or SFAS 123R, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R on February1, 2006, which is the start of our next fiscal year.
We believe that the adoption of SFAS 123R will materially reduce our reported results of operations. The full impact is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when additional employees that we plan to hire commence employment, the outcome of our current assessment of different long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Had we adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the total stock-based expense for all awards before the tax benefit would have approximated the pro forma impact of expensing options as described in Note 1 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, SFAS 123R requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. We currently classify these tax benefits as a source of cash provided by operating activities. These benefits totaled $3,662,000 during the year ended January31, 2006 and $798,000 for the comparable period a year ago.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British PoundSterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million at January31, 2006. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in a $1.6 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.
At January 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $1.6 million.

/s/E RNST & Y OUNG LLP San Francisco, California March 15, 2006 49 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of salesforce.com, inc.
We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that salesforce.com, inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Salesforce.coms management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that salesforce.com, inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of salesforce.com, inc. as of January31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January31, 2006 and our report dated March 15, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand. It provides a comprehensive customer relationship management (CRM) service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. The Company began to offer its on-demand application service on a subscription basis in February 2000. The Company conducts its business worldwide.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January31. References to fiscal 2006, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January31, 2006.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of the provision for income taxes and the fair value of stock awards issued. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Additionally, the Company holds a majority interest in Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (Salesforce Japan), a Japanese joint venture. As of January31, 2006, the Company owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture. Given the Companys majority ownership interest in the joint venture, the accounts of the joint venture have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a minority interest, net of intercompany charges, has been recorded for the minority investors interests in the net assets and operations of the joint venture to the extent of the minority investors individual investments. Additionally, the Company records gains and losses resulting from the change of interest in Salesforce Japan directly to stockholders equity as additional paid-in capital.
Segments The Company operates in one segment.
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as part of a separate component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date as quoted currently on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates.
57 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with problem accounts.
The Companys accounts receivable and net revenues are derived from a large number of direct customers. No customer accounted for more than 5 percent of accounts receivable at January31, 2006 and 2005. No single customer accounted for 5 percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.
As of January31, 2006 and 2005, assets located outside the Americas were 6 percent and 8percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2006 2005 2004 Revenues by geography: Americas $ 247,009 $ 140,871 $ 78,958 Europe 43,577 25,201 11,754 Asia Pacific 19,271 10,303 5,311 $ 309,857 $ 176,375 $ 96,023 As of January31, 2006, the Company serves all of its customers and users from a single, third-party Web hosting facility located on the west coast of the United States, operated by Equinix, Inc. As part of the Companys current disaster recovery arrangements, the existing production environment and all of the customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a separate back-up Equinix facility located on the east coast. The Company does not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption. The Company also has an agreement with SunGard Data Systems, a provider of availability services, to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide the Company with access to hardware, software and Internet connectivity in the event the Web hosting facilities become unavailable. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, the Companys service could be interrupted.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and money market funds, are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities, which are classified as available for sale at January31, 2006 and 2005, are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of interest income.
58 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Companys financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued expenses, approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of capital lease obligations approximates fair value.
Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: Computers, equipment, and software 3 to 5 years Furniture and fixtures 5 to 7 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated useful life of 5 years or the lease term When assets are retired, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. When assets are otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in other income.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
In addition to the recoverability assessment, the Company routinely reviews the remaining estimated lives of its long-lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the period when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent periods.
Software and Website Development Costs The Company follows the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs (EITF 00-2), and EITF Issue No. 00-3, Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entitys Hardware (EITF 00-3). EITF 00-2 sets forth the accounting for website development costs based on the website development activity. EITF 00-3 sets forth the accounting for software in a hosting arrangement. As such, the Company follows the guidance set forth in Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use (SOP 98-1), in accounting for the development of its on-demand application service. SOP 98-1 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage and amortize them over the softwares estimated useful life of three years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) The Company capitalized $1,352,000, $465,000 and $453,000 in internal use software during fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Amortization expense totaled $443,000, $396,000 and $277,000 during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income. Specifically, cumulative foreign currency translation and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities adjustments, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Comprehensive income has been reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity.
The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows (in thousands): January31, 2006 2005 Foreign currency translation adjustments $ (537 ) $ (250 ) Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale marketable securities (1,568 ) (749 ) $ (2,105 ) $ (999 ) Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123) and SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure.
Under APB 25, compensation expense of fixed stock options is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant between the fair value of the Companys stock and the exercise price of the option. Prior to the establishment of a public market for the Companys common stock in June 2004, the Companys board of directors determined the fair value based on several factors. Since the Companys initial public offering in June 2004, the fair value is determined by the trading price of the Companys common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the option-vesting period of four years.

Pro forma information regarding the results of operations is determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options using the fair-value method. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes method with the following assumptions: Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2006 2005 2004 Volatility 50 - 75% 75-100% 100% Weighted-average estimated life 4 years 4 years 4years Weighted-average risk-free interest rate 3.79-4.52% 2.86-3.70% 2.92% Dividend yield    60 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reevaluated the assumptions used to estimate the future volatility of its stock price. The Company estimated its future stock price volatility based upon a blending of both observed option-implied volatilities and historical volatility calculations for both the Company and a group of peer comparable companies. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the 4 year weighted-average expected life of its option grants. During the Companys initial year as a public company, the volatility assumption was primarily based on the historical volatility of comparable companies. As a result of its reevaluation and the general market decline in share price volatilities, the Company reduced its volatility assumption from 75% to 50% and applied this estimate in valuing the options awarded during the remainder of fiscal 2006.
Had compensation cost for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been determined using the fair-value method at the grant date for awards under those plans calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model and recognized on a straight-line basis over the option vesting periods, the Companys net income would have been decreased to the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands, except per share data): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income, as reported $ 28,474 $ 7,346 $ 3,514 Add: Total stock-based compensation expense included in the determination of net income 2,765 3,298 3,765 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair-value-based method for all awards.

Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock, including options, warrants and convertible preferred stock prior to the completion of the Companys initial public offering in June 2004.

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established or adjusted when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The tax expense or benefits for unusual items or tax exposure items are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur.
Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing its on-demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2)related professional services and other revenue. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Because the Company 62 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) provides its application as a service, the Company follows the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.104, Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables . The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met:  There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  The service has been provided to the customer;  The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and  The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
The Companys arrangements do not contain general rights of return.
Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Professional services and other revenues, when sold with subscription and support offerings, are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of the Companys consulting contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, the Company allocates the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately.
In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, the Company considers the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations, the Company defers only the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortizes those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. As of January31, 2006 and January31, 2005, the deferred cost on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaled $1,686,000 and $874,000, respectively. These deferred costs are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets.
On occasion, the Company has purchased from its suppliers goods or services for the Companys use in its operations at or around the same time these same businesses entered into subscription and/or consulting agreements. The Company generally defines at or around the same time as within six months. Revenues recognized from customers who were also suppliers were not significant during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. Both the procurement and revenue agreements are separately negotiated, settled ultimately in cash, and recorded at what the Company considers to be fair value. When any of these factors is not present, the Company does not recognize the revenue from the underlying sale agreements; rather, the revenue is netted with expenses.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the Companys subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices its customers in annual or quarterly installments. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, noncancelable subscription agreements.
Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with noncancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the noncancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Warranties and Indemnification The Companys on-demand application service is typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances.
The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company has entered into service level agreements with a small number of its customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits or terminate their agreements in the event that the Company fails to meet those levels. During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a provision of approximately $1.1 million for potential credits and paid out no amounts. As of January31, 2006, the reserve balance was approximately $1.4 million.
The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $12,932,000, $6,908,000 and $5,048,000 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , or SFAS 123R, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R on February1, 2006, which is the start of its next fiscal year.
The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS 123R will materially reduce the Companys reported results of operations. The full impact is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when additional employees that the Company plans to hire commence employment, the outcome of the Companys current assessment of different long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant and the tax benefit that the Company may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Had the Company adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the total stock-based expense for all awards before the tax benefit would have approximated the impact of expensing options as described above in the disclosure of pro forma net income (loss)and net income (loss)per share.
Additionally, SFAS 123R requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company currently classifies these tax benefits as a source of cash provided by operating activities. These benefits totaled $3,662,000, $798,000 and zero during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
2. Joint Venture On December7, 2000, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to establish Salesforce Japan. As of January31, 2006 and 2005, the Company owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture. Provided that the Company owns at least 30 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the joint venture, the Company has the right to appoint three of the six board members of the joint venture, and together with SunBridge, may appoint a fourth director.
The Board of Directors of the joint venture has authorized option plans to purchase shares in Salesforce Japan. The option plans are in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Commercial Code of Japan. One of the option plans includes antidilution provisions such that the option holders are allowed additional options if the joint venture issues additional stock and the exercise price of their options is reduced if the additional stock is issued for an amount less than such exercise price. These provisions result in variable accounting for this plan, as the number of options awarded is not fixed and no measurement date currently exists.
In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the joint venture granted options to purchase 23,600, 10,000 and 3,000 shares, respectively, to its employees to purchase shares of common stock in the joint venture. The stock options were issued with an exercise price of 4,000 per share (approximately $34 per share), 4,000 per share (approximately $37 per share) and 3,500 per share (approximately $31 per share) and vest over a two-year period. As a result of these stock option grants, the joint venture recorded zero, $88,000 and $13,000 of deferred stock-based compensation during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The joint venture amortized $7,000, $23,000 and $274,000 of deferred stock-based compensation expense during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The joint venture reversed $30,000, $2,000 and zero of unamortized deferred stock-based compensation related to terminated employees during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additionally, as a result of an employee termination, during fiscal 2006 and 2005 the joint venture reversed compensation expense of $20,000 and $475,000, respectively, which had been previously recognized.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Given the Companys majority ownership interest in the joint venture, the accounts of the joint venture have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a minority interest has been recorded for the third partys interest in the net assets and operations of the joint venture to the extent of the minority partners individual investments. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated, with the exception of minority interest.
Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, the joint venture will terminate if the joint venture becomes a public company or is sold to a third party, or upon the mutual agreement of the parties. In addition, if the Company commits a breach of, or if the Company fails to perform, its material obligations under the joint venture agreement, which are not cured in a timely manner, SunBridge can require the Company to purchase all of its shares in the joint venture. The purchase price for SunBridges shares would be the then fair market value plus a specified premium. In the event that SunBridge commits a breach of, or if it fails to perform, its material obligations under the joint venture agreement, which it does not cure in a timely manner, or if SunBridge enters into bankruptcy proceedings, the Company can require SunBridge to sell to it all of their shares in the joint venture. The purchase price for SunBridges shares would be the then fair market value less a specified discount. Additionally, if the Company and SunBridge are unable to agree on certain operational matters, either party can require the other to purchase all of its shares of the joint venture at a price equal to the then fair value market value. Fair market value is to be determined by mutual agreement of the parties, or if the parties are unable to agree, by an independent appraiser.

A total of $126,500,000 in gross proceeds was raised in this initial public offering. After deducting the underwriting discount of $8,855,000 and offering expenses of $3,877,000, net proceeds were $113,768,000. To date, the Company has not spent any of the net proceeds from the public offering.
Upon the closing of the Companys initial public offering, the 58,024,345 shares of the Companys outstanding convertible preferred stock converted, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of common stock.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been partially offset by a valuation allowance, which increased by $13.6 million in fiscal 2006 and increased by $8.5 million in fiscal 2005. The valuation allowance relates primarily to deferred tax assets arising from employee stock option exercises and operating losses from foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $40.0 million of the valuation allowance at January 31, 2006, related to employee stock options, will be recorded to additional paid-in capital when realized.
At January31, 2006, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $90.0 million, which expire in 2020 through 2026, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $2.3 million, which expire in 2020 through 2026, and minimum tax credits of $72,000, which have no expiration date. The Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $101.0 million which expire beginning in 2007 and state research and development tax credits of approximately $2.5 million which have no expiration date.
Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization.
6. Preferred Stock After the consummation of the initial public offering in June 2004 and the filing of the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. At January31, 2006 and 2005, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.
7. Stockholders Equity Stock Options Issued to Employees The Company has in place the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the 1999 Plan) which provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory options to employees and nonemployees of the Company. As of January31, 2006, there were 1,085,190 shares of common stock available for grant under the 1999 Plan. The 1999 Plan provides for grants of immediately exercisable options; however, the Company has the right to repurchase any unvested common stock upon the termination of employment at the original exercise price.
In addition to the 1999 Plan, the Company maintains the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. These plans, other than the 2004 Outside Directors Plan, provide for annual automatic increases on February1 to the shares reserved for issuance based on the lesser of (i)a specific percentage of the total number of shares outstanding at year end; (ii)a fixed number of shares; or (iii)a lesser number of shares set by the Companys Board of Directors, all as specified in the respective plans. On February1, 2006, 5,000,000 additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the automatic increase. The 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will not be implemented unless and until the Companys Board of Directors authorizes the commencement of one or more offerings under the plan. No offering periods have been authorized to date.

During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded zero, $1,773,000 and $3,627,000, respectively, of deferred stock-based compensation expense related to stock option grants under the 1999 Plan for the excess of the deemed fair market value over the exercise price at the date of grant related to stock options granted to employees. The Company reversed unamortized deferred stock-based compensation related to cancellation of options for terminated employees in the amount of $582,000, $798,000 and $1,212,000 during fiscal 2006, 2005 71 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) and 2004, respectively. The Company amortized $2,758,000, $3,275,000 and $3,491,000 of the deferred stock-based compensation during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The compensation expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the option-vesting period of four years.
During fiscal 2004, the Company accelerated the vesting of certain stock options relating to terminated employees. As a result, the Company recorded compensation expense totaling $146,000. The Company did not accelerate the vesting of any stock options during fiscal 2006 and 2005.

Compensation expense is re-measured as the shares vest and is recorded over the vesting periods. Together with past stock awards to non-employees, such expenses amounted to $279,000, $167,000 and $162,000 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such expense was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 6.00% Contractual lives 18-48months Expected dividend yield 0% Expected volatility 50 - 100% Warrants for Common Stock In August 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of four warrants, each to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock at $1.10 per share to the salesforce.com/foundation (the Foundation), which is a nonprofit related party. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. He, one of the Companys executive officers and one of the Companys board members hold three of the Foundations nine board seats. The warrants are exercisable for one-year terms beginning on the earlier of the initial public offering of the Company or August1, 2003,August1, 2004,August1, 2005, and August1, 2006, respectively. The warrants were issued as a charitable contribution to the Foundation. The warrants were fully vested on the date of grant without any performance obligations by the Foundation. Through January31, 2006, the Foundation exercised 250,000 warrants and as of January31, 2006, the warrants to purchase an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock remain outstanding.

The expense associated with these share issuances was $260,000 and was recognized immediately in fiscal 2004.
During fiscal 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 40,000 shares of common stock to two board members for board services. Of the 40,000 shares, 12,500 shares were distributed pursuant to the terms described in the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. The expense associated with these share issuances was $646,000 and was expensed immediately at the time of the issuances.
During fiscal 2006, a board member received stock grants for a total of 20,000 shares of common stock for board services pursuant to the terms described in the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. The expense associated with these share issuances was $389,000 and was expensed immediately at the time of the issuances.
8. Commitments and Contingencies Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2006, the Company had a total of $3,351,000 in letters of credit outstanding in favor of its landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, Switzerland and Singapore. None of these letters of credit are collateralized.
These letters of credit renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2010.
Leases The Company leases facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates through June 2013.
73 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): Capital Leases Operating Leases Fiscal Year Ended January 31: 2007 $ 638 $ 41,280 2008 180 31,442 2009 7 20,544 2010  9,654 2011  9,631 Thereafter  13,302 Total minimum lease payments 825 $ 125,853 Less: amount representing interest (26 ) Present value of capital lease obligations $ 799 The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on the straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $125.9 million, $76.6 million is related to facilities space. The remaining $49.3 million commitment is related computer equipment and other leases.
Our agreements for the facilities and certain services provide us with the option to renew. Our future contractual obligations would change if we exercised these options.
Rent expense for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $11,434,000, $6,490,000 and $4,686,000, respectively.
In December 2001, the Company abandoned 19,500 square feet of excess office space in San Francisco and recorded a lease abandonment charge of $7,657,000. This amount consisted of the future rent obligations under the operating leases of $11,368,000, offset by projected subtenant income of $3,711,000.
Of the total space abandoned, the Company subleased 7,500 square feet through the remaining term of its operating lease at the original sublease assumptions. Additionally, in August 2003, the Company executed a Third Amendment to Office Lease with its landlord. This agreement modified the original lease such that the total leased space under the amended agreement excluded 7,200 square feet of the space that was abandoned. As a result of this amendment, the Company recorded a reduction in its lease liability of $4,342,000 during the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
At January31, 2004, approximately 5,000 square feet of the 19,500 square feet of office space abandoned in December 2001 remained available for sublease. The operating lease for this remaining space expires in April 2011. Due to the difficulty in securing subtenants to occupy the remaining 5,000 square feet of available office space, the Company lowered its subtenant income assumptions and recorded an additional $897,000 lease abandonment charge in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 operating results.
During fiscal 2005, the Company subleased 700 square feet of available space. At January31, 2005, the remaining liability associated with approximately 4,000 remaining square feet of office space abandoned in December 2001 was $1,531,000 and consisted of the future rental obligation offset by an estimate of projected subtenant income of $919,000.
In March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with its primary landlord that released it from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining 4,000 square feet of San Francisco office space 74 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) that was abandoned in December 2001 in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $285,000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related with this previously abandoned space.
The following table sets forth the lease abandonment activity: Liability balance at January31, 2003 $ 6,335,000 Additions 897,000 Charges utilized, net of subtenant income of $219,000 (919,000 ) Reversals (4,342,000 ) Liability balance at January31, 2004 $ 1,971,000 Charges utilized, net of subtenant income of $124,000 (440,000 ) Liability balance at January31, 2005 $ 1,531,000 Charges utilized, net of subtenant income of $96,000 (298,000 ) Reversals (285,000 ) Liability balance at January31, 2006 $ 948,000 Legal Proceedings On July26, 2004, a purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, entitled Morrison v. salesforce.com, inc. et al.
, against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. The complaint alleged violations of Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act), purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased salesforce.com common stock between June21, 2004 and July21, 2004, inclusive. The claims were based upon allegations that defendants failed to disclose an allegedly declining trend in its revenues and earnings. Subsequently, four other substantially similar class action complaints were filed in the same district based upon the same facts and allegations, asserting claims under Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the 1934 Act and Section11 and Section15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The actions were consolidated under the caption In re salesforce.com, inc. Securities Litigation , Case No. C-04-3009 JSW (N.D. Cal.). On December22, 2004, the Court appointed Chuo Zhu as lead plaintiff. On February22, 2005, lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint (the CAC). The CAC alleged violations of Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the 1934 Act, purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased salesforce.com common stock between June23, 2004 and July21, 2004, inclusive. As in the original complaints, the claims in the CAC were based upon allegations that defendants failed to disclose an allegedly declining trend in its revenues and earnings. On April14, 2005, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the CAC. On April15, 2005, the Court granted lead plaintiff leave to file an amended/superseding complaint. On April22, 2005, lead plaintiff filed a Corrected and Superceding [sic] First Amended Class Action Complaint (FAC). As in the CAC, the FAC alleged violations of Section10(b) and Section20(a) of the 1934 Act, purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased salesforce.com common stock between June23, 2004 and July21, 2004, inclusive. The claims in the FAC were based upon allegations that defendants failed to disclose an internal forecast that earnings for fiscal year 2005 would decline from the prior fiscal year. On April29, 2005, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the FAC. On December22, 2005, the court entered an order granting defendants motion to dismiss, with prejudice, and directing the clerk to close the file. On January23, 2006, lead plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration, as well as a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On January27, 2006, defendants filed a motion to strike as untimely lead plaintiffs motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration. On January26, 2006, the Ninth Circuit entered a time schedule order for the appeal, requiring, inter alia , lead plaintiff to file his opening brief on May11, 2006, and defendants to file their responsive brief on June12, 2006. On or about February2, 2006, lead plaintiff filed a motion with the Ninth 75 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) Circuit requesting a stay of appellate proceedings pending the district courts determination of lead plaintiffs motion for leave and defendants motion to strike. Defendants opposed that motion. On February 9, 2006, the Ninth Circuit denied the lead plaintiffs motion for a stay of appellate proceedings, without prejudice to making a motion for limited remand. On March 1, 2006, the district court denied the lead plaintiffs motion for leave and defendants motion to strike on grounds of lack of jurisdiction. Also on March 1, 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a motion with the district court seeking certification to the Ninth Circuit for limited remand. The Company does not believe that the lawsuit has any merit and intends to continue to defend the action and appeal vigorously.
On August6, 2004, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, San Francisco County, entitled Borrelli v. Benioff, et al.
, against the Companys Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and members of its Board of Directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment under state common law. Subsequently, a substantially similar complaint was filed in the same court based on the same facts and allegations, entitled Johnson v. Benioff, et al.
The two actions were consolidated under the caption Borrelli v. Benioff , Case No. CGC-04-433615 (Cal. Super. Ct., S.F. Cty.). On October5, 2004, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint, which is based upon the same facts and circumstances as alleged in the shareholder class action discussed above, and asserts that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by making or failing to prevent salesforce.com, inc. and its management from making statements or omissions that potentially subject the Company to liability and injury to its reputation. The action seeks damages on behalf of salesforce.com in an unspecified amount, among other forms of legal and equitable relief. salesforce.com is named solely as a nominal defendant against which no recovery is sought. The plaintiff shareholders made no demand upon the Board of Directors prior to filing these actions. The deadline for defendants to respond to the consolidated complaint has been extended repeatedly by agreement of the parties, and is now set for June15, 2006. During this time, no discovery or other proceedings have occurred in this case. The derivative action is still in the preliminary stages, and it is not possible for the Company to quantify the extent of potential liability to the individual defendants, if any. Management does not believe that the lawsuits have any merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously.
Additionally, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of its business activities. In managements opinion, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or its financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.
9. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees. Since January1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. The total contributions during the last month of fiscal 2006 were $318,000.
10. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the salesforce.com/foundation, commonly referred to as the Foundation, a non-profit public charity, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are particularly focused on youth and technology. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. He, one of the Companys executive officers and one of the Companys board members hold three of the Foundations nine board seats. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Foundations activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundations statement of activities with its financial results.
Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items totals approximately $30,000 per quarter.
76 Table of Contents salesforce.com, inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued) In addition to the resource sharing with the Foundation, the Company issued the Foundation warrants in August 2002 to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock. Through January31, 2006, the Foundation has exercised 250,000 of these warrants. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The fair value of these donated subscriptions is currently approximately $800,000 per month. The Company plans to continue providing free subscriptions to qualified non-profit organizations.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in periodic SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
(b) Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January31, 2006. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all 78 Table of Contents control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
