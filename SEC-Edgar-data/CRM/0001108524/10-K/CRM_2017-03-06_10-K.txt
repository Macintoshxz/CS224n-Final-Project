PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Salesforce is a leading provider of enterprise software, delivered through the cloud, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings into new areas and industries with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies.
Our service offerings are intuitive and easy to use. They can be deployed rapidly, configured easily and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications, or apps. We deliver our service offerings via major internet browsers and on leading mobile devices. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new apps that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service offerings.
Our Customer Success Platform is a comprehensive portfolio of service offerings providing sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools and our professional cloud services.
Salesforce also believes in giving back. We pioneered, and have inspired other companies to adopt, an integrated philanthropy model called the 1-1-1 model, which leverages 1% of a company's equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. We also believe in equality for all, and have spearheaded initiatives to create a world where equal pay, equal advancement, equal opportunity and equal rights become a reality for our employees and the broader world.
3 Table of Contents We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999. Our principal executive offices are located in SanFrancisco, California, and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com. Our office address is TheLandmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105.
The Age of the Customer At Salesforce, we believe we are living in the single most innovative era in history, as everyone and every thing becomes connected. There are now billions of mobile phones and intelligent connected devices. And behind each and every device, interaction, product and connected community is a customer. Companies have the opportunity to harness all of this information about customers in new and extraordinary ways, enabling them to intelligently connect and engage with customers across every part of the customer experience.
Our Customer Success Platform provides a single view of the customer across all touchpoints. We bring together the power of cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence technologies, enabling our customers to harness data and deliver the connected experiences their customers are increasingly coming to expect.
Our Cloud Service Offerings Our cloud service offerings empower our customers to:  grow their sales faster;  deliver customer service through multiple devices and channels;  create one-to-one customer journeys;  personalize buying experiences across all channels;  build branded communities for customers, partners and employees;  deliver analytics and predictive insights for every business user;  turn data generated by the IoT into meaningful actions;  collaborate on documents, spreadsheets and more to improve productivity, and;  develop modern mobile and desktop apps quickly and easily.
Our cloud service offerings are as follows: Sales Cloud.
The Sales Cloud, which was our first offering and continues to be the largest contributor to total subscription and support revenues, enables companies to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities, gain insights through relationship intelligence and collaborate around any sale on desktop and mobile devices. Ourcustomers use the Sales Cloud to grow their sales pipelines, improve sales productivity, simplify complex business processes and close more deals. The Sales Cloud also offers solutions for partner relationship management, including channel management and partner communities, and the ability to deliver quotes, contracts and invoices to improve forecasting and collect payments faster.
Service Cloud.
The Service Cloud, which is our second largest contributor to total subscription and support revenues, enables companies to deliver smarter, faster and more personalized customer service and support. Our customers use the Service Cloud to connect their service agents with customers anytime and anywhere, on popular devices and across multiple channels  phone, email, chat, live video, SMS, self-service web portals, social networks, online communities and directly within their own products and mobile apps. In addition, Service Cloud also offers a field service solution that enables companies to connect agents, dispatchers and mobile employees through one centralized platform, through which they can schedule and dispatch work intelligently, and track and manage jobs in real-time.
Marketing Cloud.
The Marketing Cloud enables companies to plan, personalize and optimize one-to-one customer interactions across email, mobile, social, web and connected products. In addition, companies can segment and target audiences to power precise digital marketing at scale. With the Marketing Cloud, customer data can also be integrated with the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in the form of leads, contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers.
Commerce Cloud.
The Commerce Cloud empowers brands to deliver a comprehensive digital commerce experience across web, mobile, social and store. It also offers mobile-first point-of-sale and store operations capabilities that increase store personnel effectiveness, connecting the physical and digital commerce experiences.
Community Cloud.
The Community Cloud enables companies to quickly create and manage trusted, branded digital destinations for customers, partners and employees. This allows companies to engage and collaborate directly with groups of people by giving them access to relevant information, apps and experts.
IoT Cloud.
The IoT Cloud enables companies to harness the power behind billions of connected devices, products, sensors and apps to derive entirely new levels of customer insights. With those insights, companies can sell, service and market to their customers in smarter, more personalized ways, and engage proactively with them in real time.
4 Table of Contents Analytics Cloud.
The Analytics Cloud enables any employee across an organization to quickly and easily explore business data, uncover new insights, make smarter decisions and take action from any device. The Analytics Cloud embeds insights related to the context of the business users' roles directly into the workflows and apps they use to make analytics easier and more intuitive, collaborative and actionable.
Salesforce Quip.
Salesforce Quip is a next-generation productivity solution designed for teams with a mobile-first strategy, empowering everyone to collaborate more effectively, work smarter and supercharge their productivity, all without email. Salesforce Quip combines documents, spreadsheets, task lists and team chat in one seamless experience known as a living document.
Salesforce Platform.
The Salesforce Platform (formerly App Cloud) is for building enterprise apps  powering Salesforce's CRM apps, with thousands of partner-built apps and millions of custom apps built by customers.  The Salesforce Platform offers a new continuum of tools, frameworks and services that customers and partners need to build connected apps fast.
Professional Cloud Services We offer professional cloud services including consulting, deployment, training, user-centric design and integration to help customers to achieve business results faster through adoption of Salesforce solutions. We also offer architects and innovation program teams that act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers, providing mission critical support, cloud specialists and pre-packaged accelerators that allow our customers to build on the best practices of our community.
We offer several education service offerings to our customers and partners, ranging from introductory online courses to advanced architecture certifications. With the Trailhead learning platform, our customers and partners have access to free online courses that address topics such as using and administering our services and developing on our platform. For more advanced education, we offer instructor-led and online courses to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings. In addition, we make available a selection of online educational classes at no charge to customers that subscribe to our customer service plans.
Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include: Secure, private, scalable and reliable.
Our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously.
Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership.
Our services can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. We enable customers to achieve up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract.
Ease of integration and configuration.
Information technology (IT) professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solution with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Salesforce Platform (formerly App Cloud) API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our services on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities.
High levels of user adoption.
We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users have a more familiar user experience than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. We have also designed our solutions to be used on popular mobile devices, making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones.
Rapid development of apps and increased innovation.
Our customers and third-party developers can create apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily configure our applications to suit their specific needs, and also support a variety of programming languages so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them via multiple mobile devices. By 5 Table of Contents providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware. Developers with ideas for a new app can create, test and support their solutions on the Salesforce Platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to customers.
Continuous innovation.
We release hundreds of new features to all of our customers three times a year. Our metadata-driven, global multi-tenant cloud runs on a single code base, which enables every customer to run their business on the latest release without disruption. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefits all of our customers immediately.
Positive environmental impact.
Our multi-tenant cloud computing model has a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional IT hardware and software.When organizations move business applications to Salesforce, they can significantly reduce their energy use and carbon footprint compared to traditional on-premises solutions.
Our Strategy Key elements of our strategy include: Extending existing service offerings.
We offer multiple editions of our service offerings at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to extend all editions of our solutions with new features, functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships. Over the last year, for example, we have invested heavily in artificial intelligence capabilities to create Salesforce Einstein, which will allow users of our products to deliver more predictive customer experiences.
Cross selling and upselling.
We see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our services, we aim to upgrade the customer to premium editions and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units, ultimately becoming our customers' trusted advisors, inspiring enterprise-wide transformation and accelerating strategic engagements through direct engagement with the highest levels of our customers' executive management.
Expanding into new horizontal markets.
As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, commerce and IoT. We drive innovation both organically and through acquisitions, such as our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware, a digital commerce leader.
Targeting vertical markets.
In order to meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, we also provide solutions specifically built for certain vertical industries, such as financial services, healthcare and government.
Extending go-to-market capabilities.
We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our solutions around the globe.
Reducing customer attrition.
Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers.
Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms.
The Salesforce Platform enables existing customers, independent software vendors (ISVs) and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud-based apps. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our online marketplace for business apps, or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and future customers.
In addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above, from time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights.  This evaluation resulted in our acquisition in fiscal 2017 of several companies, such as:  SteelBrick, Inc., which provides us with apps to automate the quote-to-cash process,  MetaMind, Inc., which allows us to extend our intelligence in natural language processing and image recognition across our clouds,  BeyondCore, Inc., which provides us with smart data discovery technology that automatically explores millions of variable combinations from structured data sources,  Demandware, Inc., which allows us to expand our position in CRM and pursue the digital commerce market,  Quip, Inc., which provides us with a next generation productivity solution, and  Krux Digital, Inc., which provides us with a data management platform.
6 Table of Contents Prior to this acquisition activity, our most significant acquisition was ExactTarget, Inc. in fiscal 2014.
Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable, cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture.
Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. Customers can use and customize an application as though they each have a separate instance, and their data and customizations remain secure and insulated from the activities of all other tenants. Our multi-tenant services run on a single stack of hardware and software, which is comprised of commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Multi-tenancy also allows for faster bug and security fixes, automatic software updates and the ability to deploy major releases and frequent, incremental improvements to our services, benefiting the entire user community.
Our services are optimized to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than on-premise software that must be written to the different hardware, operating systems and database platforms existing within a customers unique systems environment. Our developers build and support solutions and features on a single code base on our chosen technology platform.
Our efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features, functionality and services. From time to time, we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire companies or technologies, and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our solutions. Performance, functional depth, security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction.
Our customers access our services over the Internet via all of the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems.
We provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure operated by us but secured within third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. These third-party data center providers provide space, physical security, continuous power and cooling. The remainder of our services operate from cloud computing platform providers who offer Infrastructure as a Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking.
Sources of Revenue All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major core cloud service offerings:  Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Salesforce Platform and Other, and Marketing Cloud. Our subscription and support revenues are disaggregated into these four core offerings. For a more detailed discussion, see the Revenue by Cloud Service Offering discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis.
We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service. We also derive revenues from premier support, which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee.
We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. We enter into professional services contracts that are on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We recognize revenue as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services.
Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual installments.
Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing, size and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding 7 Table of Contents effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter.
Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, such as the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 26 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas.
Direct Sales We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads.
Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects.
This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer.
We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service.
Strategic Investments Since 2009, we have been investing in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. Our minority investments in over 180 companies as of January31, 2017 also help us stay connected with the pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry. In some cases, we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested.
Because of the inherent risk in investing in early-to-late stage technology companies, our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital.
Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities on the cities and countries with the largest market opportunity.
Our primary marketing activities include:  Multi-channel marketing campaigns that span email, social, web and more that align to a broader customer journey;  Proprietary events of all sizes, ranging from Dreamforce to salon dinners, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness;  Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition;  Content marketing and engagement on all of the major social channels;  Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties;  Partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners;  Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, case studies, white papers and marketing collateral;  Customer testimonials;  Tools that enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers; and 8 Table of Contents  Event sponsorships and primary real estate signage.
Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and system administration. In addition, we offer a mission critical support add-on that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise architecture, and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products.
Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis.
Competition The market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.
We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration, e-commerce and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps. We may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors, as well as start-up and midsized companies focused on disruption, who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include:  On-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors;  Cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation;  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality;  Traditional platform development environment companies;  Cloud computing development platform companies;  Internally developed applications (by our potential customers IT departments);  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies;  E-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; and  Artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies.
We believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they may become a greater competitive threat.
Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services.At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.
9 Table of Contents Employees As of January31, 2017 , we had more than 25,000 employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union, however, for certain foreign subsidiaries, workers councils represent our employees.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our data or our IT systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.
Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.
Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.
10 Table of Contents Interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.
We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. Any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. We have from time to time experiencedinterruptionsin our services andsuchinterruptionsmay occurin thefuture. Interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.
As part of our current disaster recoveryand business continuityarrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data are currently replicated in near real-time in aseparatefacility locatedelsewhere. Companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.
These hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services.
If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. When we add data centers and add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.
Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties.
The Internets infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design.  This infrastructure is run by a series of independent third party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), now under the stewardship of ICANN.
The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage or result in fragmentation of the Internet, resulting in multiple separate Internets. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our Internet-based services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.
Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.
Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. In some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions Data Protection Directive, and the country-specificlaws andregulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information.Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Unions e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive.Such laws and regulations are subject tonew anddiffering interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions.These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our 11 Table of Contents customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally.For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. While other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain, the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.
Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.
Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Further, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results.
In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.
The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.
The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration, e-commerce and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include:  On-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors;  Cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation;  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality;  Traditional platform development environment companies; 12 Table of Contents  Cloud computing development platform companies;  Internally developed applications (by our potential customers IT departments);  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies;  E-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; and  Artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies.
Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.
As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.
As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;  difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;  the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;  inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;  difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis;  augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation;  increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services;  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;  unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology;  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation;  additional stock based compensation; the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue;  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;  ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations;  challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages and cultures;  currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and  the tax effects of any such acquisitions.
Any of these risks could harm our business. In addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be 13 Table of Contents diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock.
We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. Other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results.
We invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments.Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment.The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. Further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital.
Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially.
Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.
Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements;  the attrition rates for our services;  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;  changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements;  the seasonality of our customers businesses, especially Commerce Cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the British Pound;  variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings;  the number of new employees;  changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition;  the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services;  the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses;  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;  the length of the sales cycle for our services;  new product and service introductions by our competitors;  our success in selling our services to large enterprises;  evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations;  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services;  expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion;  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; 14 Table of Contents  conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio;  income tax effects;  our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments;  other than temporary impairments in the value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter;  expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur;  general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates;  timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services;  regulatory compliance costs;  changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;  the impact of new accounting pronouncements, for example, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), the new revenue recognition standard;  equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders;  the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules;  the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and  the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards.
Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that historical quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
Additionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs.
If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed.
Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.
We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The markets for our Analytics, Community, IoT, Commerce and Salesforce Quip Clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in 15 Table of Contents significant revenue for us. Commerce Cloud originated as part of our Demandware acquisition and Salesforce Quip originated from our acquisition of Quip. Further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our conversion to our new Lightning platform, and introduction of new services beyond the CRM market, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate.
Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.
Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed.
Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations.
We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. Historically, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together have represented less than 30percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States, as well as international operations generally, include:  localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;  laws and business practices favoring local competitors;  pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;  liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations;  foreign currency fluctuations and controls;  compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers;  regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders;  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;  different pricing environments;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property;  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties;  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches;  tax policies addressing multinational operations; and  regional economic and political conditions.
Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed.
16 Table of Contents Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. Dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business.
Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions.
Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer.
If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed.
Our success depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our services. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies.
We conduct our business in the following locations: United States, Europe, Canada, Asia, South America and Australia. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in British Pound Sterling, the Euro and Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change.The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. Recent events, including the United Kingdoms 2016 vote in favor of exiting the European Union, or Brexit, and similar geopolitical developments and uncertainty in the European Union and elsewhere could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations and related risks for our business.
17 Table of Contents Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.
We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term.
We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted.
Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan.
As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.
As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.
Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business.
For large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.
We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.
We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters.
The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.
18 Table of Contents In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights.  Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter.
In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property.
We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.
Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.
We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. In addition, positions the Company takes on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.
Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management 19 Table of Contents team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.
In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, or Aloha spirit, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. As our organization grows, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.
Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.
Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.
Periodicchangesto our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.
Weperiodicallychangeand make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, managementchanges, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Any such future sales organizationchangesmay result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. In addition, any significantchangeto the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth.
Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions.
We are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
Our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and Australia, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions. Additionally, in October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development released final guidance covering various topics, including transfer pricing, country-by-country reporting and definitional changes to permanent establishment which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities.
We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.
20 Table of Contents Our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations.
We have a high level of debt, including the 0.25% convertible senior notes we issued in March 2013 (the 0.25% Senior Notes) due April1, 2018, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont) and capital lease arrangements. Additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. In July 2016, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. Also in July 2016, we entered into the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of Demandware. Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;  cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments;  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and  due to limitations within the revolving credit facility covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement.
Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.
A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.
New lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. The implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet.
Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, recent geopolitical developments, including Brexit, have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets; the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.
21 Table of Contents Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.
Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results.
We regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition, the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and lease accounting, to alter our operational policies so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or to restate our published financial statements. Such changes may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results.
We may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations.
Our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.
We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.
Our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the Commerce Departments Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with these U.S. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, the U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. Any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.
The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include:  variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;  variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business;  forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; 22 Table of Contents  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;  announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;  announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;  recruitment or departure of key personnel;  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;  the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;  trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock;  the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and  issuance of debt or other convertible securities.
In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources.
We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.
We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock.
We may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock.
There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. If we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on the notes, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business.
The fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.
The fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.
23 Table of Contents The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock.
We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions.
The hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.
We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control.
We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.
The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties.
Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;  provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock;  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill);  prohibit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.
In addition, Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.
24 Table of Contents In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.
ITEM1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM2.PROPERTIES As of January31, 2017 , our executive and principal offices for sales, marketing, professional services and development consist of over 1.9 million square feet of leased and owned property in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of this total, we lease and occupy approximately 1.3 million square feet and own and occupy a majority of the approximately 820,000 square feet of total owned space at 50 Fremont Street. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space in a number of countries in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia for our international operations, primarily for local sales and professional services personnel.
In addition, in April 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 733,000 rentable square feet of under construction office space located in San Francisco, California. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not currently occupy this property, and we have excluded this square footage from the total leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area stated above.
We operate data centers in the U.S.,Europe and Asia pursuant to various co-location lease arrangements.
We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms.
ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.
We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results.
We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter.

As of January31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Consolidated Balance Sheet Data: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (4) $ 2,208,887 $ 2,725,377 $ 1,890,284 $ 1,321,017 $ 1,758,285 (Negative) working capital (5) (1,261,526 ) 114,318 19,296 (866,972 ) (8,770 ) Total assets (6) 17,584,923 12,762,920 10,654,053 9,096,124 5,516,200 Long-term obligations excluding deferred revenue (6)(7) 2,789,330 2,119,160 2,254,086 2,002,311 172,607 Accumulated deficit (464,910 ) (653,271 ) (605,845 ) (343,157 ) (110,982 ) Total stockholders equity 7,500,127 5,002,869 3,975,183 3,038,510 2,317,633 (4) Excludes the restricted cash balance of $115.0 million as of January 31, 2015.
(5) The Company considers all its marketable debt securities to be available to support current liquidity needs including those with maturity dates beyondone year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For consistency in presentation, working capital in the table above as of January 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013 includes amounts previously in Marketable securities, noncurrent.
(6) In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03), which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability rather than as an asset. However, ASU 2015-03 does not address deferred issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements; therefore, in August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (ASU 2015-15). ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, including arrangements with no outstanding borrowings, and classify them as an asset, and amortize them over the term of the arrangements. We adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified all of our unamortized debt issuance costs previously reported in other assets, net to net against the respective debt liability balances. As a result of the reclassifications, total assets, working capital, long-term obligations excluding deferred revenue in the table above as of January 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were reclassified out of assets and netted against the long-term obligations.
(7) Long-term obligations primarily excludes deferred revenue, noncurrent and includes the term loan entered into in July 2016 for $500.0 million , loan assumed on 50 Fremont, the 0.75% convertible senior notes issued in January 2010, the 0.25% convertible senior notes issued in March 2013, the term loan entered into in July 2013 which was subsequently paid off in fiscal 2016, and the revolving credit facility entered into in October 2014 and amended July 2016. At January 31, 2015, the 0.75% notes had matured and were no longer outstanding. At January31, 2014 and 2013, the 0.75% notes were convertible and accordingly were classified as a current liability.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.
Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities.
Our core mission is to help our customers transform by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things (IoT) integration and collaborative productivity tools - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include:  extend existing service offerings;  cross sell and upsell;  expand into new horizontal markets;  target vertical markets and industries;  extend go-to-market capabilities;  reduce customer attrition; and  encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms.
In addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. This evaluation resulted in a significant increase in our acquisition activity during fiscal 2017.
We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates.
To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the introduction of our Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, and IoT Cloud, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as Commerce Cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and Salesforce Quip, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform (formerly App Cloud) core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.
32 Table of Contents We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware, Inc. (Demandware), a digital commerce leader. We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2017 and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2018.
Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing and Commerce Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended January31, 2017 , which is comparable to the eight and nine percent attrition rate during the same period a year ago. While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.
We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 47 percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January31, 2017 and 49 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness.
In July 2016 we acquired Demandware, an industry-leading provider of enterprise cloud commerce solutions in the digital commerce market. We acquired Demandware to expand our position in customer relationship management and to pursue the digital commerce market segment with the new Salesforce Commerce Cloud. The financial results of Demandware are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Demandware was approximately $2.9 billion .
In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement) which provides for a $500.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) that matures on July11, 2019. All amounts borrowed under the Term Loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for Demandware. Additionally, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and certain other institutional lenders that increased our existing revolving credit facility dated October 2014 to$1.0 billion. As of January31, 2017 , there was $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
In August 2016, we acquired the outstanding stock of Quip, Inc. (Quip). Quip combines content and communication to create living documents to allow work-teams to write, edit and discuss documents, spreadsheets and checklists in a single experience. The total purchase price for Quip was approximately $412.0 million .
In November 2016, we acquired the outstanding stock of Krux Digital, Inc. (Krux). Krux is a leading data management platform that unifies, segments and activates audiences to increase engagement with users, prospects and customers. The total purchase price for Krux was approximately $741.8 million .
Prior to these and other acquisitions during fiscal 2017, our most significant acquisition was ExactTarget, Inc in fiscal 2014.
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January31. References to fiscal 2017 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January31, 2017 .
Operating Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, including fiscal 2017, we have completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because 33 Table of Contents the majority of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2)related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 92 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2017 . Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.
Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.
In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesRevenue Recognition below.
Revenue by Cloud Service Offering The information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings.
All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major core cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 Variance- Percent FY'17 and FY'16 Variance- Percent FY'16 and FY'15 Sales Cloud $ 3,060.6 $ 2,699.0 $ 2,443.0 13 % 10 % Service Cloud 2,320.7 1,817.8 1,320.2 28 % 38 % Salesforce Platform and Other 1,441.6 1,034.7 745.3 39 % 39 % Marketing Cloud 933.3 654.1 505.3 43 % 29 % Total $ 7,756.2 $ 6,205.6 $ 5,013.8 Subscription and support revenues from the Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, IoT Cloud, Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Quip were not significant. Analytics Cloud, IoT Cloud and Salesforce Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above. Community Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased. Commerce Cloud revenue, 34 Table of Contents resulting from our Demandware acquisition in July 2016, is included in Marketing Cloud. As required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), we recorded deferred revenue related to acquired contracts from Demandware at fair value. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that Demandware would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $933.3 million subscription and support revenue for Marketing Cloud for the fiscal year 2017, approximately 11 percent was attributed to our Demandware acquisition. To the extent Demandware contracts are renewed following the acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the respective contractual periods.
In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customers estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 13 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2017 and 10 percent for fiscal 2016 , based on customers estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above.
Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions.  For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customers actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customers current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customers business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful.
Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement.
The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time.While we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. Accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter.
Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2017 , which is consistent with fiscal 2016 . Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.
35 Table of Contents The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): January31, 2017 October31, 2016 July31, 2016 April30, 2016 Fiscal 2017 Accounts receivable, net $ 3,196,643 $ 1,281,425 $ 1,323,114 $ 1,192,965 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 5,542,802 3,495,133 3,823,561 4,006,914 Operating cash flow (1) 706,146 154,312 250,678 1,051,062 Unbilled deferred revenue (2) 9.0 bn 8.6 bn 8.0 bn 7.6 bn January31, 2016 October31, 2015 July31, 2015 April30, 2015 Fiscal 2016 Accounts receivable, net $ 2,496,165 $ 1,060,726 $ 1,067,799 $ 926,381 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 4,291,553 2,846,510 3,034,991 3,056,820 Operating cash flow (1) 470,208 162,514 304,278 735,081 Unbilled deferred revenue (2) 7.1 bn 6.7 bn 6.2 bn 6.0 bn January31, 2015 October31, 2014 July31, 2014 April30, 2014 Fiscal 2015 Accounts receivable, net $ 1,905,506 $ 794,590 $ 834,323 $ 684,155 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 3,321,449 2,223,977 2,352,904 2,324,615 Operating cash flow (1) 336,506 123,732 239,078 482,128 Unbilled deferred revenue (2) 5.7 bn 5.4 bn 5.0 bn 4.8 bn (1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which addresses among other items, updates to the presentation and treatment of excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation on the Statements of Cash Flows. We have adopted changes to the statement of cash flows on a retrospective basis and have accordingly updated the operating cash flow amounts presented above.
(2) Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue.
36 Table of Contents Unbilled Deferred Revenue, an Operational Measure The U.S. GAAP deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is an operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue amounts by quarter are reflected in the table above. Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. Unbilled deferred revenue also does not include any estimates for overage billings above a customer's minimum commitment.
Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues.
Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third party fees and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.
We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.
Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.
We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies.
Marketing and Sales.
Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.
37 Table of Contents We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost.
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. However, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses.
Stock-Based Expenses.
Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.
During fiscal 2017 , we recognized stock-based expense of $820.4 million . As of January31, 2017 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $2.6 billion . We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $980.5 million during fiscal 2018 ; $762.9 million during fiscal 2019 ; $540.5 million during fiscal 2020 ; $249.7 million during fiscal 2021 ; $17.4 million during fiscal 2022 ; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023 ; $8.0 million during fiscal 2024 . The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January31, 2017 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods.
Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more companies.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2)related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees.
We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  the service has been or is being provided to the customer;  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
38 Table of Contents Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Professional Services and Other Revenues Our professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed-fee or subscription basis. As discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed.
Multiple Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.
Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.
For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price.
We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.
Deferred Revenue.
The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.
Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
Deferred Commissions.
We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.
39 Table of Contents During fiscal 2017 , we deferred $462.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $371.5 million to sales expense. During fiscal 2016 , we deferred $380.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $319.1 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $539.6 million at January31, 2017 and $449.1 million at January31, 2016 .
Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs . We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (ASC 350),Intangibles- Goodwill and Otherin accounting forthe cost of computer software developed for internal-useand the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard.
Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Stock-Based Expense.
We recognize stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months .
Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years.
We, at times, grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, and as a result, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. We recognize stock-based expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards.
Business Combinations.
Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:  future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;  the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings;  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and  discount rates.
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
In the event that we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations.
Goodwill and Intangibles.
We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected 40 Table of Contents attrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
Income Taxes.
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
Strategic Investments.
We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (ASC 323), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the equity method of accounting for such investments.
We determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investees financial metrics, the investees products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investees liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.
If the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment.

Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. The January31, 2017 balance includes approximately $450.0 million related to Demandware, which we acquired in July 2016.
Fiscal Years Ended January31, 2017 and 2016 Revenues.

Subscription and support revenues were $7.8 billion , or 92 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $6.2 billion , or 93 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.6 billion , or 25 percent . The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2017 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Revenue resulting from our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware contributed $120.4 million to total revenues for fiscal 2017 . Revenues from other acquired businesses in fiscal 2017 were not material. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Our attrition rate also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. Changes in our pricing have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $635.8 million , or eight percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $461.6 million , or seven percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $174.2 million , or 38 percent . The increase is primarily due to the growth in our subscription professional services.

The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2017 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $103.8 million compared to fiscal 2016.
Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent , 95 percent and 94 percent for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
Cost of Revenues.
Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance Dollars (in thousands) 2017 2016 Subscription and support $ 1,556,353 $ 1,188,967 $ 367,386 Professional services and other 677,686 465,581 212,105 Total cost of revenues $ 2,234,039 $ 1,654,548 $ 579,491 Percent of total revenues 27 % 25 % Cost of revenues was $2.2 billion , or 27 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $1.7 billion , or 25 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $579.5 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $240.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $38.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $162.4 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $23.5 million in professional and outside services, an increase of amortization of purchased intangibles of $46.8 million , an increase in depreciation of equipment of $16.2 million and an increase in allocated overhead of $35.9 million . We have increased our headcount by 34 percent since January31, 2016 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods.
The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 by $41.9 million and $4.0 million , respectively. The increase is primarily due to the growth in our headcount as well as the increase in employee costs for our subscription professional services employees. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $173.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $58.1 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $28.1 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 35 percent since January31, 2016 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.
Marketing and sales expenses were $3.9 billion , or 47 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $3.2 billion , or 49 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $678.2 million .

General and administrative expenses were $967.6 million , or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $748.2 million , or 11 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $219.3 million . The increase was primarily due to an increase of $175.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.9 million in stock-based expense and an increase in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 22 percent since January31, 2016 as we added personnel to support our growth.
In connection with the purchase of 50 Fremont, we recognized a net non-cash gain in fiscal 2016 totaling approximately $36.6 million on the termination of the lease signed in January 2012.
Other income and expense.
Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance Dollars (in thousands) 2017 2016 Investment income $ 27,374 $ 15,341 $ 12,033 Interest expense (88,988 ) (72,485 ) (16,503 ) Other income (expense) 9,072 (15,292 ) 24,364 Gain on sales of land and building improvements 0 21,792 (21,792 ) Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments 13,697 0 13,697 Investment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $27.4 million for fiscal 2017 and was $15.3 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was due to both realized gains resulting from the sales of marketable securities as well as higher interest income across our portfolio.
Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 Mission, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of Demandware. Interest expense was $89.0 million for fiscal 2017 and was $72.5 million 45 Table of Contents during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the term loan in fiscal 2017 associated with the Demandware purchase and our outstanding balance in our revolving facility in in fiscal 2017.
Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as strategic investments fair market value adjustments, gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions.
Gain on sales of land and building improvements consists of the gain the company recognized from sales of undeveloped real estate and a portion of associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California. Gain on sales of land and building improvements, net of closing costs, was $21.8 million during fiscal 2016.
Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments represents gains on sales of strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment. The difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations.
Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.
Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance Dollars (in thousands) 2017 2016 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ 154,249 $ (111,705 ) $ 265,954 Effective tax rate (608 )% 174 % We reported a tax benefit of $154.2 million on a pretax income of $25.4 million , which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 608 percent for fiscal 2017 . The most significant component of this tax amount was the tax benefit of $210.3 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of our tax valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. Additionally, as a result of early adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09) and our valuation allowance position, we did not record significant U.S. current income tax expense.
We recorded a tax provision of $111.7 million with a pretax income of $64.3 million , which resulted in an effective tax rate of 174 percent for fiscal 2016 . We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock.
We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. We will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years, for example, if the trend in increasing taxable income continues. Our valuation allowance could contribute to the volatility of our effective tax rate and is difficult to forecast in future periods.

The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our attrition rate, which was favorable compared to the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month were not a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $461.6 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, compared to $359.8 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $101.8 million, or 28 percent.

The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2016 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $170.5 million compared to fiscal 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At January31, 2017 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion and accounts receivable of $3.2 billion .
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.7 billion during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion during fiscal 2016and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of netincomeadjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; amortization of debt discount; discrete items such as the non-cash gain from the termination of the 50 Fremont lease; the expense associated with stock-based awards; gains on sales of strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by payments made during fiscal 2017 for the transaction fees related to the acquisitions we completed during the year.
Our working capital accounts consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, deferred commissions, prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. Our working capital in some quarters, may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across quarters.
As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.
We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.
49 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.5 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of Demandware in July 2016, purchases of marketable securities of approximately $1.1 billion , new office build-outsand strategic and capital investments, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.0 billion . Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal2016and $698.4 million during fiscal 2015. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal2016primarily related to capital expenditures, strategic investments, business combinations, purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from sales of Mission Bay land and the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $997.7 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $73.2 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of $748.8 million proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $495.6 million of proceeds from the Term Loan, net of loan fees, $401.5 million from proceeds from equity plans and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from operating activities due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 offset by $98.2 million of principal payments on capital leases and $550.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was$73.2 millionduring fiscal2016as compared to net cash used in financing activities of$318.2 millionduring fiscal 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal2016consisted primarily of$455.5 millionfrom proceeds from equity plan offset by$82.3 millionof principal payments on capital leases and$300.0 million paymentof our revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2015, we repaid the convertible senior notes that matured.
In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes), due April 1, 2018, unless earlier purchased by us or converted. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January31, 2017 . Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January31, 2017 . Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes were not convertible at the holders option.
In July 2016, in order to partially finance the acquisition of Demandware, we entered into a$500.0 millionterm loan (the Term Loan) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict us and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions and repurchase stock. We are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Term Loan Credit Agreement includes customary events of default. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the applicable interest rate for any overdue principal and 2.00% above the rate applicable for base rate loans for any other overdue amounts. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Term Loan Credit Agreements covenants as of January31, 2017 .
In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement), which provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of theRevolving Loan Credit Agreement. As of January31, 2017 , we had $200.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Subsequent to January31, 2017 , we paid the remaining outstanding balance of the Credit Facility.
TheRevolving Loan Credit Agreementcontains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in theRevolving Loan Credit Agreement.We were in compliance with theRevolving Loan Credit Agreements covenants as of January31, 2017 .
50 Table of Contents In February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 820,000rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont). At the time of the acquisition, we were leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of the available space in 50 Fremont. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was$637.6 million. In financing the purchase price, we used$115.0 millionof restricted cash on hand and assumed a$200.0 millionloan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash.
In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years.The agreement provides that we will pay$96.0 millionin fiscal 2018,$108.0 millionin fiscal 2019 and$126.0 millionin fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2017, we paid $70.0 million.
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S.treasury securities, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.
As of January31, 2017 , we have a total of $83.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.
We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January31, 2017 , the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Capital lease obligations, including interest $ 436,747 $ 119,342 $ 317,369 $ 36 $ 0 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 2,536,933 257,387 569,210 507,519 1,202,817 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 382,215 205,863 176,352 0 0 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 1,154,313 2,875 1,151,438 0 0 Loan assumed on 50 Fremont 200,000 0 0 0 200,000 Term loan 500,000 0 500,000 0 0 Revolving Credit Facility 200,000 0 0 200,000 0 Financing obligation - leased facility 322,340 21,437 44,206 45,984 210,713 Contractual commitments 365,200 122,660 239,558 2,982 0 $ 6,097,748 $ 729,564 $ 2,998,133 $ 756,521 $ 1,613,530 The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.
The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January31, 2017 , $220.3 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and the non-current portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
51 Table of Contents In April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 732,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases.
In February 2016, we entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space in New York, New York. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately$288.0 millionover the approximately12year term of the agreement, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. In May 2016, we entered into an agreement to lease additional office space in Indianapolis, Indiana. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately$77.0 millionover the approximately13year term of the agreement, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018.
During fiscal 2017 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.
In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock.
We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12months.

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia, South America and Australia. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (USD). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
Our European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound are first converted into the British Pound and then British Pounds are translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, revenues in France are translated from the Euro to the British Pound and then into the USD. Our Statement of Operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies, deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies.
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer trade accounts, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative.
52 Table of Contents We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (ASC 815),Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors.
Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expense and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were lower relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate.
Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion at January31, 2017 . This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.
An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January31, 2017 could result in a $13.0 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.
At January31, 2016 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion . The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $20.9 million .
Market Risk and Market Interest Risk We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions.
In March 2013, we issued the 0.25% Senior Notes due April 1, 2018. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 0.25% Senior Notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the 0.25% Senior Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 0.25% Senior Notes.
The 0.25% Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 0.25% Senior Notes. However, the value of the 0.25% Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate 0.25% Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.15 billion as of January31, 2017 . The total estimated fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes at January31, 2017 53 Table of Contents was $1.5 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , which was $126.52.
In July 2016, we amended our credit agreement (the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement) to provide for a$1.0 billionunsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021.
The borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of0.00% to 0.75%or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate of0.125% to 0.25%, with such rate being based on the our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January31, 2017 , there was a $200.0 million outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.9% for fiscal 2017 . Subsequent to January31, 2017 , we paid the remaining balance of the Credit Facility.
In February 2015, we assumed a$200.0 millionloan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (the Loan). The Loan bears an interest rate of3.75%per annum and is due in June 2023. The Loan requires interest only payments with the remaining principal due at maturity. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of January31, 2017 .
In July 2016, we entered into a$500.0 millionterm loan (the Term Loan) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. We entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of Demandware. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. The Term Loan is payable in July 2019, with the outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity.
By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR.The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.8 %as of January31, 2017 . Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.
The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty.However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.
Our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 180 privately held companies, primarily comprised of ISVs and system integrators. We invest in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $70.0 million , with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of $10 million. As of January31, 2017 and January31, 2016 the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $526.0 million and $504.5 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $758.3 million and $714.1 million as of January31, 2017 and January31, 2016 , respectively. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital.

We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Salesforce.com, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Demandware, Inc., which is included in the January 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements of salesforce.com, inc. and constituted two percent of both consolidated total and net assets as of January 31, 2017, and one percent of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of salesforce.com, inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Demandware, Inc.
In our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. The Company introduced its first CRM solution in February 2000, and has since expanded its service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities.
Our core mission is to help our customers transform by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things (IoT) integration and collaborative productivity tools - provide the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January31. References to fiscal 2017, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January31, 2017 .
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:  the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements,  the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations,  the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes,  the fair value of certain stock awards issued,  the useful lives of intangible assets, property and equipment and building and structural components, and  the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, including fiscal 2017, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the majority of the Company's offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
65 Table of Contents Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. In addition, in connection with the Company's 0.25% Senior Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock which are exposed to concentrations of credit risk.  Collateral is not required for accounts receivable or the note hedge transactions. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. Receivables are written-off and charged against its recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.
No single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January31, 2017 and 2016 .
No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
Geographic Locations As of January31, 2017 and 2016 , assets located outside the Americas were 12 percent and 11 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January31, 2017 and 2016 , assets located in the United States were 86 percent and 87 percent of total assets, respectively.
Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 Americas $ 6,224,971 $ 4,910,745 $ 3,868,329 Europe 1,373,547 1,162,808 984,919 Asia Pacific 793,466 593,663 520,338 $ 8,391,984 $ 6,667,216 $ 5,373,586 Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent , 95 percent and 94 percent in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2)related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees.
The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  the service has been or is being provided to the customer;  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers.
Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
66 Table of Contents Professional Services and Other Revenues The Companys professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed fee basis or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed.
Multiple Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.
Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.
For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of these deliverables have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price for its subscription services.
The Company determines BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.
Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.
Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force.
The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months . The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts.
67 Table of Contents The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.
Marketable Securities Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income.
Strategic Investments The Company holds certain marketable and non-marketable equity securities which are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and the non-marketable equity securities are recorded at cost. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting and classified as strategic investments on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the cost method of accounting, the non-marketable securities are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary impairments, certain distributions and additional investments.
Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value.
The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 2 Investments.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: Computers, equipment and software 3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years Building and structural components Average weighted useful life of 32 years Building- leased facility 27 years Building improvements 10 years When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.
Capitalized Software The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, 68 Table of Contents which is generally three to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Intangible Assets acquired through Business Combinations Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
Impairment Assessment The Company evaluates intangible assets and long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.
There was no impairment of intangible assets, long-lived assets or goodwill during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations.
In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations.
Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. In certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement.
The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.
In the event the Company is the deemed owner for accounting purposes during construction, the Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease.
The Company additionally has entered into subleases for unoccupied leased office space. To the extent there are losses associated with the sublease, they are recognized in the period the sublease is executed. Gains are recognized over the sublease term. Any sublease payments received in excess of the straight-line rent payments for the sublease are recorded in other income (expense).
69 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock-Based Expense The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months .
Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years .
The Company, at times, grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash considerations. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, therefore the Company has accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards.
Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $350.3 million , $315.6 million and $203.6 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income (loss) for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates.
70 Table of Contents Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances.
The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.
New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2017 In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03), which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability rather than an asset that is amortized. However, ASU 2015-03 does not address deferred issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements; therefore, in August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (ASU 2015-15). ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, including arrangements with no outstanding borrowings, and classify them as an asset, and amortize them over the term of the arrangements. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by the standards.These standards are adopted on a retrospective basis in the period of adoption.  The Company adopted the standards in fiscal 2017. Upon adoption, the unamortized debt issuance costs previously reported in Other assets, net, with a carrying amount of approximately $7.9 million at January 31, 2016, were reclassified and presented as a deduction of the corresponding liabilities, Convertible 0.25% senior notes, net, Term Loan, and Loan assumed on 50 Fremont.
In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805) (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The Company adopted this standard during the three months ended April 30, 2016 and there was no material impact of this on the Company's financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which simplifies and improves several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for public entities. The new guidance requires companies to record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled, and eliminates the requirement to reclassify cash flows related to excess tax benefits from operating activities to financing activities on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted the standard in the three months ended April 30, 2016. Upon adoption, the Company recognized the previously unrecognized excess tax benefits using the modified retrospective transition method, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment of $8.7 million to accumulated deficit. This adjustment reduced the accumulated deficit balance for fiscal 2017. The previously unrecognized excess tax effects were recorded as a deferred tax asset, which was almost fully offset by a valuation allowance. Without the valuation allowance, the Companys deferred tax assets would have increased by $614.5 million . The Company also elected to apply the change in presentation to the statements of cash flows retrospectively and no longer classified the excess tax benefits from employee stock plans as a reduction from operating cash flows for all periods presented.As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2016 and 2015 were adjusted as follows: $59.5 million and $7.7 million increases to net cash provided by operating activities, respectively, and $59.5 million and $7.7 million decrease to net cash used in financing activities, respectively.
71 Table of Contents Pending Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. ASU 2014-09, as amended, will be effective for the beginning of fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period.
The Company currently anticipates adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented. The Company's ability to adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent upon system readiness for both revenue and commissions and the completion of the analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.
The Company is continuing to assess the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures and has not yet determined whether the effect will be material. Additionally, as the Company continues to assess the new standard along with industry trends and additional interpretive guidance, the Company may adjust its implementation plan accordingly.
The Company believes that the new standard will impact the following policies and disclosures:  The removal of the current limitation on contingent revenue may result in revenue being recognized earlier for certain contracts;  Allocation of revenue across different clouds and professional services;  Estimation of variable consideration for arrangements with overage fees;  Required disclosures including information about the remaining transaction price and when the Company expects to recognize revenue; and  Accounting for deferred commissions including costs that qualify for deferral and the amortization period.
The commission accounting under the new standard is significantly different than the Company's current capitalization policy. The new standard will result in additional types of costs that will be capitalized.  Additionally, all amounts capitalized will be amortized over a period longer than the Company's current policy of amortizing the deferred amounts over the specific revenue contract terms.
InJanuary2016,theFASBissuedAccountingStandardsUpdateNo.2016-01,FinancialInstrument-Overall (Subtopic 825-10) (ASU 2016-01), which requires entities to measure equity instruments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. However, for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the existing practical expedient, the investments will be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01, including the impact to its marketable securities and strategic investments. The adoption could have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects its leases designated as operating leases in Note 13, Commitments, will be reported on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements as it relates to other aspects of the business.
In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year. The Company plans to adopt the new standard in its first quarter of fiscal 2019 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
72 Table of Contents Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to fiscal 2016 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation in the Balance Sheet. These reclassifications include short-term marketable securities, marketable securities, noncurrent capitalized software, net, intangible assets acquired from business combinations, net and other assets, net.
2. Investments Marketable Securities The Company considers all its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations,including those with maturity dates beyondone year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis.
At January31, 2017 , marketable securities consisted of the following (in thousands): Investments classified as Marketable Securities Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Corporate notes and obligations $ 321,284 $ 887 $ (1,531 ) $ 320,640 U.S. treasury securities 62,429 68 (674 ) 61,823 Mortgage backed obligations 74,882 39 (669 ) 74,252 Asset backed securities 101,913 74 (197 ) 101,790 Municipal securities 33,523 35 (183 ) 33,375 Foreign government obligations 10,491 3 (36 ) 10,458 Total marketable securities $ 604,522 $ 1,106 $ (3,290 ) $ 602,338 At January31, 2016 , marketable securities consisted of the following (in thousands): Investments classified as Marketable Securities Amortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Corporate notes and obligations $ 949,266 $ 1,398 $ (2,983 ) $ 947,681 U.S. treasury securities 157,625 375 (56 ) 157,944 Mortgage backed obligations 104,242 106 (323 ) 104,025 Asset backed securities 271,292 186 (226 ) 271,252 Municipal securities 44,934 209 (6 ) 45,137 Foreign government obligations 18,014 42 (5 ) 18,051 U.S. agency obligations 16,076 16 (6 ) 16,086 Covered bonds 6,690 148 0 6,838 Total marketable securities $ 1,568,139 $ 2,480 $ (3,605 ) $ 1,567,014 The contractual maturities of the investments classified as marketable securities is as follows (in thousands): As of January 31, 2017 2016 Due within 1 year $ 104,631 $ 309,944 Due in 1 year through 5 years 494,127 1,240,711 Due in 5 years through 10 years 3,580 16,359 $ 602,338 $ 1,567,014 73 Table of Contents As of January31, 2017 , the following marketable securities were in an unrealized loss position (in thousands): Less than 12 Months 12MonthsorGreater Total Fair Value Unrealized Losses FairValue Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Corporate notes and obligations $ 121,810 $ (1,528 ) $ 1,997 $ (3 ) $ 123,807 $ (1,531 ) U.S. treasury securities 49,945 (674 ) 0 0 49,945 (674 ) Mortgage backed obligations 60,187 (669 ) 0 0 60,187 (669 ) Asset backed securities 51,420 (187 ) 1,193 (10 ) 52,613 (197 ) Municipal securities 20,457 (183 ) 0 0 20,457 (183 ) Foreign government obligations 8,280 (36 ) 0 0 8,280 (36 ) $ 312,099 $ (3,277 ) $ 3,190 $ (13 ) $ 315,289 $ (3,290 ) The unrealized loss for each individual fixed rate marketable securities was less than $0.2 million . The Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of January31, 2017 , such as the Company's intent to hold and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment's amortized basis. The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities.
Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains, and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The components of investment income are presented below (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 Interest income $ 21,901 $ 14,146 $ 10,129 Realized gains 7,858 3,287 517 Realized losses (2,385 ) (2,092 ) (608 ) Total investment income $ 27,374 $ 15,341 $ 10,038 Reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income (loss) were immaterial for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Strategic Investments As of January31, 2017 , the Company had six investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $41.0 million , which include an unrealized gain of $24.5 million . As of January31, 2016 , the Company had six investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $16.2 million , which included an unrealized gain of $8.5 million . The change in the fair value of the investments in publicly held companies is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within strategic investments and accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The Companys interest in non-marketable debt and equity securities consists of noncontrolling equity investments in privately held companies. The Companys investments in these privately held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred.  These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Company's judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.  Fair value is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the fair value of the investment.
As of January31, 2017 and 2016 , the carrying value of the Companys non-marketable debt and equity securities was $526.0 million and $504.5 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of the non-marketable debt and equity securities was approximately $758.3 million and $714.1 million as of January31, 2017 and January31, 2016 , respectively. These investments are measured using the cost method of accounting, therefore the unrealized gains of $232.3 million and $209.6 million as of January31, 2017 and January31, 2016 , respectively, are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
74 Table of Contents Strategic investments consisted of the following (in thousands): Description Balance at beginningof year Additions Sales, dispositions and fair market value adjustments (1) Balance at end of year Fiscal year ended January31, 2017 $ 520,721 110,329 (64,097 ) $ 566,953 Fiscal year ended January31, 2016 $ 175,774 386,219 (41,272 ) $ 520,721 (1) Amounts include the release of the cost-basis and the current unrealized gain or loss balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss when shares of a publicly-held investment are sold, disposition-related reductions of a cost-basis investment if a privately-held company within the portfolio is acquired by another company, fair market value adjustments such as cost basis reductions related to impairments that are other-than-temporary and unrealized gains or losses related to investments held in publicly traded companies.
The carrying value of the Companys strategic investments is affected by various events such as entering into new investments, disposition-relatedreductionsofacost-basisinvestmentifaprivately-held company within the portfolio isacquiredbyanother company, fair market value adjustments including impairments or initial public offerings. The cash inflows from exits and cash outflows from new investments are disclosed as Strategic investments, net, within the investing activities section of the Statement of Cash Flows and any gains or losses or fair market value adjustments are recorded within the operating activities of the Statement of Cash Flows for each of the respective fiscal year periods.
3. Derivatives Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in British Pound Sterling, the Euro and Japanese Yen. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January31, 2017 and 2016 , the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled were recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.
Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands): As of January 31, 2017 2016 Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts $ 1,280,953 $ 1,274,515 Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts $ 10,205 $ (9,294 ) The fair value of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands): 75 Table of Contents FairValueofDerivativeInstruments As of January 31, BalanceSheet Location 2017 2016 Derivative Assets Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign currency derivative contracts Prepaidexpensesand other current assets $ 13,238 $ 4,731 Derivative Liabilities Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign currency derivative contracts Accounts payable, accrued expenses and otherliabilities $ 3,033 $ 14,025 The effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, are summarized below (in thousands): DerivativesNotDesignatedasHedging Instruments Gains (losses)onDerivativeInstruments Recognizedin Otherincome (expense) Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Location 2017 2016 2015 Foreign currency derivative contracts Other expense $ (86,239 ) $ (25,786 ) $ (1,186 ) 4. Fair Value Measurement All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level1 or Level2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs.
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level1.
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2.
Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level3.
Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January31, 2017 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): 76 Table of Contents Description QuotedPricesin Active Markets forIdenticalAssets (Level1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level3) Balancesasof January 31, 2017 Cash equivalents (1): Time deposits $ 0 $ 25,100 $ 0 $ 25,100 Money market mutual funds 956,479 0 0 956,479 Marketable securities: Corporate notes and obligations 0 320,640 0 320,640 U.S. treasury securities 0 61,823 0 61,823 Mortgage backed obligations 0 74,252 0 74,252 Asset backed securities 0 101,790 0 101,790 Municipal securities 0 33,375 0 33,375 Foreign government obligations 0 10,458 0 10,458 Foreign currency derivative contracts (2) 0 13,238 0 13,238 Total Assets $ 956,479 $ 640,676 $ 0 $ 1,597,155 Liabilities Foreign currency derivative contracts (3) $ 0 $ 3,033 $ 0 $ 3,033 Total Liabilities $ 0 $ 3,033 $ 0 $ 3,033 _____________ (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January31, 2017 , in addition to $625.0 million of cash.

Debt Convertible Senior Notes Par Value Outstanding Equity Component Recorded at Issuance LiabilityComponentofParValueasof January 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April1, 2018 $ 1,150,000 $ 122,421 (1) $ 1,116,360 $ 1,088,097 ___________ (1) This amount represents the equity component recorded at the initial issuance of the 0.25% convertible senior notes.
In March 2013, the Company issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes) due April1, 2018 , unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on April1 and October1 of each year.
The 0.25% Senior Notes are governed by an indenture between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 0.25% Senior Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.
If converted, holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will receive cash equal to the principal amount, and at the Companys election, cash, shares of the Companys common stock, or a combination of cash and shares, for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts.
Certain terms of the conversion features of the 0.25% Senior Notes are as follows: Conversion Rateper$1,000 Par Value Initial Conversion Price per Share ConvertibleDate 0.25% Senior Notes 15.0512 $ 66.44 January1, 2018 89 Table of Contents Throughout the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including any cash dividends. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited.
Holders may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes under the following circumstances:  during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day;  in certain situations, when the trading price of the 0.25% Senior Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate;  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the 0.25% Senior Notes indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or  at any time on or after the convertible date noted above (as described in the indenture).
Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the 0.25% Senior Notes in connection with such change of control.
In accounting for the issuances of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Company separated the 0.25% Senior Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 0.25% Senior Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.
In accounting for the transaction costs related to the 0.25% Senior Notes issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on its relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders equity.
The 0.25% Senior Notes consisted of the following (in thousands): As of January 31, 2017 2016 Liability component : Principal (1) $ 1,150,000 $ 1,150,000 Less: debt discount, net (2) (29,954 ) (54,941 ) Less: debt issuance cost (3) (3,686 ) (6,962 ) Net carrying amount $ 1,116,360 $ 1,088,097 (1) The effective interest rates of the 0.25% Senior Notes is 2.53% . These interest rates were based on the interest rates of a similar liability at the time of issuance that did not have an associated convertible feature.
(2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (which is classified as a noncurrent liability) and is amortized over the life of the 0.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method.
(3) In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability rather than an asset that is amortized. The Company retrospectively adopted this standard for the prior period presented.
The total estimated fair values of the Companys 0.25% Senior Notes at January31, 2017 was $1.5 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2017 .
90 Table of Contents Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $79.10 on January31, 2017, the if-converted value of the 0.25% Senior Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $219.1 million . Based on the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Senior Notes were not convertible at any time during the fiscal year ended January31, 2017 .

The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges do not impact earnings per share.

The 0.25% Warrants were anti-dilutive for the periods presented. The 0.25% Warrants are separate transactions entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes or the 0.25% Note Hedges.

The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.
The borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% , in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period.

10. Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Inducement Plan). The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (1999 Plan) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan.
94 Table of Contents On July 10, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Inducement Plan with a reserve of 335,000 shares of common stock for future issuance solely for the granting of inducement stock options and equity awards to new employees, including employees of acquired companies. In addition, approximately 319,000 shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Prior Inducement Plan) as of July 9, 2014 were added to the 2014 Inducement Plan share reserve and the Prior Inducement Plan was terminated. Further, any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Inducement Plan that expire, are forfeited, or are repurchased by the Company will also become available for future grant under the 2014 Inducement Plan. Termination of the Prior Inducement Plan did not affect the outstanding awards previously issued thereunder. The 2014 Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval in reliance on the employment inducement exemption provided under the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.
In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the ESPP. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January31, 2017 , $48.4 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Employees purchased 3.2 million shares for $126.1 million and 3.0 million shares for $155.0 million , in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, under the ESPP.
Prior to February1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years . From February1, 2006 through July3, 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July3, 2013, options issued have a term of seven years years.
The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Stock Options 2017 2016 2015 Volatility 31.4 -32.3 % 32-37 % 37 % Estimated life 3.5 years 3.5 years 3.6 years Risk-free interest rate 0.89-1.55% % 1.09-1.42 % 1.12-1.53 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 19.13 $ 20.22 $ 17.20 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, ESPP 2017 2016 2015 Volatility 28.2-35.2 % 30-34 % 32-35 % Estimated life 0.75 years 0.75 years 0.75 years Risk-free interest rate 0.47-0.98 % 0.06-0.76 % 0.07-0.23 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 20.18 $ 19.49 $ 14.56 The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.
The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The estimated life of the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.
The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.
During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer as well as to other executive officers subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. These performance-based restricted stock units will vest simultaneously if the performance condition is achieved.

During fiscal 2017 , the Company recognized stock-based expense of $820.4 million . As of January31, 2017 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $2.6 billion . It is expected that this stock compensation balance will be amortized as follows: $980.5 million during fiscal 2018 ; $762.9 million during fiscal 2019 ; $540.5 million during fiscal 2020 ; $249.7 million during fiscal 2021 ; $17.4 million during fiscal 2022 ; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023 ; $8.0 million during fiscal 2024 .

The expense related to these awards, which was expensed immediately at the time of the issuance, totaled $4.7 million , $4.8 million and $5.0 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. As of January31, 2017 and 2016 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.

Income Taxes The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 Domestic $ 65,432 $ (49,558 ) $ (211,253 ) Foreign (40,049 ) 113,837 (1,832 ) $ 25,383 $ 64,279 $ (213,085 ) 98 Table of Contents The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2017 2016 2015 Current: Federal $ 153 $ 40,723 $ 893 State 4,626 13,023 1,388 Foreign 71,878 57,347 50,493 Total 76,657 111,093 52,774 Deferred: Federal (182,848 ) 1,453 8,771 State (35,808 ) (426 ) (10,830 ) Foreign (12,250 ) (415 ) (1,112 ) Total (230,906 ) 612 (3,171 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (154,249 ) $ 111,705 $ 49,603 As described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, the Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017. The excess tax benefits resulted from the vesting or the settlement of the stock awards recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal 2017 were immaterial, after considering the change in the Company's valuation allowance. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company recorded the excess tax benefits of $59.5 million and $7.7 million directly to stockholders' equity, in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively.
In fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $154.2 million . The most significant component of this tax amount was the benefit of $210.3 million resulting from a partial release of its valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Company's pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the Company's valuation allowance position, it did not record significant current tax expense for the United States. In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. The Company had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock. In fiscal 2015 , the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions.
A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2017 2016 2015 U.S. federal taxes at statutory rate $ 8,884 $ 22,498 $ (74,580 ) State, net of the federal benefit 838 (5,260 ) (5,332 ) Foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate (1) 61,912 (25,780 ) 29,880 Change in valuation allowance (128,797 ) 139,565 100,143 Tax credits (50,216 ) (48,943 ) (28,056 ) Non-deductible expenses 47,836 26,841 26,224 Tax expense from acquisitions 568 1,584 2,341 Excess tax benefits related to shared based compensation (2) (95,030 ) 0 0 Other, net (244 ) 1,200 (1,017 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (154,249 ) $ 111,705 $ 49,603 (1) In fiscal 2016, most of the Altera related tax benefits was reflected in the foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate, which was partially offset by a change in valuation allowance.
99 Table of Contents (2) In fiscal 2017, due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, the excess tax benefits resulted from the vesting or the settlement of the stock awards were recorded in the tax provision, which was offset by the valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction.
The Company received certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. The tax reduction program in Switzerland expired in fiscal 2015, and the program in Singapore expired in fiscal 2016.
Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): As of January31, 2017 2016 Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 1,018,080 $ 260,015 Deferred stock-based expense 133,921 89,532 Tax credits 240,925 211,997 Deferred rent expense 65,779 49,790 Accrued liabilities 141,008 122,950 Deferred revenue 0 14,261 Basis difference on strategic and other investments 42,034 26,202 Financing obligation 140,539 127,198 Deferred cost sharing adjustment 30,351 30,351 Non-cash equity liability 26,155 0 Other 21,432 22,845 Total deferred tax assets 1,860,224 955,141 Less valuation allowance (948,386 ) (439,971 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 911,838 515,170 Deferred tax liabilities: Deferred commissions (139,641 ) (121,071 ) Purchased intangibles (408,203 ) (160,200 ) Unrealized gains on investments (8,547 ) (2,858 ) Depreciation and amortization (251,782 ) (224,435 ) Deferred revenue (98,997 ) 0 Other 0 (2,207 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (907,170 ) (510,771 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 4,668 $ 4,399 At January31, 2017 , for federal income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.7 billion , which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2038, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $196.1 million , which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2037, foreign tax credits of approximately $42.8 million , which expire in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2027, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million , which have no expiration date. For California income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $890.2 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2038, California research and development tax credits of approximately $157.3 million , which do not expire, and $9.5 million of enterprise zone tax credits, which expire in fiscal 2025.  For other states income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion which expire beginning in fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2037 and tax credits of approximately $17.1 million , which expire beginning in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2027. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.
The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected 100 Table of Contents future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. During fiscal 2017, the valuation allowance increased by $508.4 million . The net increase was primarily a result of the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, which was offset by the partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisitions. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward. The Company will adjust its valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years, for example, if the trend in increasing taxable income continues.
Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Expense The total income tax benefit related to stock-based awards was $228.8 million , $180.2 million and $170.8 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, the majority of which was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations The Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Certain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in countries including the United States and France. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $231.3 million , $172.7 million , and $146.2 million as of January31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 respectively.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2017 2016 2015 Balance as of February1, 2016 $ 172,741 $ 146,188 $ 102,275 Tax positions taken in prior period: Gross increases 18,254 7,456 17,938 Gross decreases (1,131 ) (7,264 ) (1,967 ) Tax positions taken in current period: 0 Gross increases 57,872 38,978 34,226 Settlements (15,598 ) (8,684 ) 0 Lapse of statute of limitations (1,261 ) (781 ) (1,224 ) Currency translation effect 440 (3,152 ) (5,060 ) Balance as of January31, 2017 $ 231,317 $ 172,741 $ 146,188 For fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $73.0 million , $56.2 million and $44.6 million , respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued penalties and interest in the amount of $0.2 million , $1.3 million and $1.3 million in income tax expense during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $6.7 million , $6.3 million and $4.6 million as of January31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2011 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, respectively.
The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2011 to 2012.  Additionally, examinations are conducted in other international jurisdictions, including France. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed examinations or effectively settled on tax positions with various taxing authorities and accordingly, decreased unrecognized tax 101 Table of Contents benefits by $15.6 million resulting from settlements. The Company regularly evaluates its uncertain tax positions and the likelihood of outcomes from these tax examinations. Significant judgment and estimates are necessary in the determination of income tax reserves. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties. However, the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future. However, in general, any adjustments resulting from the U.S. audits should not have an impact to the Company's tax provision due to its valuation allowance. In the next twelve months, as some of these ongoing examinations are completed and tax positions in these tax years meet the conditions of being effectively settled, the Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits up to approximately $12.0 million may occur.
12. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of potentially issuable shares is anti-dilutive.
A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 179,632 $ (47,426 ) $ (262,688 ) Denominator: Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings (loss) per share 687,797 661,647 624,148 Effect of dilutive securities: Convertible senior notes 1,906 0 0 Employee stock awards 10,514 0 0 Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings (loss) per share 700,217 661,647 624,148 The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 Employee Stock awards 10,527 26,615 22,157 Convertible senior notes 0 17,309 25,953 Warrants 17,309 17,309 37,517 13. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January31, 2017 , the Company had a total of $83.3 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.
Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates.
102 Table of Contents As of January31, 2017 , the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): Capital Leases Operating Leases Financing Obligation -Leased Facility(1) Fiscal Period: Fiscal 2018 $ 119,342 $ 463,250 $ 21,437 Fiscal 2019 115,791 413,435 21,881 Fiscal 2020 201,578 332,127 22,325 Fiscal 2021 36 266,253 22,770 Fiscal 2022 0 241,266 23,214 Thereafter 0 1,202,817 210,713 Total minimum lease payments 436,747 $ 2,919,148 $ 322,340 Less: amount representing interest (39,531 ) Present value of capital lease obligations $ 397,216 ______________ (1)  Total Financing Obligation -Leased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement noted in Note 5 Property and Equipment. As ofJanuary 31, 2017, $220.3 million of the total $322.3 million obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in "Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities" and the non-current portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options.
The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $2.9 billion , approximately $2.5 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment and furniture and fixtures.
Rent expense for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $226.0 million , $174.6 million and $162.8 million , respectively.
Other Purchase Commitments In April 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years .The agreement provides that the Company will pay $96.0 million in fiscal 2018, $108.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $126.0 million in fiscal 2020.
14. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States and a Registered Retirement Savings plan covering all eligible employees in Canada. Since January1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plans. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , were $56.4 million , $45.6 million and $38.1 million , respectively.
15. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.
In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted 103 Table of Contents to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter.
16. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the Salesforce.com Foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, was chartered on an idea of leveraging the Companys people, technology, and resources to help improve communities around the world. The Company calls this integrated philanthropic approach the 1-1-1 model. Beginning in 2008, Salesforce.org, which is a non-profit public benefit corporation, was established to resell the Company's services to nonprofit organizations and certain higher education organizations.
The Companys Chairman is the chairman of both the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The Companys Chairman holds one of the three Foundation board seats. The Companys Chairman, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of Salesforce.orgs nine board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations or Salesforce.org's activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of the related entities' statement of activities with its financial results.
Since the Foundations and Salesforce.orgs inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to those entities' employees such as office space, furniture, equipment, facilities, services, and other resources. The value of these items was approximately $3.3 million for the fiscal year 2017.
The resource sharing agreement was amended in August 2015 to include resources outside of the United States and is more explicit about the types of resources that the Company will provide.
Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions of the Companys services to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows Salesforce.org to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations and certain higher education entities. The Company does not charge Salesforce.org for these subscriptions, therefore revenue from subscriptions provided to non-profit organizations is donated back to the community through charitable grants made by the Foundation and Salesforce.org. For instance, the reseller agreement was amended in August 2015 to include additional customer segments and certain customers outside the U.S. and was amended in October 2015 to add an addendum with model clauses for the processing of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area. The value of the subscriptions pursuant to reseller agreements, as amended, was approximately $112.4 million for thefiscal year 2017. The Company plans to continue these programs.
As described in Note 6 Business Combinations, the Company's Chairman held an ownership interest in an acquisition that was completed by the Company in April 2016.
17. Subsequent Events In February 2017, the Company paid down the remaining $200.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. As of the filing date, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.
In February 2017, the Company acquired the outstanding stock of Sequence, Inc. (Sequence), a consulting firm that helps lead design-driven transformation by creating connected customer experiences. The Company acquired Sequence for its employees and product offerings. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017, the Company will include the financial results of Sequence in its condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The total estimated consideration for Sequence was approximately $18.0 million .

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
105 Table of Contents (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2017 based on the guidelines established inthe Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of Demandware, Inc. (Demandware), which we acquired in July 2016, as discussed in Note 6, Business Combinations, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included the financial results of Demandware in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total revenues subject to Demandwares internal control over financial reporting represented approximately one percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017. Total assets subject to Demandware's internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated total asset, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January31, 2017 .  Total net assets subject to Demandware's internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated net assets, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January31, 2017 .
Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January31, 2017 . We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
