PART I ITEM1.BUSINESS Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a strong focus on customer relationship management, or CRM, service offerings to our customers. Our company was founded on the concept of delivering CRM applications via the Internet, or cloud. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions.
Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. With our four core service offerings, involving sales force automation, customer service and support automation, marketing automation, and the platform, we provide a next generation customer platform.
Our service offerings are intuitive and easy-to-use, can be deployed rapidly, customized easily and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications, or apps. We deliver our solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems.
We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer 3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements tools, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new apps that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service.
In July 2013, we acquired ExactTarget, Inc. (ExactTarget), a leading global provider of cross-channel, digital marketing solutions that empower organizations of all sizes to communicate with their customers through the digital channels they use most. With the acquisition of ExactTarget, we have created a world-class marketing platform that enables companies to deliver personalized marketing campaigns across the digital channels of email, social, mobile and the web.
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999. Our principal executive offices are located in SanFrancisco, California and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com. Our office address is TheLandmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105.
The Cloud, Social and Mobile Revolution We believe that the convergence of cloud, social and mobile technologies has created billions of new connections between people and devices and is fundamentally transforming how companies sell, service, market and innovate.
Cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed. Organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers, storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps. Instead, companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an Internet browser or mobile device on an as-needed basis, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software in-house.
The broad shift to social networking has transformed the way people collaborate and is accelerating the adoption of technologies that connect people and products through feeds and status updates. There is a significant transition underway from desktops to smartphones and tablets, making it possible for people to get business done right from their mobile devices. And increasingly, customers want to be connected to the products they use.
Customers today are connected, empowered and demand a higher level of service and experience. We believe salesforce.com is at the forefront of connecting employees, partners, products and devices in order to help companies connect with their customers in new ways through this next generation of apps, devices and products.
Our Cloud Solutions We provide enterprise cloud computing solutions. We offer social and mobile cloud apps and platform services, as well as professional services to facilitate the adoption of our solutions. We provide solutions in each of our four core markets: sales, customer service, marketing and cloud platforms.
Our primary service offerings are as follows: Sales Cloud.
The Sales Cloud, which we also refer to as the Salesforce1 Sales Cloud, is a popular solution for sales force automation and it enables companies to grow their sales pipelines, close more deals, improve sales productivity and gain valuable business insights. Ourcustomers use the Sales Cloud to access accurate customer and prospect information, track leads and progress, forecast opportunities and collaborate around closing a sale on any device.The Sales Cloud also encompasses partner relationship management functionality (including channel management and partner communities) and real-time customer and contact information.
Service Cloud.
The Service Cloud, which we also refer to as the Salesforce1 Service Cloud, is a platform for customer service and it enables companies to connect with their customers and effectively address 4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements their service and support needs. Our customers use the Service Cloud to connect their customer service agents with customers on a multitude of devices and across every channelphone, email, chat, self-service web portals, social networks, online communities and directly within their own products and apps.
Marketing Cloud.
The Marketing Cloud, which we also refer to as the Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud, is a customer platform for one-to-one marketing and it enables companies to bring in data from any source and deliver personalized interactions (digital marketing) to any customer across any channelemail, mobile, social, web, or within their product. By combining our July 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget with our existing marketing automation solutions, we have created a world-class marketing platform that allows marketers to manage their digital marketing, including email, mobile, social, web, marketing automation and data analytics, from a single platform. With the Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud, customer data can be routed into the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in the form of leads, contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers.
Salesforce1 Platform.
The Salesforce1 Platform is a cloud platform for developing customer apps. Salesforce1 Platform is delivered as a service, enabling anyone to build business apps without the burden of managing hardware and software. Our customers use the Salesforce1 Platform to connect all of their apps, devices and customer data and make them available on any device. Salesforce1 Platform makes any app social and mobile by providing built-in social networking features, such as profiles, status updates and feeds, as well an interface that is optimized for viewing on mobile devices. With Salesforce1 Platform, developers, independent software vendors (ISVs), admins, employees and customers are able to access all their salesforce apps on any mobile device. Salesforce1 Platform gives customers the ability to create multiple copies of their organization in separate environments for a variety of purposes, such as testing and training.
Professional Services We offer consulting, deployment, training, implementation, integration and campaign services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our social and mobile cloud solutions. Our professional service engagements can be billed on a time and materials basis or through annual contracts. We offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as deploying, using, administering and developing on our service. We also offer classes for our partners who deploy our service on behalf of our customers. We bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person, per class basis. There is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers that subscribe to our service.
Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include: Secure, private, scalable and reliable .
Our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost-effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously.
Rapid deployment.
Our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products, or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary.
Ease of integration and configuration.
IT professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our 5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements solution with existing third-party, custom, and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Salesforce1 API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities.
High levels of user adoption.
We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users are more familiar with our user interface than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training.
Rapid development of apps using the Salesforce1 Platform.
Our customers and third-party developers can develop apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs, and also a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them to multiple mobile devices.
Increased innovation.
By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware and distribution. A developer with an idea for a new app can log onto our platforms, develop, test and support their system on the Salesforce1 Platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to his or her customers.
Lower total cost of ownership.
We enable customers to achieve significant up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately.
Our Strategy Our objective is to deliver solutions that help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. Not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps, we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners can build apps.
Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our solutions.
We designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to extend our core solutions with new features and functions and increased security. We also offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced CRM capabilities. We offer a range of editions to meet our customers CRM requirements. Through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships, we have strengthened and extended our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments in the future.
Extending distribution into new and high-growth categories.
As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new and high-growth categories, including marketing and cloud platforms. We are expanding our footprint in these areas to offer new social and mobile cloud innovations to our customers.
Expanding relationships with existing customers.
We see a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our service, we aim to upgrade the customer to higher priced editions, extend the duration of the customers contract and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization, and ultimately pursue enterprise-wide deployments.
Pursuing new customers.
We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes in top industries, primarily 6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service.
Reducing attrition.
Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers.
Building our business in top markets globally.
We also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service globally. We plan to continue to aggressively market to customers worldwide in our top global markets by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in the largest enterprise software markets around the world. Additionally, we plan to increase data center capacity by opening additional data centers in our top global markets.
Encouraging the development of third-party apps on our cloud computing platforms.
The Salesforce1 Platform enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud apps they have built on our multi-tenant platform. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published, and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our online marketplace for business apps, or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers.
Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our service as a highly scalable, multi-tenant app. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service. We have optimized our service to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than providing software that must be written to different hardware, operating system and database platforms, or that depends upon a customers unique systems environment. As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire companies or technologies, and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our service while maintaining the quality and security standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Performance, functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction.
Our service treats all customers as separate tenants in central applications, databases and other resources. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications.
Because of our multi-tenant architecture, we are able to provide all of our customers with a solution based on a single version of our apps.
Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features, functionality and services. In addition, from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology.
Our customers access our service over the Internet via all of the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems.
We provide our services to our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries.
7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012.
Sources of Revenue We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service. We also derive revenues from premier support, which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee.
We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis, for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered.
Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas.
Direct Sales We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. Our small business, commercial and enterprise account executives focus their efforts on small, mid-size and large enterprises, respectively.
Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects.
This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and regional partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. Also included in this network are ISVs, whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals.
We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service.
8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers.
Our primary marketing activities include:  Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition;  User conferences and events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness;  Social marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube;  Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties;  Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral;  Multi-channel marketing campaigns;  Use of customer testimonials; and  Sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers.
Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support for an additional fee, which includes services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and/or system administration.
Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis.
Competition The market for our offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, frequent introductions of new products and services, and as we have seen recently, consolidation. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.
We compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering CRM apps. We also compete with internally developed apps and may encounter competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include:  enterprise software application vendors; 9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  cloud computing application service providers;  software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality;  traditional platform development environment companies; and  cloud computing development platform companies.
We believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they will become a greater competitive threat.
Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information.
Employees As of January31, 2014, we had more than 13,300 employees. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union, however, for certain foreign subsidiaries, workers councils represent our employees.

ITEM1A.RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability.
Because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when 10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.
Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.
We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.
As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the United States. Companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted.
As we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service.
If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. Because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.
As we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment.
As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. In July 2013, we acquired ExactTarget, our largest acquisition in the companys history. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;  difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;  risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;  potential loss of key employees;  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;  the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;  the difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology;  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;  unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology;  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue;  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;  the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;  in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and  the tax effects of any such acquisitions.
In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline.
12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.
Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. In some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Unions e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations.
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.
The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance.
Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
Industry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business.
Our customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business.
In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.
13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed.
Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early.
As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
We rely on third-party computer hardware and software which could cause errors or failures of our service and may be difficult to replace.
We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. This hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service.
Our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.
Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year.
Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements;  the attrition rates for our service;  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;  changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity;  the number of new employees;  changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition;  the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service;  the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;  the length of the sales cycle for our service;  new product and service introductions by our competitors;  our success in selling our service to large enterprises;  variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service;  technical difficulties or interruptions in our service;  expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities;  conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio;  changes in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the United States and many countries in the European Union, changes in accounting principles, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period, results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, state and foreign taxing authorities, as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation;  changes to non-income taxes due to changes in federal, state or international tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions; changes in accounting principles; changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period;  our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships;  expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur;  general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates;  timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service;  regulatory compliance costs;  the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;  the impact of new accounting pronouncements;  equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders;  the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules; 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and  the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which is triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards.
Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.
Additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs.
Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business.
We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The markets for our Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of new services beyond the CRM market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate.
Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.
Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.
Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.
Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer.
The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.
The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include:  enterprise software application vendors;  cloud computing application service providers;  software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality;  traditional platform development environment companies; and  cloud computing development platform companies.
Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers.
As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.
17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed.
Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell.
Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.
We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure, research and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth.
We regularly upgrade and/or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted.
Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan.
As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.
As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.
Professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.
Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.
We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth.
Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales.
We sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. Historically, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together have represented approximately 30percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include:  localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;  laws and business practices favoring local competitors;  compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data protection and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers;  pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values of these balances;  regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders;  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;  foreign currency fluctuations and controls;  different pricing environments;  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property;  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties;  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and  regional economic and political conditions.
Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business.
19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.
We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters.
The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. For example, we received a notice from a large non-practicing entity alleging that we infringed upon certain of its patents. While no litigation was ever filed, in May 2013 we entered into a multi-year license agreement with the non-practicing entity that covered past period and future non-exclusive rights to its intellectual property.
In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both.
In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate and we also face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property.
We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.
Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.
We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the salesforce.com brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.
Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.
In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.
Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.
21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We expect to incur net GAAP losses in the future.
We have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter except one since July31, 2011. In addition, we expect our costs to increase as a result of decisions made for our long-term benefit, such as equity awards and business combinations. If our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs, we will not be able to return to profitability and we may continue to incur net losses, on a U.S. GAAP basis, in the future.
Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations.
We have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods, including our outstanding $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Senior Notes due January15, 2015, $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Senior Notes due April1, 2018, $300.0 million term loan maturing in July 2016 with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders and capital lease arrangements in excess of $500.0 million. Our maintenance of this indebtedness could have important consequences because:  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;  an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal beginning in 2015 or earlier if necessary;  it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and  limitations within the term loan covenants may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement.
Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.
A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and the term loan. Any required repayment of our notes and/or term loan as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.
We may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco. If we do not realize any benefits, our financial performance may be negatively impacted.
In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We may not realize any benefits with respect to the purchase of such real estate. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity on the land. If we commence efforts to develop the real estate, we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. In the event that we decide to sell this property, the sale price may be less than the recorded value of the land on our consolidated balance sheet, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.
22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The European Union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.
Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us.
Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.
Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.
The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our notes and underlying common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our notes and underlying common stock include:  variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;  forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share;  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;  announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;  announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;  recruitment or departure of key personnel;  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;  the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;  trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes;  issuance of debt or other convertible securities; and  any other factors discussed herein.
In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and underlying common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and underlying common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources.
We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.
We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock.
We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock.
There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for your notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in your receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes.
The fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.
The fundamental change purchase rights, will allow holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.
24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock.
We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions.
The hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.
We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control.
We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.
The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties.
Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;  provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders;  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill);  eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.
In addition, Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.
In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.
ITEM1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM2.PROPERTIES As of January31, 2014, our executive offices and principal offices for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development consist of over 1.1million square feet of leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel.
We also own approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in SanFrancisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and its options for the undeveloped real estate, which may include selling a portion of or all the real estate holdings, or suspending pre-construction activity for several more years.
We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. See Note10, Commitments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our lease commitments. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms.
ITEM3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.
We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results.
We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.
Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or cloud. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis.
Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. Our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. With our four core servicesSales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platformcustomers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Key elements of our strategy include:  strengthening our market-leading solutions;  extending distribution into high-growth markets;  expanding relationships with our existing customer base;  pursuing new customers;  reducing our attrition rates;  building our business in top markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help us add customers; and  encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms.
We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates.
To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a Social Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.
We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a GAAP basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis.
Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts are available for renewal. We calculate our attrition rates as of the end of each reporting period. We do not calculate the attrition rate for ExactTarget, Inc. (ExactTarget). Our attrition rate was in the high-single digit percentage range as of January31, 2014, declining from the low-double digit percentage range attrition rate as of January31, 2013. We expect our attrition rates to continue to decline slowly over time, as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and other related programs.
The majority of our subscription and support revenues are derived from subscriptions to our Sales Cloud.
We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 and 53percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying customers, and build greater brand awareness.
On March18, 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April1, 2018. In connection with the issuance of the debt, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. The note hedge transactions are designed, but not guaranteed, to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion.
On March20, 2013, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four-for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate.
In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years.
On July11, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a $300.0 million term loan due on July11, 2016. All amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for ExactTarget.
34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On July12, 2013, we acquired for cash the outstanding stock of ExactTarget, a leading global provider of cross-channel, digital marketing solutions. We acquired ExactTarget for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and to create a world-class marketing platform across the channels of email, social, mobile and the web. The financial results of ExactTarget are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for ExactTarget was approximately $2.6 billion.
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January31. References to fiscal 2014, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January31, 2014.
Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2)related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.
Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.
Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.
In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting EstimatesRevenue Recognition below.
Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. Year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Approximately 74 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2014.
Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: (in thousands) April30, 2013 July31, 2013 October31, 2013 January31, 2014 Fiscal 2014 Accounts receivable, net $ 502,609 $ 599,543 $ 604,045 $ 1,360,837 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,733,160 1,789,648 1,734,619 2,522,115 (in thousands) April30, 2012 July 31, 2012 October 31, 2012 January 31, 2013 Fiscal 2013 Accounts receivable, net $ 371,395 $ 446,917 $ 418,590 $ 872,634 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,334,716 1,337,184 1,291,703 1,862,995 (in thousands) April30, 2011 July 31, 2011 October 31, 2011 January 31, 2012 Fiscal 2012 Accounts receivable, net $ 270,816 $ 342,397 $ 312,331 $ 683,745 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 915,133 935,266 917,821 1,380,295 Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $4.5 billion as of January31, 2014 and approximately $3.5 billion as of January31, 2013. Also as a result, our typical contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer.
36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues.
Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.
We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.
Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.
We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies.
Marketing and Sales.
Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.
We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost.
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters.
37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Stock-Based Expenses.
Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.
During fiscal 2014, we recognized stock-based expense of $503.3 million. As of January31, 2014, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years was $1.4 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $596.3 million during fiscal 2015; $425.9 million during fiscal 2016; $251.0 million during fiscal 2017 and $100.2 million during fiscal 2018. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January31, 2014 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods.
Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies.
Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2)related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees.
We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  the service has been or is being provided to the customer;  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed.
Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.
Multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.
For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price.
We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.
Deferred Revenue.
The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter.
Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
Deferred Commissions.
We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.
During fiscal 2014, we deferred $265.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $194.6million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $232.6 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $154.8 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $324.9 million at January31, 2014 and $254.4 million at January31, 2013.
Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets . We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition.
We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.
Business Combinations.
Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:  future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;  the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and  discount rates.
Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
Stock-Based Options and Awards.
We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The fair value of each option or ESPP share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include:  The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period;  The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights;  The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights; and  The probability of performance conditions that effect the vesting of certain awards being achieved. Expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest.
Income Taxes.
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision.
Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
Our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the United States and many countries in the European Union, changes in accounting principles, adverse results of tax examinations as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders equity.
Strategic Investments . We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment.

Subscription and support revenues were $3.8billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.9billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $955.7million, or 33 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due almost entirely to volume-driven increases from new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in attrition rates as compared to a year ago. We have continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped reduce our attrition rates. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. The net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $181.4million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $65.1million, or 36 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.
45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1,171.2 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $244.7million, or 26 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our service internationally and reduced attrition rates. However, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies caused a decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of decreasing our aggregate revenues by $24.4million compared to the same period a year ago.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $102.8 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $48.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $80.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $32.1 million of which related to the amortization of acquired developed technology, an increase of $16.1 million in subcontractor and professional services expense, an increase of $23.1million in allocated overhead and an increase of $11.9 million in stock-based expenses. We have increased our customer support and professional services headcount by 58 percent since January31, 2013 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which the majority was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to cost of revenues which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $114.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $31.1 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $16.0 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $17.2 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $14.8 million in test data lab costs. We increased our research and development headcount by 31 percent since January31, 2013 in 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to research and development which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $357.1 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $57.2 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and an increase of $49.8 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 33 percent since January31, 2013. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base, while a portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $70.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $21.7 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $48.3 million in professional and outside services, which included transaction fees associated with the ExactTarget acquisition, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 28 percent since January31, 2013 as we added personnel to support our growth. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget.

Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $77.2 million for fiscal 2014 and was $30.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the March 2013 issuance of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes, the $300.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget and the large capital lease agreement for software which we entered into in June 2013.
Benefit from (provision for) Income Taxes.
Fiscal Year Ended January31, Variance Dollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ 125,760 $ (142,651 ) $ 268,411 Effective tax rate 35 % (112 )% We reported a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in the previous year and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1million for fiscal 2014.
We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013. Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets.
We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. See Note8 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our renewal rates. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods. Professional services and other revenues were $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $140.3million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.

The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major international currencies, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $43.9 million compared to fiscal 2012.

We increased our research and development headcount by 36 percent since January31, 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $305.9 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $83.6 million in stock-based expenses, $29.3 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and $23.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January31, 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses.

Investment income was $19.6 million during fiscal 2013 and was $23.3 million during fiscal 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower yields and interest rates on our portfolio compared to fiscal 2012.

Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $30.9 million during fiscal 2013 and was $17.0 million during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, we capitalized $2.4 million of interest costs related to capital projects. Capitalized interest during fiscal 2012 was $14.6 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to fiscal 2012.
Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.
FiscalYearEnded January31, Variance Dollars (in thousands) 2013 2012 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ (142,651 ) $ 21,745 $ (164,396 ) Effective tax rate (112 )% 65 % We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million during fiscal 2013, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent. The effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets.
51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million.
We recorded a tax benefit of $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and California tax credits and the impact of the Radian6 acquisition. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non-deductible amounts. The effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre-tax loss.
Liquidity and Capital Resources At January31, 2014, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion and accounts receivable of $1.4 billion.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $875.5 million during fiscal 2014 and $736.9 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts.
Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings.
As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.
We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers.
Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 increased $138.6 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. During fiscal 2014, $8.1 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans was reclassified to cash flows from financing activities, as compared to $14.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase in net cash in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital accounts, primarily an increase in accounts receivables and a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and other liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by approximately $30.0 million of payments made for the transaction fees incurred by ExactTarget and us related to the acquisition.
Net cash used in investing activities was $2.4 billion during fiscal 2014 and $938.9 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 primarily related to the acquisition of EdgeSpring, Inc. (EdgeSpring) in June 2013, the acquisition of ExactTarget in July2013, capital expenditures, including new office build-outs and a new intellectual property licensing agreement, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.6billion during fiscal 2014 and $334.5million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of $1.1billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $84.8million from proceeds from the issuance of warrants, $298.5million of proceeds from the term loan, net of loan fees, and $289.9million from proceeds from employee-related equity plans offset by $153.8million for the purchase of hedges on the convertible note, $41.1million of principal payments on capital leases and $15.0 million of principal payments on the term loan.
In July 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provides for a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) that matures on July11, 2016 (the Maturity Date). The Term Loan bears interest at our option under eithera LIBOR-based formula ora base rate formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends, and certain other restrictions on our activities as defined in the Credit Agreement.We were in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January31, 2014.
The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. As of January31 2014, the amount outstanding under the Term Loan was $285.0 million. Accrued interest on the Term Loan was $0.5million as of January31, 2014. During fiscal 2014, payments totaling $15.0 million were made on the Term Loan and subsequent payments of $7.5 million are due quarterly thereafter until the maturity date in July 2016 when the remaining outstanding principal amount is due.
In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January15, 2015 (the 0.75% Senior Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the 0.75% Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the 0.75% Warrants). The 0.75% Senior Notes will mature on January15, 2015, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.75% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both.
For the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes were convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending January31, 2014. For the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January31, 2014, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April30, 2014. As the 0.75% Senior Notes are due on January15, 2015, they are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January31, 2014.
During the quarter ending April 30, 2014, we will repay in cash an aggregate principal balance of at least $280.0million related to conversion requests of our 0.75% Senior Notes received through the date of the filing of 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements this Form10-K. The excess of the conversion value that is greater than the principal amount will be delivered in shares of our common stock for the majority of the conversion requests received to date. If our stock price continues to exceed the conversion price of our 0.75% Senior Notes, we may continue to see conversion requests on the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015.
In March 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April1, 2018 (the 0.25% Senior Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the 0.25% Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the 0.25% Warrants). The 0.25% Senior Notes will mature on April1, 2018, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.25% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both.
The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter commencing after April30, 2013, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January31, 2014, our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April30, 2014, and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet.
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S.treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.
As of January31, 2014, we have a total of $55.4 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.
We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and software and furniture and fixtures. At January31, 2014, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Lessthan 1Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Morethan 5Years Capital lease obligations $ 606,505 $ 77,455 $ 146,038 $ 183,012 $ 200,000 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 1,280,872 144,568 300,105 248,671 587,528 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 102,208 51,946 50,173 89 0 Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 1,733,842 573,875 5,750 1,154,217 0 Term loan 285,000 30,000 255,000 0 0 Financing obligation 335,824 0 18,654 42,658 274,512 Contractual commitments 5,950 5,950 0 0 0 $ 4,350,201 $ 883,794 $ 775,720 $ 1,628,647 $ 1,062,040 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The Financing Obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January31, 2014, $40.2 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progressleased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
During fiscal 2014 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade and/or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.
In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.
We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12months.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.
Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period.
We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur.
Stock-Based Expenses .The Companys compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.
55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Amortization of Purchased Intangibles.
The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.
Amortization of Debt Discount.
Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Companys $575.0 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010 and the Companys $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rates were approximately 5.9% for the notes issued in January 2010 and approximately 2.5% for the notes issued in March 2013, while the coupon interest rates were 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from managements assessment of the Companys operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance.
Income Tax Effects and Adjustments . The Companys non-GAAP tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal years ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items include, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Companys operational performance.
We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues.
We define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses.
Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation.
We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding.
Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position.
We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, gross profit, loss from operations, net loss and Net loss per share for the years ended January31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): For the Year Ended January31, Non-GAAP gross profit 2014 2013 2012 GAAP gross profit $ 3,102,575 $ 2,366,616 $ 1,777,653 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 109,356 77,249 60,069 Stock-based expenses 45,608 33,757 17,451 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 3,257,539 $ 2,477,622 $ 1,855,173 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP operating profit 2014 2013 2012 GAAP loss from operations $ (286,074 ) $ (110,710 ) $ (35,085 ) Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 146,535 88,171 67,319 Stock-based expenses 503,280 379,350 229,258 Non-GAAP operating profit $ 363,741 $ 356,811 $ 261,492 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP net income 2014 2013 2012 GAAP net loss $ (232,175 ) $ (270,445 ) $ (11,572 ) Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 146,535 88,171 67,319 Stock-based expenses 503,280 379,350 229,258 Amortization of debt discount, net 46,942 23,837 12,335 Less: Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (242,729 ) 21,629 (103,730 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 221,853 $ 242,542 $ 193,610 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(a) 2014 2013 2012 GAAP diluted loss per share $ (0.39 ) $ (0.48 ) $ (0.02 ) Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.23 0.15 0.12 Stock-based expenses 0.79 0.64 0.40 Amortization of debt discount, net 0.07 0.04 0.02 Less: Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (0.35 ) 0.06 (0.18 ) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.35 $ 0.41 $ 0.34 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share 635,688 596,280 569,180 (a) Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split of our common stock through a stock dividend which occurred in April 2013.
The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the years ended January31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British PoundSterling, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion at January31, 2014. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least triple BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.
An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January31, 2014 could result in a $8.8 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.
At January31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $16.7 million.
Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the 0.75% Senior Notes) and in March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes) (collectively the Notes). Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amounts of the Notes, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes.
The 0.75% Senior Notes and the 0.25% Senior Notes have fixed annual interest rates of 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our 0.75% Senior Notes was $542.2 million and the carrying value of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.0 billion as of January31, 2014, which represents the liability components of the $568.9 million principal balance and $1.15 billion principal balance, respectively. The total estimated fair values of our 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes at January31, 2014 were $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which were $283.78 and $115.29, respectively.
In July 2013, we entered into a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) which matures in July 2016 and bears interest at our option of either a base rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus a spread of 1.50% to 2.00%. The Company entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of ExactTarget. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for the loan bearing interest as described above at the end of an interest period. The Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments equal to $7.5 million beginning in September 2013, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity.
By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR.The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.
We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January31, 2014 and January31, 2013 the fair value of our investments in privately-held companies was $77.0 million and $46.8 million, respectively.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a provider of enterprise cloud computing services. The Company is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. With four core service offerings, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform, the Company provides a next generation customer platform.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January31. References to fiscal 2014, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January31, 2014.
Basis of Presentation On March20, 2013, the Companys certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four-for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:  the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements,  the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations,  the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes,  the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies,  the estimate of real estate sublease rental rates and market conditions,  the fair value of the convertible notes,  the fair value of stock awards issued and related forfeiture rates,  the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, and  the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property and equipment, goodwill and identified intangibles).
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts.
No customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012.
Geographic Locations As of January31, 2014 and 2013, assets located outside the Americas were 12 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively.
Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2014 2013 2012 Americas $ 2,899,837 $ 2,123,736 $ 1,540,289 Europe 741,220 525,304 408,456 Asia Pacific 429,946 401,155 317,794 $ 4,071,003 $ 3,050,195 $ 2,266,539 Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent, 94 percent and 93 percent in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1)subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2)related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees.
The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  the service has been or is being provided to the customer;  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers.
Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of the Companys professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed.
Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.
Multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.
71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price.
The Company determined BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.
Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter.
Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.
Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force.
The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.
Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income.
Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value.
The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 2, Investments.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: Computer, equipment and software 3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the lease term or 10 years Building improvements Amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.
Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Impairment Assessments The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations.
Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement.
The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.
The Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. The Company will continue to account for the facility as a financing obligation upon completion of the construction project.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. Stock-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.
74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: Fiscal Year Ended January31, Stock Options 2014 2013 2012 Volatility 37 - 43 % 43 - 51 % 47 - 51 % Estimated life 3.4 years 3.7 years 3.7 years Risk-free interest rate 0.48-1.21 % 0.43-0.77 % 0.68-1.77 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 14.08 $ 12.94 $ 12.29 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, ESPP 2014 2013 2012 Volatility 31-35 % 39-46 % 50-53 % Estimated life 0.75years 0.75years 0.75years Risk-free interest rate 0.07-0.10 % 0.03-0.22 % 0.95-1.08 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 10.30 $ 11.39 8.59 The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights.
The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The estimated life for the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period.The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights.
Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $155.8 million, $110.7 million and $80.3million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world.The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits.The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements available under the tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net loss for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates.
Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances.
The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions.
New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No.2012-02, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350)Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. ASU 2012-02 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Otherwise, the quantitative impairment test is not required. The Company adopted ASU 2012-02 in fiscal 2014. The adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11), which provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefitwhen a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.ASU 2013-11 supports the approach for companies to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a NOL or tax credit carryforward whenever the NOL or tax credit carryforward would be available to reduce the additional taxable income or tax due if the tax position is disallowed. This approach requires companies to assess whether to net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset as of the reporting date. The Company adopted ASU 2013-11 in fiscal 2014 and the adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

The Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of January31, 2014. The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities.
Fair Value Measurement All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level1 or Level2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs.
During fiscal 2014, the Company transferred certain amounts within the fair value hierarchy. U.S. treasury securities and Foreign government obligations at January31, 2014 are now reported as Level 2 fair value instruments rather than Level 1 based on market activity.
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level1.
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2.
Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level3.
Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.

Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in Euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars and British pounds. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January31, 2014 and 2013, the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.

As of January31, 2014, the fair value of the Companys marketable equity securities of $15.5 million includes an unrealized gain of $13.3 million. As of January31, 2013, the Company had four investments in marketable equity securities which had a fair value of $4.9 million which included an unrealized gain of $1.7 million. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Companys interest in non-marketable equity and debt securities consists of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies. The Companys investments in these privately-held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Companys judgment due to the absence of market price and inherent lack of liquidity.

(2) This amount represents the equity component recorded at the initial issuance of the 0.25% convertible senior notes.
In January 2010, the Company issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes (the 0.75% Senior Notes) due January15, 2015, unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January15 and July15 of each year. In March 2013, the Company issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes, and together with the 0.75% Senior Notes, the Notes) due April1, 2018, unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on April1 and October1 of each year commencing October1, 2013.
The Notes are governed by indentures between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.

Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert their Notes under the following circumstances:  during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day;  in certain situations, when the trading price of the Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate;  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the Notes Indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or  at any time on or after the convertible dates noted above.
Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the Notes in connection with such change of control.
In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.
In accounting for the transaction costs related to the Note issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in temporary stockholders equity and stockholders equity. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $51.1 million in connection with the 0.75% Senior Notes.

(3) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (which is classified as a noncurrent liability) and is amortized over the life of the 0.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method.
The total estimated fair values of the Companys 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes at January31, 2014 were $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2014.
Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $60.53 on January31, 2014, the if-converted value of the 0.75% Senior Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $1.0 billion and the if-converted value of the 0.25% Senior Notes was less than their principal amount.
Through the filing of this Form10-K, the Company has received conversion notices on our 0.75% Senior Notes for approximately $280.0 million in aggregate principal balance that the Company will settle in fiscal 2015.
Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges).

The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Company initially recorded a deferred tax asset of $51.4 million in connection with the 0.75% Note Hedges. The Note Hedges do not impact earnings per share.

As the average market value per share of the Companys common stock for the reporting period, as measured under the 0.75% Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the 0.75% Warrants, the 0.75% Warrants would have a dilutive effect on the Companys earnings/loss per share if the Company were to report net income for fiscal 2014. The Warrants were anti-dilutive for the periods presented. The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes and Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants.
Term Loan On July11, 2013, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders.

The Company entered into the Term Loan in conjunction with and for purposes of funding the acquisition of ExactTarget.
Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for the loan bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of the loan bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. The Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments equal to $7.5 million beginning on September30, 2013, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable on the Maturity Date. The Company may prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part at any time during the term of the Term Loan. Amounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed under the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan is secured by a pledge of 100 percent of the equity securities of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65 percent of the equity securities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries.
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends, and certain other restrictions on the Companys activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement.The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January31, 2014.
The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. As of January31, 2014, the current portion outstanding under the Term Loan was $30.0 million and the noncurrent outstanding portion was $255.0 million. Future principal payments on the Term Loan are payable as follows: $30.0 million during fiscal 2015; $30.0 million during fiscal 2016; and $235.0 million during fiscal 2017.

7. Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan), 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.

In addition, 21.9million shares of common stock that were previously available for grant under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan (collectively, the Prior Plans) as of June6, 2013, expired and were added to the 2013 Plan share reserve. Any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plans that expire, are forfeited, or repurchased by the Company also will be available for future grant under the 2013Plan.
In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the ESPP. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January31, 2014, $23.9million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the plan and is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities.

During fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a partial release of its valuation allowance primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was recorded for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Companys pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014.
During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded net tax benefits that resulted from allocating certain tax effects related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stocks directly to stockholders equity in the amount of $8.0 million, $7.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

These temporary tax reduction programs will both expire in fiscal 2016.
Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): As of January31, 2014 2013 Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 259,465 $ 62,603 Deferred stock compensation 82,840 69,593 Tax credits 107,381 75,812 Deferred rent expense 47,063 28,022 Accrued liabilities 79,235 63,257 Deferred revenue 8,522 30,441 Basis difference on investment 11,999 8,569 Financing obligation 63,673 0 Other 17,762 9,916 Total deferred tax assets 677,940 348,213 Less valuation allowance (180,223 ) (192,682 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 497,717 155,531 Deferred tax liabilities: Deferred commissions (87,625 ) (72,470 ) Purchased intangibles (259,409 ) (14,739 ) Unrealized gains on investments (5,232 ) (2,768 ) Depreciation and amortization (144,752 ) (41,832 ) Other (3,599 ) (7,351 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (500,617 ) (139,160 ) Net deferred tax assets $ (2,900 ) $ 16,371 At January31, 2014, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1.8 billion, which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2034, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $72.8 million, which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2034, foreign tax credits of approximately $15.4million, which expires in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2024, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million, which have no expiration date. The Company also had net operating loss carryforwards for California of 101 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements approximately $794.6 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2034 and state research and development tax credits of approximately $68.1 million, which do not expire, and $9.5 million of state enterprise zone tax credits, which expires in fiscal 2024. Company also had other states net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $600.0 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2034. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.
The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of its deferred taxes to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers its cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. During fiscal 2014, the valuation allowance decreased by $12.5 million. The net reduction was primarily due to the partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget offset with the increase in the valuation allowance due to current year operating losses. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly.
The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when the tax deduction is realized on the income tax returns. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but are not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2014 and 2013 are $408.8million and $316.2 million, respectively.
Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Compensation The total income tax benefit related to stock-based awards was $147.8 million $113.9 million and $76.0million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, the majority of which was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance since fiscal 2013.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $102.3 million, $75.1 million and $52.0 million as of January31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012 is as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2014 2013 2012 Balance as of February1, $ 75,144 $ 51,971 $ 27,462 Tax positions taken in prior period: Gross increases 8,420 7,304 10,008 Gross decreases (4,466 ) (4,460 ) (23 ) Tax positions taken in current period: Gross increases 27,952 24,401 15,965 Settlements 0 (121 ) 0 Lapse of statute of limitations (5,205 ) (4,159 ) (1,143 ) Currency translation effect 430 208 (298 ) Balance as of January31, $ 102,275 $ 75,144 $ 51,971 102 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $34.9 million, $32.3million, and $39.1 million respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S. since fiscal 2013.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued penalties and interest in the amount of $0.6 million, $0.3 million and $0.6 million in income tax expense during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $3.3 million, $1.7 million and $1.4 million as of January31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2008 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, respectively.
In fiscal 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and California Franchise Tax Board began its examinations for the Companys tax returns for the periods covering fiscal 2011 to 2012 and fiscal 2009 to 2010 respectively. The Company also has examinations in other international jurisdictions, including Canada, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. The Company regularly evaluates its uncertain tax positions and the likelihood of outcomes from these tax examinations. Significant judgment and estimates are necessary in the determination of income tax reserves. Although it is often difficult to predict the outcomes of tax examinations, the Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties. In the next twelve months, the Company does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits balance to materially change due to the uncertainty with these on-going examinations.
9. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of potentially issuable shares would be anti-dilutive.
A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2014 2013 2012 Numerator: Net loss $ (232,175 ) $ (270,445 ) $ (11,572 ) Denominator: Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic loss per share 597,613 564,896 541,208 Effect of dilutive securities: Convertible senior notes 0 0 0 Employee stock awards 0 0 0 Warrants 0 0 0 Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted loss per share 597,613 564,896 541,208 103 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January31, 2014 2013 2012 Stock awards 19,664 30,068 30,240 Convertible senior notes 43,965 26,940 26,940 Warrants 44,253 26,944 26,944 10. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January31, 2014, the Company had a total of $55.4 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.
Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates.
As of January31, 2014, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): Capital Leases Operating Leases Financing Obligation, Building in ProgressLeased Facility(1) Fiscal Period: Fiscal 2015 $ 77,455 $ 196,514 $ 0 Fiscal 2016 72,193 189,757 1,777 Fiscal 2017 73,845 160,521 16,877 Fiscal 2018 83,369 129,733 21,107 Fiscal 2019 99,643 119,027 21,551 Thereafter 200,000 587,528 274,512 Total minimum lease payments 606,505 $ 1,383,080 $ 335,824 Less: amount representing interest (88,260 ) Present value of capital lease obligations $ 518,245 (1) Total Financing Obligation, Building in ProgressLeased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement noted in Footnote 3, Property and Equipment, and includes $40.2 million that was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progressleased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet.
The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options.
The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred 104 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $1.4 billion, approximately $1.3billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment, other leases, data center capacity and our development and test data center.
Rent expense for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $123.6 million, $88.3 million and $70.3million, respectively.
11. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States. Since January1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, were $27.9 million, $22.1 million and $15.7 million, respectively.
12. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement.
In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter.
13. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the salesforce.com/foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, a non-profit public charity, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are focused on youth and technology. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. The Companys chairman, two of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold four of the Foundations ten board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundations statement of activities with its financial results.
Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items was approximately $997,000 for fiscal 2014.
Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows an affiliate of the Foundation to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations. The Company does not charge the affiliate for these subscriptions, so any revenue from subscriptions provided to non-profit organizations is retained by the Foundation to fund its charitable work. The value of the subscriptions was approximately $15.1 million for fiscal 2014. The Company plans to continue these programs.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None.
ITEM9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
(b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2014 based on the 1992 framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of ExactTarget, Inc. (ExactTarget), which we acquired July 12, 2013, as discussed in Note 4, Business Combinations, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included the financial results of ExactTarget in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total revenues subject to ExactTargets internal control over financial reporting represented less than five percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Total assets and net assets subject to ExactTargets internal control over financial reporting represented less than four percent and less than six percent, respectively, of our consolidated total assets and consolidated net assets, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January31, 2014.
107 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January31, 2014. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
