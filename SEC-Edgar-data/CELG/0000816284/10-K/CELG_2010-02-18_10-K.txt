BUSINESS  We are a multinational integrated biopharmaceutical company, incorporated in 1986 as a Delaware corporation. We are primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune-inflammatory-related diseases. Over the last several years, total revenues have steadily grown led by sales of THALOMID(R) (thalidomide), our lead product, which is currently marketed for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, but more widely used off-label for treating multiple myeloma and other cancers. The sales growth of THALOMID(R) has enabled us to make substantial investments in research and development, which has advanced our broad portfolio of drug candidates in our product pipeline, including a pipeline of IMiDs(R) compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties.  We had total revenue of $536.9 million and net income of $63.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. We had an accumulated deficit of $170.8 million at December 31, 2005 and have since our inception in 1986 financed our working capital requirements primarily through product sales, private and public sales of our debt and equity securities, income earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of such securities and revenues from research contracts and license payments.  On December 27, 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, approved REVLIMID(R) (lenalidomide), our most clinically advanced IMiDs(R) compound, for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low-or intermediate-1- risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. REVLIMID(R) will be distributed through contracted pharmacies under the RevAssist(sm) program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of REVLIMID(R). We believe that REVLIMID(R) has significant commercial sales potential as a result of the clinical data presented at major medical meetings and the clinical findings reported in major peer-reviewed medical publications. We are executing our REVLIMID(R) launch strategy in the United States by leveraging our U.S. hematological-oncology sales force.  We are dedicated to innovative research and development designed to bring new therapies to market. We are involved in research in several scientific areas that may deliver proprietary next-generation therapies, such as cellular signaling biology, immunomodulation and placental stem cell research. The drugs we develop are designed to treat life-threatening diseases or chronic debilitating conditions where patients are poorly served by current therapies. Building on our growing knowledge of the biology underlying hematological and solid tumor cancers, we are investing in a range of innovative therapeutic programs that are investigating ways to attack the disease source through multiple mechanisms of action and intracellular pathways.  ACQUISITIONS  On August 31, 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., now Celgene Research San Diego, a privately held San Diego-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes and proteins associated with diseases. Celgene Research San Diego now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.                                         1 On December 31, 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., now Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing the technology for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissues following the completion of full-term, successful pregnancies. Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.  On October 21, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Penn T Limited, the UK-based supplier of THALOMID(R). This acquisition expanded our corporate capabilities and enabled us to control manufacturing for THALOMID(R) worldwide. Through manufacturing contracts acquired in this purchase, we also increased our participation in the potential growth of THALOMID(R) revenues in key international markets. Penn T Limited, or Penn T, now operates as Celgene U.K. Manufacturing II, or CUK II.  COMMERCIAL STAGE PROGRAMS  Our commercial programs include pharmaceutical sales of REVLIMID(R), THALOMID(R), and ALKERAN(R) and sales of FOCALIN(TM) to Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis; a licensing agreement with Novartis which entitles us to royalties on FOCALIN XR(TM) and the entire RITALIN(R) family of drugs; a licensing and product supply agreement with Pharmion Corporation for its sales of thalidomide; and sales of bio-therapeutic products and services through our Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary.  REVLIMID(R) (LENALIDOMIDE): REVLIMID(R) is an oral immunomodulatory drug recently granted approval by the FDA for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, or MDS, with the 5q chromosomal deletion. REVLIMID(R) is being distributed through contracted pharmacies under the RevAssist(sm) program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution program tailored specifically for REVLIMID(R). The FDA based its decision to grant marketing approval on data from the open label Phase II trial (MDS-003) that evaluated REVLIMID(R) in transfusion-dependent patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality.  We have filed a Supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, with the FDA seeking approval to market REVLIMID(R) as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The FDA has granted this sNDA Priority Review designation and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA date of June 30, 2006. Other efforts directed toward gaining additional regulatory approval of REVLIMID(R) include the acceptance of our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, on October 26, 2005 by the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, for the treatment of patients with MDS with the 5q chromosomal deletion and plans to submit an MAA to the EMEA as a treatment in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma based on clinical data from two Phase III Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, trials (MM-009 and MM-010), in the first quarter of 2006. We also submitted an MAA for REVLIMID(R) to the Swiss Intercantonal Medicines Control Office seeking approval to market REVLIMID(R) as a treatment for patients with MDS with the 5q chromosomal deletion. Plans are being developed to submit REVLIMID(R) for regulatory approval in other international markets.  REVLIMID(R) continues to be investigated in clinical trials as a potential treatment for blood cancers that affect more than 700,000 patients worldwide. The most advanced clinical studies evaluating REVLIMID(R) are Phase III trials - in the United States (MM-009) and in Europe (MM-010) for previously treated multiple myeloma patients, and Phase III trials in Europe (MDS-004) in MDS. There are more than 50 clinical trials currently evaluating REVLIMID(R) either alone or in combination with one or more other therapies in the treatment of a broad range of debilitating diseases, including multiple myeloma,                                         2 myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, amyloidosis, myeloid fibrosis and other cancers. The Southwest Oncology Group, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, three of the largest adult cancer clinical trial organizations in the world, are evaluating REVLIMID(R) for large clinical studies in randomized controlled Phase III trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of REVLIMID(R) in multiple myeloma.  THALOMID(R) (THALIDOMIDE): THALOMID(R), which had net product sales totaling $387.8 million, $308.6 million and $223.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, was approved by the FDA in July 1998 for the treatment of acute cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, an inflammatory complication of leprosy. Although leprosy is relatively rare in the United States, the disease afflicts millions worldwide. ENL occurs in about 30% of leprosy patients and is characterized by skin lesions, acute inflammation, fever and anorexia. While approved for the treatment of ENL, THALOMID(R) is widely prescribed off-label for treating multiple myeloma and other cancers. The FDA is currently reviewing our sNDA for THALOMID(R) in multiple myeloma and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date of May 25, 2006.  Working with the FDA, we developed S.T.E.P.S.(R), or "SYSTEM FOR THALIDOMIDE EDUCATION AND PRESCRIBING SAFETY," which is a proprietary strategic comprehensive education and risk-management distribution program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate use of THALOMID(R).  On January 9, 2006, we announced that an external Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, analysis of a Phase III pivotal trial (MM-003), which is a multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study comparing thalidomide plus dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone as induction therapy for previously untreated multiple myeloma, determined that the trial met the pre-established efficacy-stopping rule for the primary endpoint of time to disease progression. The IDMC found a statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression in patients receiving thalidomide plus dexamethasone versus patients receiving dexamethasone alone. As a result of these findings, the trials were unblinded to give patients currently not on THALOMID(R) the opportunity to add THALOMID(R) to their dexamethasone regimen. Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease, and it is the second most common blood cancer, affecting approximately 50,000 people in the United States. About 14,000 new cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed each year and there are an estimated 12,000 deaths per year in the United States.  ALKERAN(R): In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R) (melphalan) in all dosage forms in the United States under the Celgene label. ALKERAN(R) is approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and of carcinoma of the ovary. ALKERAN(R) use in combination with other therapies for the treatment of hematological diseases continues to grow, driven by clinical data reported at major medical conferences around the world. Under the terms of the agreement, we purchase ALKERAN(R) tablets and ALKERAN(R) for injection from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under the Celgene label. The agreement has been extended through March 31, 2009.  RITALIN(R) FAMILY OF DRUGS: We developed FOCALIN(TM), which is formulated by isolating the active d-isomer of methylphenidate using advanced single-isomer chemistry technology. Isomers are any of two or more chemical substances that are composed of the same elements in the same proportions but can differ in properties because of differences in the arrangement of atoms. FOCALIN(TM) provides favorable                                         3 tolerability and dosing flexibility at half the dose of RITALIN(R). In April 2000, we licensed to Novartis the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) to FOCALIN(TM) and FOCALIN XR(TM), the extended release version, in exchange for milestone payments, a FOCALIN(TM) product supply agreement (whereby we supply FOCALIN(TM) exclusively to Novartis) and royalties on FOCALIN XR(TM) and the entire RITALIN(R) family of drugs including RITALIN(R), RITALIN LA(R) and RITALIN SR(R). We have retained the exclusive commercial rights to FOCALIN(TM) and FOCALIN XR(TM) for oncology-related disorders, such as chronic fatigue associated with chemotherapy. On November 15, 2001, FOCALIN(TM) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, in children and adolescents. On May 27, 2005, FOCALIN XR(TM) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD in adults, adolescents and children.  PRECLINICAL-AND CLINICAL-STAGE PIPELINE:  Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline of new drug candidates, in addition to our cell therapies, is highlighted by multiple classes of small molecule, orally administered therapeutic agents designed to selectively regulate disease-associated genes and proteins. The drug candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. Successful results in preclinical or Phase I/II clinical studies may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of a drug candidate.           o    PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS          If the FDA allows a request to initiate clinical investigations of a          new drug candidate to become effective, Phase I human clinical trials          can begin. These tests usually involve between 20 and 80 healthy          volunteers or patients. The tests study a drug's safety profile, and          may include preliminary determination of a drug candidate's safe dosage          range. The Phase I clinical studies also determine how a drug is          absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and the          duration of its action.           o    PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS          In Phase II clinical trials, controlled studies are conducted on a          limited number of patients with the targeted disease. An initial          evaluation of the drug's effectiveness on patients is performed and          additional information on the drug's safety and dosage range is          obtained.           o    PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS          This phase typically includes controlled multi-center trials and          involves a larger target patient population to ensure that study          results are statistically significant. During the Phase III clinical          trials, physicians monitor patients to determine efficacy and to gather          further information on safety.  IMiDs(R): IMiDs(R) compounds are proprietary novel small molecule, orally available compounds that modulate the immune system and other biologically important targets through multiple mechanisms of action. We have advanced four IMiDs(R) compounds into development: REVLIMID(R) (CC-5013), CC-4047 and CC-11006 are being evaluated in human clinical trials and CC-10015 is advancing toward potential clinical testing.  Our IMiDs(R) compounds are covered by an extensive and comprehensive intellectual property estate of U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications including composition-of-matter, use and other patents and patent applications.  CC-4047: is one of the most potent IMiDs(R) compounds that we are developing. We are planning Phase II trials to determine CC-4047 potential safety and efficacy as an orally available treatment for sickle cell                                         4 anemia, myelofibrosis and prostate cancer. CC-4047 and REVLIMID(R) have different activity profiles which may lead to their evaluation in different diseases or stages of disease.  CC-11006: is a molecule we have identified as a potential treatment for hematological malignances and chronic inflammatory diseases, many of which have unmet medical needs. CC-11006 entered Phase I human clinical trials in 2004. Following the completion of additional preclinical and Phase I trials, we will evaluate our development options.  ANTI-INFLAMMATORY: Our anti-inflammatory program potentially provides an oral approach for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. CC-10004 - our lead investigational drug in this class of anti-inflammatory compounds - a novel orally available small molecule - that inhibits the production of multiple proinflammatory mediators including PDE-4, TNF-alpha, interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, leukotrienes, and nitric oxide synthase. CC-10004 is being studied in Phase II proof of principle clinical trials for chronic inflammatory diseases. Based on promising results from our psoriasis proof-of-principle studies, Celgene is advancing the clinical development of CC-10004 in moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. Early stage studies in healthy human volunteers found CC-10004 to be safe and well tolerated with good bioavailability and pharmacokenetics.  BENZOPYRANS: CC-8490, our lead investigational compound in this category, is in Phase I clinical trials for glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer. Based on findings from this study, we will evaluate whether to advance a second compound, CC-113, which has broad anti-tumor activity and which is currently in pre-clinical development.  KINASE INHIBITORS: At Celgene Research San Diego, we have multiple target and drug discovery projects underway in the field of kinase inhibition. Kinases are molecules used by cells to regulate gene expression and protein production. Our kinase inhibitor platform includes inhibitors of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or JNK, pathway and inhibitors of the NFkB pathway. Both pathways have been associated with the regulation of a number of important disease indications. In the case of JNK, CC-401 our lead JNK inhibitor, successfully completed a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers. We are currently evaluating the clinical potential of CC-401 in acute myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer, in a phase II clinical trial. Two other JNK compounds, CC-359 and CC-930 are in pre-clinical development advancing toward clinical testing.  LIGASE INHIBITORS: In addition, at Celgene Research San Diego, we are conducting extensive discovery research in the field of ligases, intracellular protein complexes that control the function and degradation of a wide variety of proteins within cells. We are identifying drug targets and compounds that regulate ligase pathways with the goal of controlling cellular proliferation and survival. Such compounds have the potential to be an important new class of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory therpeutics.  STEM CELLS AND BIOMATERIALS: Stem cell based therapies offer the potential to provide disease-modifying outcomes for serious diseases which today lack adequate therapy. At CCT, we are researching stem cells derived from the human placenta and umbilical cord. Our studies of placental stem cells over the past two years have uncovered biological activities with therapeutic promise. In December 2004, we filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA for our initial stem cell trial in sickle cell anemia. In sickle cell anemia, our research has shown that our IMiDs(R) compounds can interact with stem cells and modulate them in such a way that they differentiate into erythrocytes, or red blood cells. We have also discovered a method of expanding the stem cell population in cord blood, to help generate the increased number and type of stem cells that may be necessary for treating patients with cancer and other indications in the future.                                         5 CCT has developed proprietary methods for producing placental biomaterials for organ and tissue repair that include products such as BIOVANCE(TM). In addition, CCT has developed proprietary technology for collecting, processing and storing placental stem cells with potentially broad therapeutic applications in cancer, autoimmune, cardiovascular, neurological and other diseases.

It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions, and also to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.  We own or have exclusively licensed more than 128 U.S. patents and 100 additional U.S. patent applications. Our U.S. patents include patents for a method of delivering a teratogenic drug to a patient while preventing fetal exposure as well as patents for delivering drugs to patients while restricting access to the drug to those for whom the drug is contra-indicated. We also have patent applications pending which are directed to these inventions, and are seeking worldwide protection. While we have a policy to seek worldwide patent protection for our inventions, we have foreign patent rights corresponding to most but not all of our U.S. patents. Further, although THALOMID(R) is approved for use associated with ENL, we do not have patent protection relating to the use of THALOMID(R) to treat ENL.  Our research at Celgene Research San Diego has led us to seek patent protection for molecular targets and drug discovery technologies, as well as therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. More specifically, proprietary technology has been developed for use in molecular target discovery, the identification of regulatory pathways in cells, assay design and the discovery and development of pharmaceutical product candidates. As of December 2005, included in those inventions described above, our San Diego subsidiary owned, in whole or in part, over 32 issued U.S. patents and approximately 47 U.S. patent applications. An increasing percentage of our San Diego subsidiary's recent patent applications have been related to potential product candidates or compounds. It also holds licenses to U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications, some of which are licensed exclusively or sub-licensed to third parties in connection with sponsored or collaborative research relationships.  CCT, our cellular therapeutics subsidiary (legally known as Anthrogenesis Corp.), seeks patent protection for the collection, processing and uses of mammalian placental tissue and placental stem cells, as well as cells and biomaterials derived from the placenta. As of December 2005, CCT owned, in whole or in part, more than 28 U.S. patent applications including pending provisional applications, and holds licenses to                                         8 U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications, including certain patents and patent applications related to cord blood collection and storage.  In August 2001, we entered into an agreement, termed the New Thalidomide Agreement, with EntreMed, Inc., Children's Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC, and Bioventure Investments, KFT relating to patents and patent applications owned by CMCC, which agreement superceded several agreements already in place between CMCC, EntreMed and us. Pursuant to the New Thalidomide Agreement, CMCC directly granted to us an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license under the relevant patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide. Several U.S. patents have been issued to CMCC in this patent family and certain of these patents expire in 2014. Corresponding foreign patent applications and additional U.S. patent applications are still pending.  In addition to the New Thalidomide Agreement, we entered into an agreement, entitled the New Analog Agreement, with CMCC and EntreMed in December 2002, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain CMCC patents and patent applications relating to thalidomide analogs, or the New Analog Agreement. The New Analog Agreement was executed in connection with the settlement of certain pending litigation by and among us, EntreMed and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating to the allowance of certain CMCC patent applications covering thalidomide analogs. These patent applications had been licensed exclusively to EntreMed in the field of thalidomide analogs. In conjunction with the settlement of these suits, we acquired equity securities in EntreMed, and EntreMed terminated its license agreements with CMCC relating to thalidomide analogs. In turn, under the New Analog Agreement, CMCC exclusively licensed to Celgene these patents and patent applications, which relate to analogs, metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide, and stereoisomers thereof. Under the New Analog Agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain milestones and royalties, including those for REVLIMID(R) approval and sales.  The New Analog Agreement grants us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed thalidomide analog patent rights. The New Analog Agreement also grants us an option to inventions in the field of thalidomide analogs that may be developed at CMCC in the laboratory of Dr. Robert D'Amato, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separate Sponsored Research Agreement negotiated between CMCC and us.  Under an agreement with The Rockefeller University, pursuant to which we have made a lump sum payment and issued stock options to The Rockefeller University and certain inventors, we have obtained certain exclusive rights and licenses to manufacture, have manufactured, use, offer for sale and sell products that are based on compounds which were identified in research carried out by The Rockefeller University and us that have activity associated with TNF(alpha). In particular, The Rockefeller University identified a method of using thalidomide and certain thalidomide-like compounds to treat certain symptoms associated with abnormal concentrations of TNF(alpha), including those manifested in septic shock, cachexia and HIV infection. In 1995, The Rockefeller University was issued a U.S. patent which claims such methods. This U.S. patent expires in 2012 and is included in the patent rights exclusively licensed to us under the agreement with The Rockefeller University. The Rockefeller University did not seek corresponding patents in any other country.  Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties where necessary and conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including ours, can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage sought in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by third-                                         9 party patent rights, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they will be circumvented or infringed upon by others.  Consequently, we do not know whether any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications, which have not already been allowed, will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by third-party patent rights, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage or whether they will be circumvented or infringed by others. Finally, we cannot guarantee that our patents or pending applications will not be involved in, or be defeated as a result of, any interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  With respect to patents and patent applications we have licensed-in, there can be no assurance that additional patents will be issued to any of the third parties from whom we have licensed patent rights, either with respect to thalidomide or thalidomide analogs, or that, if any new patents are issued, such patents will not be dominated by third-party patent rights or provide us with significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of the existing licensed patents will provide us with proprietary protection or commercial advantage. Nor can we guarantee that these licensed patents will not be either infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others, or that the relevant agreements will not be terminated. Any termination of the licenses granted to Celgene by CMCC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Since patent applications filed in the United States on or before November 28, 2000 are maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, or our licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each of the issued patents or pending patent applications or that we, or our licensors, were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. In the event a third party has also filed a patent for any of our inventions, we, or our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in the loss of a U.S. patent or loss of any opportunity to secure U.S. patent protection for the invention. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us.  We are aware of U.S. patents that have been issued to third parties claiming subject matter relating to the NFeB pathway, which could overlap with technology claimed in some of our owned or licensed NFeB patents or patent applications. We believe that one or more interference proceedings have been initiated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention for this subject matter. While we cannot predict the outcome of any such proceedings, in the event we do not prevail, we believe that we can use alternative methods for our NFeB drug discovery program for which we have issued U.S. patents that are not claimed by the subject matter of the third-party patents. We are also aware of third-party U.S patents that relate to the use of certain TNF(alpha) inhibitors to treat inflammation or conditions such as asthma.  We may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing patents or we may be required to obtain licenses to such patents. However, we do not know whether such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Prosecution of patent applications and litigation to establish the validity and scope of patents, to assert patent infringement claims against others and to defend against patent infringement claims by others can be expensive and time-consuming. There can be no assurance that, in the event that claims of any of our owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third parties, any court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that such patent claims are valid and enforceable. An adverse outcome in such litigation could cause us to lose exclusivity relating to the subject matter delineated by such patent claims and may have a material adverse effect on our                                         10 business. If a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease using the products or processes covered by the disputed rights, subject to significant liabilities to such third party and/or be required to license technologies from such third party. Also, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country. Competitors may choose to file oppositions to patent applications, which have been deemed allowable by foreign patent examiners. Furthermore, even if our owned or licensed patents are determined to be valid and enforceable, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. Additionally, for these same reasons, we cannot be sure that patents of a broader scope than ours may be issued and thereby create freedom to operate issues. If this occurs we may need to reevaluate pursuing such technology, which is dominated by others' patent rights, or alternatively, seek a license to practice our own invention, whether or not patented.  We also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. There can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technological advances will not otherwise become known to others. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite precautions taken by us, others have not and will not obtain access to our proprietary technology or that such technology will not be found to be non-proprietary or not a trade secret.  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION  Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and development activities. Most, if not all, of our therapeutic products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States, various federal and in some cases state statutes and regulations also govern or impact upon the manufacturing, testing for safety and effectiveness, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of such products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure by us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees to obtain or maintain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit sharing payments.  The activities required before a pharmaceutical may be marketed in the United States begin with preclinical testing not involving human subjects. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate's chemistry and its biological activities and the conduct of animal studies to assess the                                         11 potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate and its formulations. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must be reviewed by the FDA primarily for safety considerations before proposed clinical trials in humans can begin.  Typically, clinical trials involve a three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are generally conducted with a small number of individuals, usually healthy human volunteers, to determine the early safety and tolerability profile and the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. If the Phase I trials are satisfactory, Phase II clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients in order to determine preliminary efficacy, dosing regimes and expanded evidence of safety. In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, adequately powered and typically placebo-controlled comparative clinical trials are conducted with patients in an effort to provide enough data for the statistical proof of efficacy and safety required by the FDA and others for marketing approval. In some limited circumstances, Phase III clinical trials may be modified to allow the evaluation of safety and efficacy based upon (i) comparisons with approved drugs, (ii) comparison with the historical progression of the disease in untreated patients, or (iii) the use of surrogate markers, together with a commitment for post-approval studies. In some cases, as a condition for New Drug Application, or NDA, approval, further studies (Phase IV) are required to provide additional information concerning the drug. The FDA requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials, and reports of all adverse events must be made to the agency before drug approval. After drug approval, the Company has ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the drug, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events. Additionally, we may have limited control over studies conducted with our proprietary compounds if such studies are performed by others, (e.g., cooperative groups and the like).  The results of the preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for evaluation to determine if the product is sufficiently safe and effective for approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. When an NDA is approved, the NDA holder must a) employ a system for obtaining reports of experience and side effects associated with the drug and make appropriate submissions to the FDA and b) timely advise the FDA if any marketed drug fails to adhere to specifications established by the NDA internal manufacturing procedures.  Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, a sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug intended to treat a "rare disease or condition" as an "orphan drug." A rare disease or condition is defined as one which affects less than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects more than 200,000 people, but for which the cost of developing and making available the drug is not expected to be recovered from sales of the drug in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA for a drug designated as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA is entitled to exclusive marketing rights in the United States for such drug for that indication for seven years unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of persons with the disease. This period of exclusivity is concurrent with any patent exclusivity that relates to the drug. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with the drug's development. Possible amendment of the Orphan Drug Act by the U.S. Congress and possible reinterpretation by the FDA has been discussed by regulators and legislators. FDA regulations reflecting certain definitions, limitations and procedures for orphan drugs initially went into effect in January 1993 and were amended in certain respects in 1998. Therefore, there is no assurance as to the precise scope of protection that may be afforded by orphan drug status in the future or that the current level of exclusivity and tax credits will remain in effect. Moreover, even if we have an orphan drug designation for a particular use of a drug, there can be no assurance that another company also holding orphan drug designation will not receive approval prior to us for the same indication. If that were to happen, our applications for that indication could not be approved until the                                         12 competing company's seven-year period of exclusivity expired. Even if we are the first to obtain approval for the orphan drug indication, there are certain circumstances under which a competing product may be approved for the same indication during our seven-year period of exclusivity. First, particularly in the case of large molecule drugs, a question can be raised whether the competing product is really the "same drug" as that which was approved. In addition, even in cases in which two products appear to be the same drug, the agency may approve the second product based on a showing of clinical superiority compared to the first product.  Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer's quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP (cGMP are regulations established by the FDA that govern the manufacture, processing, packing, storage and testing of drugs intended for human use). In complying with cGMP, manufacturers must devote extensive time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control and quality assurance to maintain full technical compliance. Manufacturing facilities and company records are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with these requirements, regulatory enforcement action may be taken by the FDA, which may include seeking an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and recall of products previously shipped from the facility.  Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions such as warning letters, recalls or adverse publicity issued by the FDA or in legal actions such as seizures, injunctions, fines based on the equitable remedy of disgorgement, restitution and criminal prosecution.  Approval procedures similar to those in the United States must be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the market for our products before any such product can be commercialized in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. There can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of drug pricing is required in most countries other than the United States. There can be no assurance that the resulting pricing of our drugs would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.  COMPETITION  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in which we compete are each highly competitive. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have considerably greater financial, scientific, technical and marketing resources than us. We also experience competition in the development of our products and processes from universities and other research institutions and, in some instances, compete with others in acquiring technology from such sources.  Competition in the pharmaceutical industry, and specifically in the oncology and immune-inflammatory areas being addressed by us, is particularly intense. Numerous pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic companies have extensive anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug discovery, development and commercial resources. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Amgen Inc., Genentech, Inc., Sanofi-Aventis SA., Novartis AG, AstraZeneca PLC., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SuperGen, Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Merck and Co., Inc. and Pfizer Inc. are among some of the companies researching and developing new compounds in the oncology and immunology fields.  The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have undergone, and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change. Also, consolidation and competition are expected to intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved and become more widely known. In order to                                         13 compete effectively, we will be required to continually upgrade and expand our scientific expertise and technology, identify and retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and commercially viable opportunities.  Our competition will be determined in part by the indications and geographic markets for which our products are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. An important factor in competition will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors' products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of products to the market are expected to be important competitive factors. Competition among products approved for sale will be based, among other things, on product efficacy, safety, convenience, reliability, availability, price, third-party reimbursement and patent and non-patent exclusivity.  SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES  From time to time we enter into strategic alliances with third parties whereby we either grant rights to certain of our compounds in exchange for rights to receive payments, or acquire rights to compounds owned by other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies in exchange for obligations to make payments to the partnering companies in the form of upfront payments, milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined criteria and/or research and development funding. Under these arrangements, one of the parties may also purchase product and pay royalties on product sales. The following are our most significant alliances:       NOVARTIS: In April 2000, we entered into an agreement with Novartis in      which we granted to Novartis an exclusive worldwide license (excluding      Canada) to further develop and market FOCALIN(TM) (d-methylphenidate, or d-      MPH) and FOCALIN XR(TM), the long-acting drug formulation. We have retained      the exclusive commercial rights to FOCALIN(TM) and FOCALIN XR(TM) for      oncology-related disorders, such as chronic fatigue associated with      chemotherapy. We also granted Novartis rights to all of our related      intellectual property and patents, including new formulations of the      currently marketed RITALIN(R). Under the agreement, we have received      upfront and regulatory achievement milestone payments totaling $55.0      million and are entitled to additional payments upon attainment of certain      other milestone events. We also sell FOCALIN(TM) to Novartis as well as      receive royalties on all of Novartis' FOCALIN XR(TM) and RITALIN(R) family      of ADHD-related products. The research portion of the agreement terminated      in June 2003.       PHARMION: In November 2001, we licensed to Pharmion Corporation exclusive      rights relating to the development and commercial use of our intellectual      property covering thalidomide and S.T.E.P.S(R). Under the terms of the      agreement, as amended in December 2004, we receive a royalty of 8% of      Pharmion's net thalidomide sales in countries where Pharmion has received      regulatory approval and a S.T.E.P.S(R) license fee of 8% in all other      licensed territories. Separately in December 2004, following our      acquisition of Penn T Limited, our wholly-owned subsidiary Celgene UK      Manufacturing II Limited, or CUK II, entered into an amended thalidomide      supply agreement with Pharmion whereby in exchange for a reduction in      Pharmion's purchase price of thalidomide to 15.5% of its net sales of      thalidomide, we received a one-time payment of $77.0 million. Pursuant to      another December 2004 agreement, we also received a one-time payment of      $3.0 million in return for granting license rights to Pharmion to develop      and market thalidomide in additional territories and eliminating certain of      our license termination rights. Under the agreements, as amended, the      territory licensed to Pharmion is for all countries other than the United      States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and all provinces of China other than Hong      Kong. The agreements with Pharmion terminate upon the ten-year anniversary      following receipt of the first regulatory approval for thalidomide in the      United Kingdom.                                         14 To support the further clinical development of thalidomide, Pharmion has      also provided research funding under various agreements of approximately      $10.7 million through December 31, 2005 and is required to fund an      additional $2.7 million in each of 2006 and 2007.       On December 31, 2005, we held 1,939,600 shares of Pharmion common stock      received in connection with the conversion of a five-year Senior      Convertible Promissory Note purchased in April 2003 under a Securities      Purchase Agreement with Pharmion and the exercise of warrants received in      connection with the November 2001 thalidomide license and April 2003      Securities Purchase Agreement.       GLAXOSMITHKLINE: In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution      agreement with GSK to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R) (melphalan),      a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple      myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under the terms of the agreement, we      purchase ALKERAN(R) tablets and ALKERAN(R) for infusion from GSK and      distribute the products in the United States under the Celgene label. The      agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum quantities each year      under a take-or-pay arrangement. The agreement has been extended through      March 31, 2009. On December 31, 2005, the remaining minimum purchase      requirements under the agreement totaled $102.0 million, consisting of      $13.7 million from the initial agreement and the following subsequent      extensions:                    o    April 1, 2006   - December 31, 2006         $21,000,000                   o    January 1, 2007 - December 31, 2007         $29,050,000                   o    January 1, 2008 - December 31, 2008         $30,525,000                   o    January 1, 2009 - March 31, 2009            $ 7,725,000  MANUFACTURING  Currently, we do not manufacture any of our products on a commercial scale. We have contracted with third-party manufacturers to supply the raw materials and finished products to meet our needs and, while a site has been purchased in Neuchatel, Switzerland, where we are constructing a drug product manufacturing facility, we intend to continue to utilize outside manufacturers as needed to produce certain of our products on a commercial scale. Our third-party manufacturers meet the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations and guidelines. cGMP regulations requires that all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve and maintain compliance with regulations governing the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storing and testing of drugs intended for human use.  The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for THALOMID(R) is manufactured by Eagle Picher Pharmaceutical Services, a Division of Eagle-Picher Incorporated, which has filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We currently have adequate supplies of API for THALOMID(R) on hand to support our projected long-term requirements and do not believe that the Eagle-Picher Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing will result in any supply disruptions for the foreseeable future. In addition, a second supplier is currently being qualified. We rely on two drug product manufacturers, Penn Pharmaceuticals Services Limited and Institute of Drug Technology Australia Limited for the formulation and encapsulation of the finished dosage form of THALOMID(R) capsules, and on one contract packager, Sharp Corporation, for the packaging of the final product.  The API for REVLIMID(R) is manufactured by Evotec OAI, Ltd. We have contracted with OSG Norwich Pharmaceuticals and Penn Pharmaceuticals Services Ltd. for the manufacture of REVLIMID(R) finished product.                                         15 The API for FOCALIN(TM) is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc. and Seigfried USA, Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer, Mikart, Inc., for the tableting and packaging of FOCALIN(TM) finished product. We obtain the API for FOCALIN XR(TM) from Johnson Matthey Inc., on behalf of Novartis for the manufacture of FOCALIN XR(TM) finished product.  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  We have established our international headquarters in Neuchatel, Switzerland where, among other things, we are constructing a facility to perform formulation, encapsulation, packaging, warehousing and distribution of future products. We are also in the process of establishing our international regulatory, clinical and commercial infrastructure, which includes the hiring of our management team for international operations and establishing legal entities beginning in Europe and throughout the world.  We also have a strategic alliance with Pharmion Corporation to expand the THALOMID(R) franchise in all countries other than the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and all provinces of China other than Hong Kong. The strategic partnership combines Pharmion's global development and marketing expertise and our intellectual property. The alliance is designed to accelerate the establishment of THALOMID(R) as an important therapy in the international markets. To date, Pharmion has received regulatory approval in Australia, New Zealand, Turkey and Israel to market and distribute Thalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma after the failure of standard therapies, as well as for the treatment of complications of leprosy. In October 2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, a worldwide supplier of THALOMID(R). Through manufacturing agreements entered into with a third party in connection with this acquisition, we are able to control manufacturing for THALOMID(R) worldwide and we also increased our participation in the potential sales growth of THALOMID(R) in key international markets.  SALES AND COMMERCIALIZATION  We have a 234-person (including CCT) U.S. pharmaceutical commercial organization. These individuals have considerable experience in the pharmaceutical industry, and many have experience with oncological and immunological products. We expect to expand our sales and commercialization group to support products we develop to treat oncological and immunological diseases. We intend to market and sell the products we develop for indications with accessible patient populations. For drugs with indications involving larger patient populations, we may partner with other pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we are positioned to accelerate the expansion of these sales and marketing resources as appropriate to take advantage of product in-licensing and product acquisition opportunities.  EMPLOYEES  As of February 1, 2006, we had 944 full-time employees, 531 of who were engaged primarily in research and development activities, 234 (including CCT) who were engaged in sales and commercialization activities and the remainder of who were engaged in executive and general and administrative activities. We also maintain consulting arrangements with a number of researchers at various universities and other research institutions in Europe and the United States.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  Certain statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report are forward-looking statements concerning our business, financial condition, results of operations, economic performance and financial condition. Forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are included, for example, in the discussions about:                                         16 o        our strategy;  o        new product discovery, development or product introduction;  o        product manufacturing  o        product sales, royalties and contract revenues;  o        expenses and net income;  o        our credit risk management;  o        our liquidity;  o        our asset/liability risk management; and  o        our operational and legal risks.  These and other forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  ALTHOUGH WE ARE CURRENTLY PROFITABLE, WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT.  For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we posted net income of $63.7 million, $52.8 million and $25.7 million, respectively. Prior to 2003, we had sustained losses in each year since our incorporation in 1986. In addition, we had an accumulated deficit of $170.8 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $234.4 million at December 31, 2004. We expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products. We also expect that our rate of spending will accelerate as the result of increased clinical trial costs and expenses associated with regulatory approval and commercialization of products now in development and products discovered, licensed or acquired by us in the future.  WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS.  We have historically experienced, and expect to continue for the foreseeable future to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, and may result in volatility of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many factors, including:       o    demand for our products;       o    regulatory approvals for our products;       o    the timing and level of research and development and sales and           marketing, including product launch costs;                                         17 o    the timing and level of reimbursement from third-party payors for our           products;       o    the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products           by us or competing companies;       o    the development or expansion of business infrastructure in new           clinical and geographic markets;       o    the acquisition of new products and companies;       o    tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;       o    the timing and recognition of certain research and development           milestones and license fees; and       o    our ability to control our costs.  IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES.  Many of our products and processes are in the early or mid-stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial financial resources, extensive research, development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. With the exception of REVLIMID(R), THALOMID(R), ALKERAN(R), FOCALIN(TM) and FOCALIN XR(TM) (the extended release version), all of our other product candidates will require further development, clinical testing and regulatory approvals before initial commercial marketing in the United States and internationally. Moreover, REVLIMID(R) requires further preclinical and clinical testing as a condition of approval and all of our commercially available products will require further development, clinical testing and regulatory approvals as we seek approvals in new indications and geographic markets. If it becomes too expensive to sustain our present commitment of resources on a long-term basis, we will be unable to continue certain necessary research and development activities. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our clinical testing will render satisfactory results, or that we will receive required regulatory approvals for our new products or new indications. If any of our products, even if developed and approved, cannot be successfully commercialized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected which could have a negative impact on the value of our common stock or debt securities obligations.  DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, WE WILL BE VERY DEPENDENT ON THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF REVLIMID(R), THALOMID(R), ALKERAN(R), FOCALIN(TM), AND FOCALIN XR(TM).  At our present and anticipated level of operations, we may not be able to maintain profitability without continued growth in our revenues. The growth of our business during the next several years will be largely dependent on the commercial success of REVLIMID(R) and our other products. REVLIMID(R) was approved by the FDA on December 27, 2005 for the treatment of certain myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality. REVLIMID(R) will be distributed through contracted pharmacies under the RevAssist(sm) program, which is a proprietary risk-management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of REVLIMID(R). We do not have long-term data on the use of the product and cannot predict whether REVLIMID(R) will gain widespread acceptance, which will mostly depend on the acceptance of regulators, physicians, patients and other key opinion leaders as a relatively safe and effective drug that has certain advantages as compared to existing                                         18 or future therapies. In addition, some of our products compete with one another as therapies designed to treat cancer. For example, market acceptance of REVLIMID(R) may result to the detriment of THALOMID(R) and ALKERAN(R). We are also seeking to market REVLIMID(R) in Europe as well as for other indications in the United States. A delay in gaining the requisite regulatory approvals could negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock or debt securities obligations.  THALOMID(R) is currently approved as a therapy for the treatment of ENL. However, the market for the use of THALOMID(R) in patients suffering from ENL is relatively small and we are dependent on revenues generated from its off-label use in treating multiple myeloma and other forms of cancer. We have filed an sNDA with the FDA seeking to market THALOMID(R) as a treatment in multiple myeloma and are awaiting FDA action. If THALOMID(R) does not receive market approval, its off-label use in treating multiple myeloma and other forms of cancer may diminish over time. In addition, if adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of THALOMID(R) by patients, this could undermine physician and patient comfort with the product, could limit the commercial success of the product and could even impact the acceptance of our other products, including REVLIMID(R). Also, we are dependent upon sales of ALKERAN(R), which we license from GSK, and royalties based on Novartis' sales of FOCALIN XR(TM), which we cannot directly impact.  Our revenues and profits would be negatively impacted if generic versions of any of these products were to be approved and launched.  WE FACE THE RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.  We may be subject to a variety of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our technology or products has resulted in adverse effects, whether by participants in our clinical trials, by patients using our products or by other persons exposed to our products. Thalidomide, when used by pregnant women, has resulted in serious birth defects. Therefore, necessary and strict precautions must be taken by physicians prescribing the drug and pharmacies dispensing the drug to women with childbearing potential. These precautions may not be observed in all cases or, if observed, may not be effective. Use of thalidomide has also been associated, in a limited number of cases, with other side effects, including nerve damage. Although we have product liability insurance that we believe is sufficient, we may be unable to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms if required, or our coverage may be inadequate to protect us in the event of a multitude of claims being asserted against us. Our obligation to defend against or pay any product liability or other claim may be expensive and divert the efforts of our management and technical personnel.  IF OUR PRODUCTS ARE NOT ACCEPTED BY THE MARKET, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WILL DETERIORATE OR NOT MATERIALIZE AT ALL.  It is necessary that our and our distribution partners' products, including REVLIMID(R), THALOMID(R), ALKERAN(R), FOCALIN(TM) and FOCALIN XR(TM), and the RITALIN(R) family of drugs achieve and maintain market acceptance. A number of factors can render the degree of market acceptance of our products uncertain, including the products' efficacy, safety and advantages, if any, over competing products, as well as the reimbursement policies of third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. In particular, thalidomide, when used by pregnant women, has resulted in serious birth defects, and the negative history associated with thalidomide and birth defects may decrease the market acceptance of THALOMID(R). In addition, the products that we are attempting to develop through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional drugs and therapies which are now, or may be in the future, manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public attitudes may be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe, and stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public                                         19 or the medical community. If our products are not accepted by the market, demand for our products will deteriorate or not materialize at all.  WE HAVE NO COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND IF THE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS UPON WHOM WE RELY FAIL TO PRODUCE ON A TIMELY BASIS THE RAW MATERIALS OR FINISHED PRODUCTS IN THE VOLUMES THAT WE REQUIRE OR FAIL TO MEET QUALITY STANDARDS AND MAINTAIN NECESSARY LICENSURE FROM REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN LOST REVENUES.  We do not currently manufacture any of our products on a commercial scale and have contracted with third-party manufacturers to supply the raw materials and finished products to meet our needs. Although a site has been purchased in Neuchatel, Switzerland, and we are constructing a drug product manufacturing facility, we cannot utilize this facility to manufacture our marketed products until we obtain necessary FDA clearance. Additionally, we intend to continue to utilize outside manufacturers as needed to produce certain of our products on a commercial scale.  The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for THALOMID(R) is manufactured by Eagle Picher Pharmaceutical Services, a Division of Eagle-Picher Incorporated, which has filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We currently have adequate supplies of API for THALOMID(R) on hand to support our projected long-term requirements and do not believe that the Eagle-Picher Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing will result in any supply disruptions for the foreseeable future. In addition, a second supplier is currently being qualified. We rely on two drug product manufacturers, Penn Pharmaceuticals Services Limited and Institute of Drug Technology Australia Limited for the formulation and encapsulation of the finished dosage form of THALOMID(R) capsules, and on one contract packager, Sharp Corporation, for the packaging of the final product.  The API for FOCALIN(TM) is currently obtained from two suppliers, Johnson Matthey Inc. and Seigfried USA, Inc., and we rely on a single manufacturer, Mikart, Inc., for the tableting and packaging of FOCALIN(TM) finished product. We obtain the API for FOCALIN XR(TM) from Johnson Matthey Inc., on behalf of Novartis for the manufacture of FOCALIN XR(TM) finished product.  We have entered into an agreement with Evotec OAI Limited for the supply of REVLIMID(R) API, and have contracted with OSG Norwich Pharmaceuticals and Penn Pharmaceuticals Services Limited for the manufacture of REVLIMID(R) finished product.  In all the countries where we sell our products, governmental regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing, packaging and labeling and storing. All of our suppliers of raw materials and contract manufacturers must comply with these regulations. Failure to do so could result in supply interruptions. In the United States, the FDA requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States achieve and maintain compliance with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations and guidelines. Failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In addition, before any product batch produced by our manufacturers can be shipped, it must conform to release specifications pre-approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical product. If the operations of one or more of our manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason, any required FDA review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products. If our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality, quantity or timeliness, or do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, demand for our products or our ability to continue supplying such products could substantially decline.                                         20 WE HAVE LIMITED MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES.  Although we have a 234-person (including CCT) U.S. pharmaceutical commercial organization to support our products, we may be required to seek one or more corporate partners to provide marketing services with respect to certain of our products. Any delay in securing these resources could substantially delay or curtail the marketing of these products. We have contracted with Ivers Lee Corporation, d/b/a Sharp, a specialty distributor, to distribute THALOMID(R) and REVLIMID(R). If Sharp does not perform its obligations, our ability to distribute THALOMID(R) and REVLIMID(R) may be severely restricted.  WE RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM COLLABORATIONS AND MAY BE DEPENDENT ON COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSES WITH THIRD PARTIES.  Our ability to fully commercialize our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline, if developed, may depend to some extent upon our entering into collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies with the requisite experience and financial and other resources to obtain regulatory approvals and to manufacture and market such products. Our collaborations and licenses include an exclusive license (excluding Canada) to Novartis for the development and commercialization of FOCALIN(TM) and FOCALIN XR(TM); an agreement with Pharmion Corporation to expand the THALOMID(R) franchise internationally; and an agreement with GSK enabling us to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R). Our present and future arrangements may be jeopardized if any or all of the following occur:       o    we are not able to enter into additional joint ventures or other           arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all;       o    our joint ventures or other arrangements do not result in a compatible           working relationship;       o    our partners change their business priorities, fail to perform as           agreed upon or experience financial difficulties that disrupt           necessary business operations;       o    our joint ventures or other arrangements do not lead to the successful           development and commercialization of any products;       o    we are unable to obtain or maintain proprietary rights or licenses to           technology or products developed in connection with our joint ventures           or other arrangements; or       o    we are unable to preserve the confidentiality of any proprietary           rights or information developed in connection with our joint ventures           or other arrangements.  WE MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES BUSINESSES OR PRODUCTS AND THESE ACQUISITIONS INTRODUCE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND PRODUCTS AND TO ACHIEVING BENEFITS FROM THE ACQUISITIONS.  To take advantage of external growth opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner; (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions; (3) the risk that the technologies acquired do not evolve as anticipated; (4) contracts, agreements, assets and liabilities are not as represented; (5) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; (6) the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our other operations; (7) the risks of                                         21 entering new markets in which we have limited experience; (8) difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses; (9) future impairments of goodwill and other intangibles of an acquired business; and, (10) the impact that possible in-process research and development charges may have on future earnings.  Many acquisition candidates in the biopharmaceuticals industry carry high price to earnings valuations. As a result, acquiring a business that has a high valuation may be dilutive to our earnings, especially when the acquired business has little or no revenue.  Key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change-in-control agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity-based compensation rights. To retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we may offer additional, sometimes costly, retention incentives.  THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WE USE IN OUR RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES WHICH COULD EXCEED OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  We use certain hazardous materials in our research, development and general business activities. While we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use of these materials, we cannot be certain that accidental injury or contamination will not occur. Any such accident or contamination could result in substantial liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage.  THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION WHICH PRESENTS NUMEROUS RISKS TO US.  The discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities and agencies in the United States and other countries. If we or our contractors and collaborators are delayed in receiving, or are unable to obtain at all, necessary governmental approvals, we will be unable to effectively market our products.  The testing, marketing and manufacturing of our products require regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA and, in some cases, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, or governmental authorities outside of the United States that perform roles similar to those of the FDA and EPA. Certain of our pharmaceutical products, such as FOCALIN(TM), fall under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 that requires authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, of the U.S. Department of Justice in order to handle and distribute these products. The regulatory approval process presents several risks to us:       o    In general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years,           and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data           obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying           interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;       o    Delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the           regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or other           data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure of the           product to meet, a regulatory agency's requirements for safety,           efficacy and quality or, in the case of a product seeking an orphan           drug indication, because another designee received approval first;                                         22 o    Requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in           regulatory agency policy, or the adoption of new regulations or           legislation;       o    The scope of any regulatory approval, when obtained, may significantly           limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and           reimbursed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of           warnings, precautions and contra-indications that could materially           affect the sales and profitability of the drug;       o    Pricing and reimbursement controls;       o    Approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to           continuing and ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown           problems with these products or the failure to adhere to manufacturing           or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their           manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market;       o    Regulatory authorities and agencies may promulgate additional           regulations restricting the sale of our existing and proposed           products;       o    Once a product receives marketing approval, we may not market that           product for broader or different applications, and the FDA may not           grant us approval with respect to separate product applications that           represent extensions of our basic technology. In addition, the FDA may           withdraw or modify existing approvals in a significant manner or           promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our present           or proposed products;       o    Products, such as REVLIMID(R), that are subject to accelerated           approval can be subject to an expedited withdrawal if the           post-marketing study commitments are not completed with due diligence,           the post-marketing restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be           inadequate to assure the safe use of the drug, or evidence           demonstrates that the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under           its conditions of use. Additionally, promotional materials for such           drugs are subject to enhanced surveillance, including pre-approval           review of all promotional materials used within 120 days following           marketing approval and a requirement for the submissions 30 days prior           to initial dissemination of all promotional materials disseminated           after 120 days following marketing approval.       o    Our labeling and promotional activities relating to our products are           regulated by the FDA and state regulatory agencies and, in some           circumstances, by the DEA, and are subject to associated risks. If we           fail to comply with FDA regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label           uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has           not been obtained, the FDA, or the Office of the Inspector General of           the Department of Health and Human Services or the state Attorneys           General could bring an enforcement action against us that could           inhibit our marketing capabilities as well as result in significant           penalties.  The FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research currently regulates under 21 CFR Parts 1270 and 1271 human tissue intended for transplantation that is recovered, processed, stored or distributed by methods that do not change tissue function or characteristics and that is not currently regulated as a human drug, biological product or medical device. Certain stem cell activities fall within this category. Part 1270 requires tissue establishments to screen and test donors, to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to maintain records. It also provides for inspection by the FDA of tissue establishments. Part 1271 requires human cells, tissue and                                         23 cellular and tissue-based product establishments (HCT/Ps) to register with the agency and list their HCT/Ps.  Currently, we are required to be, and are, licensed to operate in New York and New Jersey, two of the states in which we currently collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses. If other states adopt similar licensing requirements, we would need to obtain such licenses to continue operating. If we are delayed in receiving, or are unable to obtain at all, necessary licenses, we will be unable to provide services in those states and this would impact negatively on our revenues.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO GENERIC COMPETITION.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical firms, including ours, can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.  Under the current U.S. patent laws, patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy from four to eighteen months, and publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries. Thus, we may discover sometime in the future that we, or the third parties from whom we have licensed patents or patent applications, were not the first to make and/or file the inventions covered by the patents and patent applications in which we have or seek rights. In the event that a third party has also filed a patent application for any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications, or those we have licensed-in, we could become involved in an interference proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention or an opposition proceeding in other places such as Europe. Such an interference or opposition could result in the loss of an issued U.S. or foreign patent, respectively, or loss of any opportunity to secure U.S. patent protection for that invention. Even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, such proceedings could result in substantial cost and delay to us and limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.  In addition, the coverage sought in a patent application may not be obtained or may be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, if our pending applications, or pending application that we have licensed-in from third parties, do not result in the issuance of patents or if any patents that are issued do not provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage, our ability to sustain the necessary level of intellectual property rights upon which our success depends may be restricted.  Moreover, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or our licensors, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in other countries may be limited.  Furthermore, even if our patents, or those we have licensed-in, are issued, our competitors may still challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of such patents in court, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation. Alternatively, our competitors may be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. If any of our issued or licensed patents are infringed, we may not be successful in enforcing our or our licensor's intellectual property rights or                                         24 defending the validity or enforceability of our issued patents and subsequently not be able to develop or market applicable product exclusively.  FDA regulatory exclusivity for thalidomide has expired so that generic drug companies can file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to seek approval to market thalidomide in the United States. However, such an ANDA filer will need to challenge the validity or enforceability of our United States patents relating to our S.T.E.P.S.(R) program or to demonstrate that they do not use an infringing risk management program. We cannot predict whether an ANDA challenge to our patents will be made, nor can we predict whether our S.T.E.P.S.(R) patents can be circumscribed or invalidated or otherwise rendered unenforceable. However, if such an ANDA was filed and approved by the FDA, and the generic company was successful in challenging our patents listed in the Orange Book for THALOMID(R), the generic company would be permitted to sell a generic thalidomide product.  Further, we rely upon unpatented proprietary and trade secret technology that we try to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Despite precautions taken by us, others may obtain access to or independently develop our proprietary technology or such technology may be found to be non-proprietary or not a trade secret.  Our right to practice the inventions claimed in certain patents that relate to THALOMID(R) arises under licenses granted to us by others, including The Rockefeller University and Children's Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC. In addition to these patents, which relate to thalidomide, we have also licensed from CMCC certain patents relating to thalidomide analogs. In December 2002, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with CMCC and EntreMed Inc. pursuant to which CMCC exclusively licensed to us certain patents and patent applications that relate to analogs, metabolites, precursors and hydrolysis products of thalidomide, and all stereoisomers thereof. Our license under the December 2002 agreement is worldwide and royalty-bearing, and we have complete control over the prosecution of the licensed thalidomide analog patent rights. Under this December 2002 agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain milestones for a REVLIMID(R) approval and royalties with respect to sales of REVLIMID(R). The December 2002 agreement also grants us an option for a certain time period to inventions in the field of thalidomide analogs that may be developed at CMCC in the laboratory of Dr. Robert D'Amato, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separate Sponsored Research Agreement negotiated between CMCC and us.  Further, while we believe these confidentiality agreements and license agreements to be valid and enforceable, our rights under these agreements may not continue or disputes concerning these agreements may arise. If any of the foregoing should occur, we may be unable to rely upon our unpatented proprietary and trade secret technology, or we may be unable to use the third-party proprietary technology we have licensed-in, either of which may prevent or hamper us from successfully pursuing our business.  On August 19, 2004, we, together with our exclusive licensee Novartis, filed an infringement action in the United States District Court of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., in response to notices of Paragraph IV certifications made by Teva in connection with the filing of an ANDA for FOCALIN(TM). The notification letters contend that United States Patent Nos. 5,908,850, or '850 patent, and 6,355,656, or '656 patent, were invalid. The '656 patent is currently the subject of reexamination proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. After the suit was filed, Novartis listed another patent, United States Patent No. 6,528,530, or '530 patent, in the Orange Book in association with the FOCALIN(TM) NDA. Neither the '656 patent nor the '530 patent is part of the patent infringement action against Teva. This case does not involve an ANDA for RITALIN LA(R) or FOCALIN XR(TM) as such an ANDA has not been filed. Recently, Teva amended its answer to contend that the '850 patent was not                                         25 infringed by the filing of its ANDA, and that the '850 patent is not enforceable due to an allegation of inequitable conduct. Fact discovery expired on February 28, 2006. No trial date has been set. If successful, Teva will be permitted to sell a generic version of FOCALIN(TM), which could significantly reduce our sales of FOCALIN(TM) to Novartis.  It is also possible that third-party patent applications and patents could issue with claims that broadly cover certain aspects of our business or of the subject matter claimed in the patents or patent applications owned or optioned by us or licensed to us, which may limit our ability to conduct our business or to practice under our patents, and may impede our efforts to obtain meaningful patent protection of our own. If patents are issued to third parties that contain competitive or conflicting claims, we may be legally prohibited from pursuing research, development or commercialization of potential products or be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. We may be legally prohibited from using patented technology, may not be able to obtain any license to the patents and technologies of third parties on acceptable terms, if at all, or may not be able to obtain or develop alternative technologies. Consequently, if we cannot successfully defend against any patent infringement suit that may be brought against us by a third-party, we may lose the ability to continue to conduct our business as we presently do, or to practice certain subject matter delineated by patent claims that we have exclusive rights to, whether by ownership or by license, and that may have a material adverse effect on our business.  We rely upon trademarks and service marks to protect our rights to the intellectual property used in our business. On October 29, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Centocor, Inc. to prevent Centocor's use of the term "I.M.I.D.s" in connection with Centocor's products, which use, we believe, is likely to cause confusion with our IMiDs(R) registered trademark for compounds (including REVLIMID(TM)) developed or being developed by us to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases. If we are not successful in this suit, it may be necessary for us to adopt a different trademark for that class of compounds and thereby lose the value we believe we have built in the "IMiDs(R)" mark.  On January 15, 2004, an opposition proceeding was brought by Celltech R&D Ltd. against granted European Patent 0728143 which we have licensed from the University of California relating to JNK 1 and JNK 2 polypeptides. This proceeding is directed solely to our claims for JNK 2 and not JNK 1. An oral hearing occurred in October of 2005 in which the European Patent Office advised us of its intent to revoke certain of our claims. We await a written decision. The written decision may be appealed. We do have other JNK 1 and JNK European patent application claims pending.  THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECH INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.  The pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms, including but not limited to:       o    Amgen, which potentially competes with our TNF(alpha) and kinase           inhibitors;       o    Novartis, which potentially competes with our IMiDs(R) compounds and           kinase programs;       o    Bristol Myers Squibb Co., which potentially competes in clinical           trials with our IMiDs(R) compounds and TNF(alpha) inhibitors;                                         26 o    Genentech, Inc., which potentially competes in clinical trials with           our IMiDs(R) compounds and TNF(alpha) inhibitors;       o    AstraZeneca plc, which potentially competes in clinical trials with           our IMiDs(R) compounds and TNF(alpha) inhibitors;       o    Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., which potentially competes in           clinical trials with our IMiDs(R) compounds as well as with           THALOMID(R);       o    Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Pfizer Inc., which potentially compete           in clinical trials with our kinase inhibitors; and       o    Biogen IDEC Inc. and Genzyme Corporation, both of which are generally           developing drugs that address the oncology and immunology markets.  Many of these companies have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we. We also experience competition from universities and other research institutions, and in some instances, we compete with others in acquiring technology from these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change, and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known. The development of products or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline.  SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DEPENDENT ON THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT.  Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. These health care management organizations and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. If these organizations and third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective or competitive with other available therapies, they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.  WE HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY, AND IF WE FAIL TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE THAT GROWTH OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  We have an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and facilities. We plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks, some of which we cannot control. For example:       o    we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of           operating expenses, and our ability to do so may depend on factors           that we do not control;       o    we will need to assimilate new staff members;       o    we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and           faster growing multinational organization; and                                         27 o   we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we          manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity, and our          ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control.  THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SELL THE COMMON STOCK WHEN YOU WANT OR AT PRICES YOU FIND ATTRACTIVE.  There has been significant volatility in the market prices for publicly traded shares of biopharmaceutical companies, including ours. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. After adjusting prices to reflect our two-for-one stock split effected on February 17, 2006, the intra-day price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $32.68 per share to a low of $12.35 per share in 2005. On December 31, 2005, our common stock closed at a split-adjusted price of $32.40 per share. The price of our common stock may not remain at or exceed current levels. The following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock:       o    results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our           marketed products;       o    announcements of technical or product developments by our competitors;       o    market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks;       o    market conditions generally;       o    governmental regulation;       o    health care legislation;       o    public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of           the disease states that we are targeting;       o    patent or proprietary rights developments;       o    changes in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for our           products; or       o    fluctuations in our operating results.  In addition, the stock market in general and the biotechnology sector in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or debt or other securities convertible into common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2005, after adjusting prices to reflect our two-for-one stock split effected on February 17, 2006, there were outstanding stock options and warrants for 50,999,074 shares of common stock, of which 49,865,160 were currently exercisable at an exercise price range between $0.04 per share and $35.67 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $13.95 per share. In addition, in June 2003, we issued $400.0 million                                         28 of unsecured convertible notes that are currently convertible into 33,022,360 shares of our common stock at the conversion price of $12.1125. The conversion of some or all of these notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.  OUR SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND CERTAIN CHARTER AND BY-LAW PROVISIONS MAY DETER A THIRD-PARTY FROM ACQUIRING US AND MAY IMPEDE THE STOCKHOLDERS' ABILITY TO REMOVE AND REPLACE OUR MANAGEMENT OR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  Our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan, the purpose of which is to protect stockholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer a fair price to all of our stockholders. The rights plan may have the effect of dissuading a potential acquirer from making an offer for our common stock at a price that represents a premium to the then current trading price.  Our board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Additionally, our board of directors has adopted certain amendments to our by-laws intended to strengthen the board's position in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders' ability to remove and replace our management and/or board of directors.  Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer of our common stock.  BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2006, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO EXPENSE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER OUR STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND OUR NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AS A RESULT.  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," or SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123R covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including stock options, restricted stock plans, performance-based awards, stock appreciation rights, and employee stock purchase plans. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123, as originally issued in 1995, established as preferable a fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. However, SFAS No. 123 permitted entities to continue to apply the guidance in APB Opinion No. 25, as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair-value-based method been used. We will be required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Management is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for the pro forma impact on net income and net income per share from calculating stock-based compensation cost under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123. However, the calculation of compensation cost for share-based payment transactions after the effective date of SFAS No. 123R may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under SFAS No. 123.  In December 2005, in recognition of the significance of the REVLIMID(R) regulatory approval, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to grant the 2006 annual stock option awards in 2005 pursuant to the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1998 Plan, and the 1998 Non-Employee Directors' Incentive Plan. All stock options awarded pursuant to the 1998 Plan were granted fully vested, with half issued at an exercise price, or strike price, of $34.05 per option and the other half issued at a strike price of $35.67 per option, which was at a premium to the closing price of $32.43, adjusted for the February 17, 2006 two-for-one stock split, of our common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the grant date of December 29, 2005. The Board's decision to grant these options was in recognition of the REVLIMID(R) regulatory approval and in response to a review of our long-term incentive compensation programs in light of changes in market practices and recently issued changes in accounting rules resulting from the issuance of FASB No. 123R, which we are required to adopt effective the first quarter of 2006. Management believes that granting these options prior to the adoption of FASB No. 123R will result in our not being required to recognize cumulative compensation expense of approximately $70.8 million for the four-year period ending December 31, 2009.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  None.  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES  In November 2004, we purchased approximately 45 acres of land and several buildings located in Summit, New Jersey, at a cost of $25.0 million. The purchase of this site enables us to consolidate our New Jersey locations into one corporate headquarters and provide the space needed to accommodate future expansion. In September 2005, we purchased a site in Neuchatel, Switzerland, for a U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately $3.2 million where we are currently constructing a drug product manufacturing facility, which is scheduled for completion during 2006. We also occupy the following facilities under lease arrangements that have remaining lease terms greater than one-year.                                         29 o    73,500-square feet of laboratory and office space in Warren, New           Jersey. The two leases for this facility have terms ending in May 2007           and July 2010, respectively, and each have two five-year renewal           options. Annual rent for these facilities is approximately $0.8           million.       o    78,202-square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego,           California. The lease for this facility has a term ending in August           2012 with one five-year renewal option. Annual rent for this facility           is approximately $2.0 million and is subject to specified annual           rental increases.       o    20,234-square feet of office and laboratory space in Cedar Knolls, New           Jersey. The leases for this facility have terms ending between           September 2007 and April 2009 with renewal options ranging from either           one or two additional five-year terms. Annual rent for this facility           is approximately $0.3 million and is subject to specified annual           rental increases.       o    11,000-square feet of office and laboratory space in Baton Rouge,           Louisiana. The lease for this facility has a term ending in May 2008           with one three-year renewal option. Annual rent for this facility is           approximately $0.1 million.  Under these lease arrangements, we also are required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. All leases are with unaffiliated parties.  ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are not engaged in any material legal proceedings.  ITEM 4.

As a result of the acquisition of Anthrogenesis on December 31, 2002, we acquired the Anthrogenesis Qualified Employee Incentive Stock Option Plan, or the Qualified Plan, and the Non-Qualified Recruiting and Retention Stock Option Plan, or the Non-Qualified Plan. No future awards will be granted under the Non-Qualified Plan. The Qualified Plan authorizes the award of incentive stock options, which are stock options that qualify for special federal income tax treatment. The exercise price of any stock option granted under the Qualified Plan may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. In general, options granted under the Qualified Plan vest evenly over a four-year period and expire ten years from the date of grant, subject to earlier expiration in case of termination of employment. The vesting period is subject to certain acceleration provisions if a change in control occurs. No award will be granted under the Qualified Plan on or after December 31, 2008.  ITEM 6.
