Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules 94 Signatures 95 Index to Exhibits 97 PART I Item1.Business Ball Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (Ball, we, the company or our) is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured inplants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers within our aerospace and technologies segment. In 2010 our total consolidated net sales were $7.6billion. Our packaging businesses are responsible for 91percent of our net sales, with the remaining 9percent contributed by our aerospace business.
Our largest product lines are aluminum and steel beverage containers, which accounted for 73percent of our 2010 total net sales and 82percent of our 2010 total earnings before interest and taxes. We also produce steel food containers and steel aerosol containers for beverages and foods, as well as steel paint cans, decorative steel tins and aluminum slugs.
We sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. We sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Brazil and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in the U.S. and the PRC.
Our aerospace business is a leader in the design, development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems for civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. It produces spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency systems and components, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions.
We are headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BLL.
Our Strategy Our overall business strategy is to grow our worldwide beverage can business, to leverageourfood and household products packaging business, to grow our aerospace business and to utilizefree cash flow and earnings growth to increaseshareholder value.
We maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through:  Delivering long-term earnings per share growth of 10percent to 15percent per annum  Focusing on free cash flow generation  Increasing Economic Value Added (EVA) The cash generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1)to finance the companys operations, (2)to fund stock buy-back programs and dividend payments, (3)to fund strategic capital investments and (4)to service the companys debt. We will, when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders, make strategic acquisitions or divest parts of our company.
The compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the companys performance through our EVA incentive programs. When the company performs well, our employees are paid more. If the company does not perform well, our employees get paid less or no incentive compensation.
Page 1 of 100 Our Reporting Segments Since June 2010, with the announced sale of the companys plastics packaging, Americas, business, Ball Corporation has had four reportable segments. After aggregating the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segments based on similar economic and qualitative characteristics, the four reportable segments are: (1)metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia; (2)metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3)metal food and household products packaging, Americas; and (4)aerospace and technologies. Ball also has investments in companies in the U.S. and the PRC, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. We previously accounted for our investment in a Brazilian joint venture using the equity method of accounting. However, during August 2010, Ball acquired an additional economic interest in the joint venture and its results since the acquisition date are consolidated and included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment.
Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, production volumes, labor, transportation, utility and warehousing costs, as well as the availability and price of raw materials, such as aluminum, tinplate steel and other direct materials. These raw materials are generally available from several sources, and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages. There has been significant consolidation of raw material suppliers in both North America and in Europe over the past several years. Raw materials and energy sources, such as natural gas and electricity, may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors. We cannot predict the timing or effects, if any, of such occurrences on future operations.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia, Segment Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, is Balls largest segment, accounting for 51percent of consolidated net sales in 2010. Metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages.
Americas In August 2010, the company acquired an additional 10.1percent economic interest in its Brazilian metal beverage packaging joint venture, Latapack-Ball Embalagens Ltda. (Latapack-Ball), through a transaction with the joint venture partner, Latapack S.A. This transaction increased the companys overall economic interest in the joint venture to 60.1percent and resulted in Ball becoming the primary beneficiary of the entity and, consequently, consolidating the joint venture.
Metal beverage containers are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one in Canada and two in Brazil. Can ends are produced within four of the U.S. facilities, including two facilities that manufacture only can ends, and one facility in Brazil. Additionally, Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC, a 50-percent investment owned by Ball and MillerCoors, LLC, operates metal beverage container and can end manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado.
Where growth is projected in certain markets or for certain products, Ball is undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities and may establish or obtain additional manufacturing capacity to the extent required by the growth of any of the markets we serve.In January 2011, we announced that we will close our Torrance, California, plant; relocate a line from the Torrance plant to our Whitby, Ontario, plant and expand specialty can production in our FortWorth, Texas, plant. In February 2011, we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing plant in northeast Brazil, which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country. The new plant will be located in Alagoinhas and is expected to start up in early 2012. The output from the first line has been contracted under a long-term agreement.
According to publicly available information and company estimates, the combined U.S., Canadian and Brazilian metal beverage container markets represent more than 117billion units. Five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the U.S. and Canada and three companies manufacture substantially all such containers in Brazil. Two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in Mexico. Ball produced in excess of 43billion recyclable beverage containers in the U.S., Canada and Brazil in 2010 about 37percent of the aggregate production for those markets. Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September while in Brazil, sales volumes tend to be highest from September through December. All of the beverage cans produced by Ball in the U.S., Canada and Brazil are made of aluminum, as are almost all beverage cans produced by our competitors in those countries. In 2010 we were able to recover substantially all aluminum-related cost increases levied by sheet producers through either financial or contractual means. In the Americas segment, five aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements.
Page 2 of 100 Metal beverage containers are sold based on price, quality, service, innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market, which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by plants that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably. Inaddition, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials. The glass bottle has maintained a meaningful position in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water industries over the past quarter century.
We believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.
Asia The metal beverage container market in the PRC is approximately 15billion containers, of which Balls operations represent an estimated 31percent. Our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the PRC. Eight other manufacturers account for the remainder of the production. Our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in four plants in the PRC, as well as in a joint venture. We also manufacture and sell high-density plastic containers in two PRC plants primarily servicing the motor oil industry.
In June 2010, the company acquired Guangdong Jianlibao Group Co., Ltds 65percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui (Foshan), PRC. Ball had owned 35percent of the joint venture plant since 1992. Ball acquired the 65percent interest for $86.9million in cash (net of cash acquired) and assumed debt, and also entered into a long-term beverage can supply agreement with Jianlibao and one of its affiliates.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe, Segment The European metal beverage container market, excluding Russia, is approximately 51billion containers, and Ball Packaging Europe is the second largest producer with an estimated 32percent of European shipments. While the European market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix, it is showing signs of general improvement and is expected to return to historical growth trends following the impacts of the global economic downturn. In Germany over the past year, two discounters relisted beverage cans on their shelves, continuing the redevelopment of the German beverage can market. During 2010 the company decided not to place into operations a plant in Lublin, Poland, and will instead install the can line originally intended for Lublin in its Belgrade, Serbia, plant.
Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in Europe tend to be highest during the period from May through August with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the United Kingdom. As in North America, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the European beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink, beer, juice and mineral water industries.
The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment, which accounted for 22percent of Balls consolidated net sales in 2010, supplies two-piece metal beverage containers and ends for producers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, mineral water, fruit juices, energy drinks and other beverages. The European operations consist of 12plants 10beverage container plants and two beverage end plants of which four are located in Germany, three in the United Kingdom, two in France and one each in the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia. In addition, Ball Packaging Europe is currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in Haslach, Germany, in order to produce the Ball Resealable End (BRE).
The European plants produced approximately 16billion cans in 2010, with approximately 58percent of those being produced from aluminum and 42percent from steel. Six of the container plants use aluminum and four use steel.
In January 2011, Ball completed the acquisition of Aerocan S.A.S. (Aerocan), a leading European supplier of aluminum aerosol containers, for 222.4million (approximately $300million) in cash and assumed debt. Aerocan manufactures aluminum aerosol containers, and the aluminum slugs used to make them, for customers in the personal care, pharmaceutical, beverage and food industries. It operates three aerosol container manufacturing plants one each in the Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom and is a 51percent owner of a joint venture aluminum slug plant in France. The four plants employ approximately 560 people. The acquisition of Aerocan allows Ball to enter a growing part of the metal packaging industry and to broaden the companys market development efforts into a new customer base.
Page 3 of 100 European raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year, although Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer term agreements. In Europe three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95percent of our requirements. Aluminum is traded primarily in U.S. dollars, while the functional currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are non-U.S. dollars. The company generally tries to minimize the resulting foreign exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies. In addition, purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing arrangements.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas, Segment The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment, accounted for 18percent of consolidated net sales in 2010. Ball produces two-piece and three-piece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood, nutritional products, pet food and other products. The segment also manufactures and sells aerosol, paint and general line containers, as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs. There are a total of 15plants in the U.S. and Canada that produce these products. In addition, the company manufactures and sells aerosol containers in two plants in Argentina.
Sales volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be highest from May through October as a result of seasonal fruit, vegetable and salmon packs. We estimate our 2010 shipments of more than 5billion steel food containers to be approximately 18percent of total U.S. and Canadian metal food container shipments. We estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 49percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel aerosol shipments. We are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs in the U.S. and Canada and estimate our percentage of total industry shipments to be approximately 98percent.
Competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also manufacture steel food containers. Competition in the U.S. steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers. Steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and the stand-up pouch. As a result, profitability for this product line is dependent on price, cost reduction, service and quality. In North America, two steel suppliers provide nearly65percent of our tinplate steel. We believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs. In 2010 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers.
Cost containment is crucial to maintaining profitability in the food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and Ball is focused on doing so. Toward that end, in September 2010, Ball announced the closure of its metal food container manufacturing plant in Richmond, British Columbia; and during 2008 and 2009, Ball closed its aerosol container manufacturing plants in Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California. The two aerosol plant closures resulted in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10production lines, including the relocation of two high-speed aerosol lines to other existing Ball facilities, and allowed us to supply customers from a more consolidated asset base.
Aerospace and Technologies Segment Balls aerospace and technologies segment, which accounted for 9percent of consolidated net sales in 2010, includes national defense hardware; antenna and video component technologies; civil and operational space hardware; and systems engineering services. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other U.S. government agencies. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 96percent of segment sales in 2010.
Geopolitical events, and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segments core capabilities in space hardware. In 2010, we have seen an increase in space hardware orders, our traditional strength, combined with continued growth in opportunities related to our information services and tactical components. Uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding, or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog. The businesses include hardware, software and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space science and exploration, environmental and Earth sciences, and defense and intelligence applications. Major contractual activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations.
Page 4 of 100 Other hardware activities include target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and associated sensor cooling devices; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence, training and space systems needs.
Backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was $989million and $518million at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The increase in backlog is primarily due to the previously announced awards of the WorldView-3 and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) contracts. The 2010backlog includes $521million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2011, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders, which are subject to annual funding, were $620million and $261million at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Year-over-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations.
Discontinued Operations Plastic Packaging, Americas In August 2010, we completed the sale of our plastics packaging business and received gross proceeds of $280million. This amount included $15million of contingent consideration recognized at closing but did not include preliminary closing adjustments totaling $18.5million paid in the fourth quarter. The sale of our plastics packaging business included five U.S. plants that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles, as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets and liabilities.
Our plastics business employed approximately 1,000people and had manufacturing plants located in Ames, Iowa; Batavia, Illinois; Bellevue, Ohio; Chino, California; and Delran, NewJersey. The research and development operations were based in Broomfield and Westminster, Colorado.
Patents In the opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole.
Research and Development Research and development (R&D) efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation, specifically the development of new features, sizes, shapes and types of containers, as well as new uses for existing containers. Other R&D efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products. Our North American packaging R&D activities are primarily conducted in the Ball Technology & Innovation Center (BTIC) located in Westminster, Colorado. The European R&D activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in Bonn, Germany.
In our aerospace business, we continue to focus our R&D activities on the design, development and manufacture of innovative aerospace products and systems. This includes the production of spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency andsystem components, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions. Our aerospace R&D activities are conducted at various locations in the U.S.
Additional information regarding company R&D activity is contained in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report, as well as included in Item2, Properties.
Sustainability and the Environment Throughout our companys history, we have focused on our economic, social and environmental sustainability in all aspects of our businesses. We continue to make progress on the sustainability goals stated in our second sustainability report issued in June 2010.
Key issues for our company include reducing our use of electricity and natural gas; reducing waste and increasing recycling at our facilities; analyzing and reducing our water consumption; reducing our existing volatile organic compounds; and further improving safety performance in our facilities.
Page 5 of 100 The 2009 recycling rate in the U.S. for aluminum cans was 57percent, the highest recycling rate for any beverage container. The 2009 U.S. recycling rate for steel cans was 66percent. According to the most recently published data in North America, the aluminum can sheet we buy contains an average of 68percent total recycled content and the average total recycled content for steel sheet is 33percent.
Recycling rates vary throughout Europe but average around 63percent for aluminum containers and 70percent for steel containers, which exceeds the European Unions goal of 50percent recycling for metals. Due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel, metal packaging recycling rates in Europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials. Balls European operations help establish and financially support recycling initiatives in growing markets, such as Poland and Serbia, to educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel containers and to increase recycling rates. We have initiated a similar program in the PRC to educate consumers in that market regarding the benefits of recycling.
Compliance with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the company. As more fully described in Note21 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous othercompanies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. However, the companys information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
Legislation that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers, or would require diversion of solid wastes, including packaging materials, from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate. While deposit systems and other container-related legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future. If such legislation were widely adopted, it could potentially have a material adverse effect on the business of the company, including its liquidity, results of operations or financial condition, as well as on the packaging industry generally, in view of the companys substantial global sales and investment in metal container manufacturing. However, the packages we produce are widely usedand perform well in U.S. states, Canadian provinces and European countries that have deposit systems.
Employee Relations At the end of 2010, the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 8,900 employees in the U.S. and 5,100 in other countries. Further details of collective bargaining agreements are included within Item1A, Risk Factors, of this annual report.

Page 6 of 100 Item1A.Risk Factors Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world.
We may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to lower prices, exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability.
There can be no assurance that the companys business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company. (See Note3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report for details of acquisitions made during the three years ended December31, 2010, as well as Note23 for an acquisition completed in January 2011.) While we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans, if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of Ball, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:  demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition;  the diversion of managements attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations;  difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;  difficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures and policies;  expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and  retention of major customers and suppliers.
We may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately. The successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations, realize revenue opportunities and, to some degree, eliminate redundant and excess costs.
The loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its requirements, could have a significant negative impact on our sales.
We sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage, packaged food and household product companies, some of which operate in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.
Although the majority of our customer contracts are long-term, these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality, volume or market pricing requirements. Because we depend on relatively few major customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers.
The primary customers for our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. Our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks, including funding cuts and delays, technical uncertainties, budget changes, competitive activity and changes in scope.
Page 7 of 100 We face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability.
Competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense. Increases in productivity, combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price, service and quality, and in the aerospace industry are technical capability, cost and schedule. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and some may currently have significant excess capacity. Our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours. The global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances, which, in turn, could increase these competitive pressures.
We are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows.
Our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET, single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials. Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the U.S., the United Kingdom and the PRC. Certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions. There can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products, which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow.
Our packaging businesses have a narrow product range, and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased.
For the 12months ended December31, 2010, 73percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers. Our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to metal containers, or the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations.
We and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal, state and provincial laws and regulations. Each of our, and their, plants is subject to federal, state, provincial and local licensing and regulation by health, environmental, workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions. Requirements of governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing, manufacturing plant locations within the jurisdiction, product content and safety, climate change, workplace safety and health, environmental, expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products, and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products. In addition, we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal, state and provincial laws and regulations.
Significant environmental, employment-related and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving. The compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial, and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations.
We derived approximately 32percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the U.S. for the year ended December31, 2010. This sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are not limited to, the following:  political and economic instability in foreign markets;  foreign governments restrictive trade policies;  the imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties;  foreign exchange rate risks;  difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and  the geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world.
Page 8 of 100 Any of these factors, some of which are also present in the U.S., could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Historically, a portion of Balls operations, including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been denominated in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated. As a result, the U.S. dollar value of these operations has varied, and will continue to vary, with exchange rate fluctuations. Ball has been, and is presently, primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and the Brazilian real. We are also exposed, to a lesser extent, to fluctuations in the Argentine peso, Serbian dinar and Czech koruna.
A decrease in the value of any of these currencies compared to the U.S. dollar, could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
We manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and, as a result, we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. Our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results.
If we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement our key objectives.
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our experienced management team. Unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives.
Decreases in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our competitiveness.
Our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products, we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
Adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales.
We manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. Unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers. In addition, poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers. Climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world.
We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials.
We purchase aluminum, steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices. Economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages. Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the Americas, Europe and Asia, some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk. Our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase. Due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities, while increasing raw material costs may not impact our near-term profitability, increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time.
Page 9 of 100 Prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position.
As of December31, 2010, approximately 50percent of our approximately 4,700 North American packaging plant employees and approximately 85percent of our European packaging plant employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years. Although we consider our employee relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us.
Our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business, including those outlined below.
In our aerospace business, U.S. government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements or budgetary constraints; and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions. In such instances, Ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable cost and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination.
Our backlog includes both cost-type and fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of the work performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees.
Our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs.
Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated us, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. There is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide.
Net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill.
We have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2010. We are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill. The recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units. Fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows and discount rates. If general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business, we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units. This decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance, which could materially affect our U.S. GAAP net earnings and net worth.
If the investments in Balls pension plans do not perform as expected, we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities.
Ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its North American and United Kingdom employees, which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions. The plans assets consist primarily of common stocks, fixed income securities and, in the U.S., alternative investments. Market declines, longevity increases or legislative changes, such as the Pension Protection Act in the U.S., could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time, and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders equity.
Page 10 of 100 Restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures.
On December31, 2010, we had total debt of $2.8billionand unused committed credit lines of approximately $1billion. A reduction of financial liquidity could have important consequences, including the following:  restrict our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities.
In addition, more than one-third of our debt bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.
Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results.
U.S. GAAP and SEC accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years. Furthermore, the U.S. and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging accounting standards. These changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods. Additionally, material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate Ball. The material changes in net earnings and/or presentation of transactions could impact our credit rating and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner.
The global credit, financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
The global credit, financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations, including the following:  the creditworthiness of customers, suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials;  volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets, potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels;  a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants; and  reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our long-term strategy to increase liquidity, reduce debt, repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses.

Page 16 of 100 Item7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item8 of this report, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements inconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball Corporation, Ball, the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis.
OVERVIEW Business Overview Ball Corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured inplants around the world. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.
We sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Brazil and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in the U.S. and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contracts and long-term relationships generally mitigate the risk of customer loss. We are also subject to exposure from inflation and the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other inputs into our direct costs. We reduce our risk to these exposures either by fixing our material costs through derivative contracts or by including provisions in our sales contracts to recover the increases from our customers.
Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. Over the past two years, we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand. We have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our operations. To better realign capacity, we announced in 2010 the closure of our Richmond, British Columbia, plant and decided not to place into operations a plant in Lublin, Poland. In January 2011, we also announced that we will close our Torrance, California, plant and relocate a line from the Torrance plant to our Whitby, Ontario, plant.
As part of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits. This ongoing packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage, food and household products customers.
Page 17 of 100 While the North American metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the metal beverage container marketsin other parts of the world are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. We have been able to capitalize on growth by adding a plant, as well as additional capacity, in our consolidated Brazilian joint venture and by increasing capacity in some of our European metal beverage container manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion. In October 2010, we announced that we are expanding production of our lightweight Alumi-Tek bottle in our Golden, Colorado, facility, and in January 2011, we announced that we will commence specialty can production in our FortWorth, Texas, plant. In February 2011 we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing plant in northeast Brazil, which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country. The new plant will be located in Alagoinhas and is expected to start up in early 2012. The output from the first line has been contracted under a long-term agreement.
In July 2010, we entered the aluminum slug market by acquiring a leading North American manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans, beverage bottles, aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions. To further capitalize on this new product line, in January 2011, we completed the acquisition of a leading European supplier of aluminum aerosol cans and bottles and the aluminum slugs used to make them.
Balls consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item7A of this report.
The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. Federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance.
We recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost-to-cost, percentage of completion method of accounting. The 2010 contract mix consisted of approximately two-thirds cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and approximately 25percent fixed-price contracts. The remainder represents time and material contracts, which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. The backlog at December31, 2010, of $989million consists of approximately 45percent fixed price contracts, indicating a trend towards more fixed price business.
Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.s total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.
Management Performance Measures Management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); diluted earnings per share; cash flow from operating activities; free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment); and economic value added (net operating earnings after tax, as defined by the company, less a capital charge on net operating assets employed). These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. Additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).
We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of Ball and, because of that, we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the companys common stock as part of a diversified portfolio. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value added operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various long-term cash and stock compensation plans. Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee contributions with Ball common stock, employees, regardless of organizational level, have opportunities to own Ball stock.
Page 18 of 100 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Sales and Earnings ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 7,630.0 $ 6,710.4 $ 6,826.1 Net earnings from continuing operations 548.6 390.6 315.3 During 2010, we increased our investments in the growing Brazilian and PRC markets, initiated the consolidation of our salmon can production capacity, acquired a metal packaging-related business in North America to expand our product portfolio and were awarded significant new contracts in our aerospace business. In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of a metal packaging business in Europe and announced plans to realign capacity in the U.S. and Canada by closing a beverage container manufacturing plant in California, relocating a 12-ounce can production line to a Canadian plant and expanding specialty can production in a Texas plant.
Higher sales in 2010 were due largely to sales associated with current and prior year acquisitions and the consolidation of two joint ventures formerly accounted for as equity investments. The higher net earnings from continuing operations included $105.9million of gains associated with the fair value on the previous equity investments due to the required purchase accounting.
Effective June 2010, with the announced sale of the companys plastics packaging, Americas, business, the company has four reportable segments. After aggregating the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segments based on similar economic and qualitative characteristics, the four reportable segments are: (1)metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia; (2)metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3)metal food and household products packaging, Americas; and (4)aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in the U.S. and the PRC, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings.
Business Segment Discussions Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 3,848.6 $ 2,888.8 $ 2,989.5 Segment earnings $ 418.3 $ 296.0 $ 284.1 Business consolidation costs (a)  (6.8 ) (40.6 ) Total segment earnings $ 418.3 $ 289.2 $ 243.5 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
The metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through fiscal year 2008), Brazil (since August 2010) and the PRC, which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as non-beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold in the PRC. Balls acquisition of the remaining 65percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui (Foshan), PRC, (JFP) was completed in June 2010. In August 2010, we acquired an additional economic interest in our Brazilian joint venture (Latapack-Ball), and its results since the date of acquisition are consolidated and included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas, segment as of that time. In October 2009, Ball acquired three metal beverage can manufacturing plants and one beverage can end manufacturing plant from Anheuser-Busch InBev n.v./s.a. (AB InBev). The acquisitions are discussed in Note3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
Segment sales in 2010, as compared to 2009, were $959.8million higher primarily due to the four plants acquired from AB InBev, additional sales associated with JFP and the consolidation of the Latapack-Ball joint venture.
Page 19 of 100 Segment sales were $100.7million lower in 2009 than in 2008, primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices partially offset by an increase in sales volumes. The higher sales volumes in 2009 were the result of incremental volumes from the four plants purchased from AB InBev, partially offset by certain plant closures and lower sales volumes in the existing business.
Segment earnings in 2010 were $122.3million higher than in 2009 primarily due to a net $85million impact related to the higher sales volumes and $45million of product mix and improved manufacturing performance associated with higher production. Also adding to the 2010 improvement was the effect of a $7million out-of-period inventory charge in 2009. The details of the out-of-period adjustment are included in Note7 to the consolidated financial statements included within Item8 of this report.
Segment earnings in 2009 were higher than in 2008 due to $12million of earnings contribution from the four acquired plants and approximately $21million of savings associated with plant closures. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were lower carbonated soft drink and beer can sales volumes (excluding the newly acquired plants) and approximately $25million related to higher cost inventories in the first half of 2009.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 1,697.6 $ 1,739.5 $ 1,868.7 Segment earnings $ 212.9 $ 214.8 $ 230.9 Business consolidation costs (a) (3.2 )   Total segment earnings $ 209.7 $ 214.8 $ 230.9 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured inEurope. BallPackaging Europe has manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, theNetherlands, Poland and Serbia, and is the second largest metal beverage container business in Europe.
Segment sales in 2010 decreased $41.9million compared to 2009,primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects of $93million and price and mix changes, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Segment sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 were $129.2millionlower due to $110million of unfavorable foreign exchange effects, partially offset by better commercial terms. Sales volumes in 2009 were essentially flat compared to those in the prior year.
Segment earnings in 2010 decreased $1.9million compared to 2009, primarily the result of a $28million increase related to higher sales volumes, offset by $18million of negative effects from foreign currency translation and $12million of higher inventory and other costs.
While 2009 sales volumes were consistent with the prior year, the adverse effects of foreign currency translation, both within Europe and on the conversion of the euro to the U.S. dollar, reduced segment earnings by $8million. Also contributing to lower segment earnings were higher cost inventory carried into 2009 and a change in sales mix, partially offset by better commercial terms in some of our contracts.
On January18, 2011, Ball acquired Aerocan S.A.S. (Aerocan), a leading European supplier of aluminum aerosol cans and bottles, for 222.4million (approximately $300million) in cash and assumed debt. Aerocan manufactures extruded aluminum aerosol cans and bottles, and the aluminum slugs used to make them, for customers in the personal care, pharmaceutical, beverage and food industries. It operates three aerosol can manufacturing plants one each in the Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom and is a 51percent owner of a joint venture aluminum slug plant in France. The four plants employ approximately 560 people. The acquisition of Aerocan will allow Ball to enter a growing part of the metal packaging industry and to broaden the companys market development efforts into a new customer base.
Page 20 of 100 Metal Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 1,370.1 $ 1,392.9 $ 1,221.4 Segment earnings $ 129.1 $ 130.8 $ 68.1 Business consolidation gains (costs) (a) 18.3 (2.6 ) 1.6 Total segment earnings $ 147.4 $ 128.2 $ 69.7 (a) Further details of these items are included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina that manufacture and sell metal food, aerosol, paint and general line containers, as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs.
In July 2010, the company acquired Neuman Aluminum (Neuman) for approximately $62million in cash. Neuman is the leading North American manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans, beverage bottles, aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions and is composed of two plants, one in the U.S. and one in Canada, that employ approximately 180 people.
Segment sales in 2010 declined $22.8million compared to 2009, largely the result of $88million of lower commodity prices, partially offset by the sales associated with the Neuman plants.
Segment sales in 2009 increased $171.5million over 2008 due to higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs beginning in 2009, which were partially offset by an approximate $20million decrease in sales volumes caused by the effects of the economic recession and Balls decision to not pursue low margin business.
Segment earnings in 2010 decreased $1.7million compared to 2009 primarily due to $44million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 that did not occur in 2010, substantially offset by improved manufacturing and cost performance, favorable product sales mix and the addition of the Neuman plants.
Segment earnings in 2009 were $62.7million higher than in 2008 due primarily to the increased sales prices mentioned above coupled with $44million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 and $22million of improvements in manufacturing performance, partially offset by the lower sales volumes and a settlement gain of $7million in 2008 not recurring in 2009.
Aerospace and Technologies ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 713.7 $ 689.2 $ 746.5 Segment earnings $ 69.8 $ 61.4 $ 76.2 Gain on disposition (a)   7.1 Total segment earnings $ 69.8 $ 61.4 $ 83.3 (a) Further details of this item are included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
The aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and the providing of services used primarily in the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.
Segment sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, increased by $24.5million primarily due to increased scope on existing programs and new program starts, including WorldView-3 and several large classified programs. These increases were partially offset by the cancellation of the Orion program and the completion of several large programs, including Kepler and WorldView-2. Segment sales in 2009 were 8percent lower than in 2008, driven by the delivery of several large spacecraft during 2009.
Page 21 of 100 In addition to WorldView-3, some of the segments other high-profile contracts include: the James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Joint Polar Satellite System, the next-generation satellite weather monitoring system; the Global Precipitation Measurement-Microwave Imager, which will play an essential role in the Earths weather and environmental forecasting; and a number of antennas and sensors for the Joint Strike Fighter.
Segment earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009 increased by $8.4million due to favorable fixed-price program performance and higher sales, partially offset by the program reductions described above. Segment earnings in 2009 were down $14.8million compared to 2008, primarily attributable to the winding down of several large programs and overall reduced program activity.
On February15, 2008, Ball completed the sale of its shares in BSG to QinetiQ Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5million, including cash sold of $1.8million. The subsidiary provided services to the Australian department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1million.
Sales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 96percent ofsegment sales in 2010, 94percent in 2009 and 91percent in 2008. Contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December31, 2010 and 2009, was $989million and $518million, respectively. The increase in backlog is primarily due to the awards of the WorldView-3 and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) contracts. Comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations.
Discontinued Operations Plastic Packaging, Americas In August 2010, we completed the sale of our plastics packaging business and received gross proceeds of $280million. This amount included $15million of contingent consideration recognized at closing but did not include preliminary closing adjustments totaling $18.5million paid in the fourth quarter. The sale of our plastics packaging business included five U.S. plants that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles, as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets.
Our plastics business employed approximately 1,000 people and had sales of $635million in 2009. The manufacturing plants werelocated in Ames, Iowa; Batavia, Illinois; Bellevue, Ohio; Chino, California; and Delran, New Jersey. The research and development operations were based in Broomfield and Westminster, Colorado.
The following table summarizes the operating results for the discontinued operations for the years ended December31: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 318.5 $ 634.9 $ 735.4 Earnings from operations $ 3.5 $ 19.6 $ 18.2 Gain on sale of business 8.6   Loss on asset impairment (107.1 )   Loss on business consolidation activities (a) (10.4 ) (23.1 ) (8.3 ) Gain on disposition  4.3  Tax benefit (provision) 30.5 (3.0 ) (5.3 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax $ (74.9 ) $ (2.2 ) $ 4.6 (a) Includes net charges recorded to reflect costs associated with the closure of plastics packaging manufacturing plants.
Additional Segment Information For additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in Note2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report. The charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in Note5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
Page 22 of 100 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $356.8million, $309.0million and $259.4million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2010 was primarily due to $26million of higher employee compensation costs, including incentive compensation and stock-based compensation costs, including mark-to-market adjustments for the companys deferred compensation stock plans,$15million of nonrecurring gains in 2009 and $12million of other higher costs, partially offset by $5million of lower bad debt expense.
The increases in SG&A expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of approximately $31million of higher employee compensation costs, including incentive compensation costs, and higher stock-based compensation costs; $13million of gains in 2008 not recurring in 2009, including a $7million claim settlement and $7millionof death benefit insurance proceeds; and $8million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts. These were offset by net favorable decreased costs of $12million, including lower receivables securitization fees, legal expenses and research and development costs.
Interest and Taxes Consolidated interest expense was $158.2million in 2010, $117.2million in 2009 and $137.7million in 2008. Interest expense in 2010 included $8.8million for the call premium and write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized issuance premiums related to the redemption of Balls senior notes due December 2012, as well as the refinancing of the senior credit facilities in December 2010. The higher expense in 2010 was also due to higher levels of debt, including the issuance of $700million of senior notes in August 2009 and $500million of senior notes in November 2010. The lower expense in 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, partially offset by additional interest associated with the issuance of the August 2009 senior notes.
Based on current estimates, the 2011 effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 31percent.
Balls consolidated effective income tax rate for 2010 was 29.0percent compared to 29.8percent in 2009 and 32.1percent in 2008. The tax rate for 2010, as compared to 2009, included the accrual of a net $8million tax benefit due to a change in the tax status of a foreign investment, a net $11.8million benefit related to the refinancing of the companys senior credit facilities and an increased U.S. manufacturing tax benefit, offset by a higher 2010 tax provisionforuncertain tax positions and an $8.5million tax benefit realized in 2009 on thesale of shares in a stock investment resulting from a basis difference.
The lower tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to a $4million net increase in tax benefits as a result of a foreign tax settlement, legislative changes and a release of a valuation allowance for a net operating loss carryforward; an $8.5million tax benefit from the sale of shares in a stock investmentdue to a higher tax basis and a favorable change of $11million in the provision for uncertain tax positions due to tax settlements in several foreign jurisdictions. These benefits were partially offset by an increase due to the change in our earnings mix to higher taxed jurisdictions, lower research and development tax credits and a decrease in the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions coupled with increased withholding taxes.
Results of Equity Affiliates In August 2010, Ball acquired an additional 10.1percent economic interest in its Brazilian beverage packaging joint venture, Latapack-Ball, increasing the companys overall economic ownership interest in the joint venture to 60.1percent. In connection with the acquisition of the additional interest in Latapack-Ball, we recorded a gain of $81.8million on the fair value of the previously held 50percent equity ownership as a result of required purchase accounting.
In June 2010, we acquired Jianlibaos 65percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui (Foshan), PRC. We had owned 35percent of the joint venture plant since 1992. We acquired the 65percent interest for $86.9million in cash (net of cash acquired) and assumed debt, and also entered into a long-term supply agreement with Jianlibao and one of its affiliates. We recorded equity earnings of $24.1million, which was composed of equity earnings and a gain realized on the fair value of Balls previous 35percent equity investment as a result of required purchase accounting.
CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information regarding the companys critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
Page 23 of 100 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. The following summarizes our cash flows: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, includingdiscontinuedoperations $ 515.2 $ 559.7 $ 627.6 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities, includingdiscontinued operations (110.2 ) (581.4 ) (418.0 ) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (459.6 ) 100.8 (205.5 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included a use of $250million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program. At December31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $250million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the companys adoption of new prospective accounting guidance effective January1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet at December31, 2010, resulting in a $250million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. There were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at December31, 2010.
Excluding the $250million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above, cash flows provided by operations were $765.2million in 2010 compared to $559.7million in 2009 and $627.6million in 2008. The significant improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher pension funding. Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year, offset by the payment of approximately $70million to a customer for a legal settlement.
Management Performance Measures The following financial measurements are on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S.GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item8 of this report.
Free Cash Flow Management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1)to evaluate the companys operating results, (2)to plan stock buyback levels, (3)to evaluate strategic investments and (4)to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.
Page 24 of 100 Based on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows from operating activities, including discontinued operations $ 515.2 $ 559.7 $ 627.6 Adjust for increase in accounts receivable due to change in accounting for securitization program 250.0   Capital spending, including discontinued operations (259.4 ) (187.1 ) (306.9 ) Free cash flow $ 505.8 $ 372.6 $ 320.7 Based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2011 to be in excess of $900million, capital spending to be approximately $500million and free cash flow to be more than $400million. In 2011 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to continuing our stock repurchases and funding our capital spending programs.
Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA and Ratios Management internally uses adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) and adjusted net earnings to evaluate the companys performance. EBIT, EBITDA and net earnings are typically derived directly from the companys consolidated statement of earnings; however, they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.
Based on the above definitions, our calculation of adjusted EBIT is summarized below: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), as reported $ 764.6 $ 653.8 $ 580.6 Business consolidation activities (11.0 ) 21.4 43.8 Gain on dispositions  (34.8 ) (7.1 ) Adjusted EBIT $ 753.6 $ 640.4 $ 617.3 Our calculations of adjusted EBITDA, the adjusted EBIT to interest ratio and the net debt toadjusted EBITDA ratio are summarized below: ($ in millions, except ratios) 2010 2009 2008 Adjusted EBIT (as calculated above) $ 753.6 $ 640.4 $ 617.3 Add depreciation and amortization 265.5 243.1 249.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,019.1 $ 883.5 $ 867.2 Interest expense (excluding debt refinancing costs) $ 149.4 $ 117.2 $ 137.7 Total debt at December31 (a) $ 2,812.3 $ 2,596.2 $ 2,410.1 Less cash (152.0 ) (210.6 ) (127.4 ) Net Debt $ 2,660.3 $ 2,385.6 $ 2,282.7 Adjusted EBIT/Interest coverage 5.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 x Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA 2.6 x 2.7 x 2.6 x (a) Debt amounts at December31, 2009 and 2008, do not include amounts borrowed under the companys off-balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program of $250.0million at each period end.
Page 25 of 100 Our calculation of adjusted net earnings is summarized below: ($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation, as reported $ 468.0 $ 387.9 $ 319.5 Discontinued operations, net of tax 74.9 2.2 (4.6 ) Business consolidation activities, net of tax (9.3 ) 13.0 27.1 Gains and equity earnings related to acquisitions, net of tax (105.9 )   Gain on dispositions, net of tax  (30.7 ) (4.4 ) Debt refinancing costs, net of tax 5.3   Adjusted net earnings $ 433.0 $ 372.4 $ 337.6 Per diluted share from continuing operations, as reported $ 2.96 $ 2.05 $ 1.62 Per diluted share, as adjusted 2.36 1.96 1.74 Debt Facilities and Refinancing Interest-bearing debt at December31, 2010, increased $216.1million to $2.8billion from $2.6billion at December31, 2009. In December 2010, Ball replaced its senior credit facilities due October 2011 with new senior credit facilities due December 2015. The senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and include a $200million TermA loan denominated in U.S. dollars, a 51million TermB loan denominated in British sterling and a 100million TermC loan denominated in euros. The facilities also include (1)a multi-currency, long-term revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to approximately $850million and (2)a French multi-currency revolving facility that provides the company with up to $150million. The revolving credit facilities expire in December 2015.
In November 2010, Ball issued $500million of new 5.75percent senior notes due in May 2021. T he net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the borrowings under our TermD loan facility and for general corporate purposes.
In March 2010, Ball issued $500million of new 6.75percent senior notes due in September 2020. On that same date, the company issued a notice of redemption to call $509million in 6.875percent senior notes due December 2012 at a redemption price of 101.146percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. The redemption of the bonds occurred on April21, 2010, and resulted in a charge of $8.1million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized premiums. The charge is included in the 2010 statement of earnings as a component of interest expense.
At December31, 2010, approximately $976million was available under the companys committed multi-currency revolving credit facilities. The companys PRC operations also had approximately $20million available under a committed credit facility of approximately $52million. In addition to the long-term committed credit facilities, the company had $372million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2010, of which $76.2million was outstanding and due on demand, as well as approximately $175million of available borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization program.
In October 2010, the company renewed its receivables sales agreement for a period of one year. The size of the new program will vary between a maximum of $125million for settlement dates in January through April and a maximum of $175million for settlement dates in the remaining months.
Given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until December 2015, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements. While the recent financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.
We were in compliance with all loan agreements at December31, 2010, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in Notes12 and 6, respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
Page 26 of 100 Other Liquidity Items Cash payments required for long-term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December31, 2010, are summarized in the following table: Payments Due By Period (a) ($ in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5Years Long-term debt, including capital leases $ 2,750.1 $ 34.5 $ 188.3 $ 367.1 $ 2,160.2 Interest payments on long-term debt (b) 1,267.5 160.5 316.4 304.2 486.4 Operating leases 93.2 31.1 37.1 16.6 8.4 Purchase obligations (c) 6,586.9 2,709.5 3,779.4 98.0  Total payments on contractual obligations $ 10,697.7 $ 2,935.6 $ 4,321.2 $ 785.9 $ 2,655.0 (a) Amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at the year-end 2010 exchange rates.
(b) For variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging instruments.
(c) The companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. Alsoincluded are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where variable prices and/or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.
The table above does not include $60.1million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is uncertain.
Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, are expected to bein the range of $30million in 2011. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $71.4million, $74.0million, $77.1million, $80.3million and $84.9million for the years ending December31, 2011 through 2015, respectively, and a total of $483.1million for the years 2016 through 2020. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be between $21.8million (16.5million) to $23.2million (17.5million) in each of the years 2011 through 2015 and a total of $102.7million (77.5million) for the years 2016 through 2020.
For the U.S. pension plans in 2011, we changed our return on asset assumption to 8.00percent (from 8.25percent in 2010) and our discount rate assumption to an average of 5.55percent (from 6.00percent in 2010). Based on the changes in assumptions, pension expense in 2011 is anticipated to be relatively flat compared to 2010. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by a quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $2.9million increase in the 2011 global pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $3.5million of additional pension expense in 2011. Additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in Note14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
Annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 20cents per share in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Total dividends paid were $35.8million in 2010, $37.4million in 2009 and $37.5million in 2008. On January26, 2011, the companys board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividends to 7cents per share.
Share Repurchases Our share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $506.7million in 2010, $5.1million in 2009 and $299.6million in 2008. On November2, 2010, we acquired 2,775,408 shares of our publicly held common stock in a private transaction for $88.8million. On February17, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $125.0million of our common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. We advanced the $125.0million on February22, 2010, and received 4,323,598shares, which represented 90percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The agreement was settled on May20, 2010, and the company received an additional 398,206 shares.
Net repurchases in 2008 included a $31million settlement on January7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase of 1,350,000 shares.
From January1 through February24, 2011, Ball repurchased an additional $143.3million of its common stock.
Page 27 of 100 Contingencies The company is subject to routine litigation incident to operating its businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. The companys information indicates that the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. Details of the companys legal proceedings are included in Note21 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Forward-Looking Statements The company has made or implied certain forward-looking statements in this report which are made as of the end of the time frame covered by this report. These forward-looking statements represent the companys goals, and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied. From time to time we also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward-looking statements may change. Some factors that could cause the companys actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, demand and preferences; loss of one or more major customers or changes to contracts with one or more customers; insufficient production capacity; changes in senior management; the current global recession and its effects on liquidity, credit risk, asset values and the economy; overcapacity in foreign and domestic metal container industry production facilities and its impact on pricing; failure to achieve anticipated productivity improvements or production cost reductions, including those associated with capital expenditures; changes in climate and weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power; availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the increases in steel, aluminum and energy costs, and the ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs; changes in the pricing of the companys products and services; competition in pricing and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; insufficient or reduced cash flow; the number and timing of the purchases of the companys common shares; the effects of other restrictive packaging legislation, such as recycling laws; interest rates affecting our debt; labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs, including pension, medical and health care costs; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses of the companys defined benefit retirement plans; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other litigation; maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation; the authorization, funding, availability and returns of contracts for the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts and related services provided thereunder; delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules of performance associated with such segment contracts; international business and market risks, such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies; international business risks (including foreign exchange rates) in Europe and particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil; changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Czech koruna, and in the foreign exchange rate of theeuro against the British pound, Polish zloty and Serbian dinar; terrorist activity or war that disrupts the companys production or supply; regulatory action or laws affecting the company or its customers or suppliers, or any of their respective products, including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including in respect of climate change, or chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process, particularly publicity concerning Bisphenol-A, or BPA, a chemical used in the manufacture of epoxy coatings applied to many types of containers (including certain of those produced by the company); technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities associated therewith, including the recent disposition of our plastics business and the recent Neuman Aluminum acquisition; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits of our financial statements or managements evaluation of the companys internal control over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income and other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then the companys actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The company currently does not intend to publicly update forward-looking statements except as it deems necessary in quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC.
Page 28 of 100 Item7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Financial Instruments and Risk Management In the ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in respect of common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including that of its lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that our risk management policies and procedures will always be effective.
We have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk exposure has been defined as thechanges in fair value of derivative instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the sensitivity ofour market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below.
Commodity Price Risk We manage our commodity price risk in the Americas in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot-based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our aluminum packaging-related net sales in the Americas. We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing.
In Europe and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales contracts that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These contracts include fixed price, floating and/or pass-through pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement to minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes.
Most metal food and household products packaging, Americas, steel packaging-related sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2010 and in 2009, we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of the steel cost increases. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that may occur in 2011.
Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the companys ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the markets ability to accept price increases and the companys commodity price exposures under its contract terms, a hypothetical 10percent adverse change in the companys steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated $2.7million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Additionally, the company has foreign currency exposures on raw materials, and the effect of a 10percent adverse change is included in the total foreign currency exposure discussed below. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates.
The company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost. A hypothetical 10percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated $5.2million after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period. A hypothetical 10percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated $0.7million after-tax reduction of net earnings over the same period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates.
Page 29 of 100 Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we may use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December31, 2010, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps, which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments.
Based on our interest rate exposure at December31, 2010, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12months and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100-basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $4.5million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition, at times we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys earnings. Our foreign currency translation risk results from theeuro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso,Serbian dinar and Czech koruna. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the companys European operations into U.S. dollars.
Considering the companys derivative financial instruments outstanding at December31, 2010, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10percent reduction (U.S. dollar strengthening) in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in an estimated $27.3million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. This hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by $24.3million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes.
Equity Price Risk The companys deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and, accordingly, is marked to market using the companys closing stock price at the end of a reporting period. Based on current share levels in the program, each $1 change in the companys stock price has an effect of $1.7million on pretax earnings.
Page 30 of 100 Item8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ball Corporation: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing andevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for securitizations in 2010.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies andprocedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded theoperationsof Latapack-Ball Embalagens Ltda., Guangdong Jianlibao Group Co., Ltd and Neuman Aluminum from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations in 2010. We have also excluded the acquired operations from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The acquiredoperations are consolidated subsidiaries of the Company whose combined assets and combined net sales represented9percent and 3percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2010.

Page 35 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.Critical and Significant Accounting Policies The preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires Balls management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. These estimates are based on managements best judgment, knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that may be undertaken in the future. Balls management evaluates the estimates on an ongoing basis using the companys historical experience, as well as other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. The financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary, in the opinion of management, for the fair presentation of results.
Critical Accounting Policies The company considers certain accounting policies to be critical, as their application requires managements judgment about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Following is a discussion of the accounting policies the company considers critical to our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisitions The company records acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, the acquiring company records the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified and named, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. If the assets acquired are greater than the purchase price paid then a bargain purchase has occurred and the company will recognize the gain immediately in earnings. Among other sources of relevant information, the company uses independent appraisals and actuarial or other valuations to assist in determining the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities. Transaction costs associated with acquisitions are expensed as incurred and included in the business consolidation and other activities line of the consolidated statement of earnings.
For acquisitions where the company already owns an equity investment in the target company, the company will recognize in earnings, upon the completion of the acquisition, a gain or loss related to the companys existing equity investment. This gain or loss is calculated based on the fair value of the equity investment on the date of acquisition as compared to the carrying value of the investment.
Business Consolidation Costs The company estimates its liabilities for business consolidation activities by accumulating detailed estimates of costs and asset sale proceeds, if any, for each business consolidation initiative. This includes the estimated costs of employee severance, pension and related benefits; impairment of property and equipment and other assets, including estimates of net realizable value; accelerated depreciation; termination payments for contracts and leases; contractual obligations; and any other qualifying costs related to the exit plan. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall exit plan and are then monitored on a monthly basis. Such disclosures represent managements best estimates, but require assumptions about the plans that may change over time. Changes in estimates for individual locations and other matters are evaluated periodically to determine if a change in estimate isrequired for the overall restructuring plan. Subsequent changes to the original estimates are included in current period earnings and identified as business consolidation gains or losses.
Page 36 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets On an annual basis and at interim periods when circumstances require, the company tests the recoverability of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The companys indefinite-lived intangible assets are not significant to the consolidated financial statements. The goodwill testing utilizes a two-step impairment analysis, whereby the company compares the carrying value of each identified reporting unit to its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. The company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using the net present value of discounted cash flows, excluding any financing costs or dividends, generated by each reporting unit. The companys discounted cash flows are based upon reasonable and appropriate assumptions, which are weighted for their likely probability of occurrence, about the underlying business activities of the companys reporting units.
For this evaluation, our reporting units are consistent with our reportable segments identified in Note2 except that assets within metal beverage packaging, North America, are tested separately from those in metal beverage, Asia, and Latapack-Embalagens Ltda. These reporting units have been identified based on the level at which discrete financial information is reviewed by the segment management. When a business within a reporting unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition using the relative fair value methodology.
The company amortizes the cost of finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment, when deemed necessary, based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Employee Benefits The company has defined benefit plans that cover a significant portion of its employees. The company also has postretirement plansthat provide certain medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The relevant accounting guidance requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend rates, mortality and other assumptions. The company believes that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates, because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.
The company recognizes the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan on theconsolidated balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset, and each underfunded plan is recognized asa liability. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan. For pension plans, accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10percent corridor, the prior service cost and the transition asset are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants. For other postemployment benefits, the 10percent corridor is not used. Themajority of costs related to defined benefit and other postretirement plans are included in cost of sales; the remainder isincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
In addition to defined benefit and postretirement plans, the company maintains reserves for employee medical claims, up toour insurance stop-loss limit, and workers compensation claims. These are regularly evaluated and revised, as needed, based on a variety of information, including historical experience, actuarial estimates and current employee statistics.
Page 37 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions.
Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities.
The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision.
Derivative Financial Instruments The company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, raw materials purchasing, inflation rates and common share repurchases. The companys derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss associated with all hedges is reported in earnings immediately. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with gains and losses also reported immediately in earnings. In the consolidated statements of cash flows, derivative activities are classified based on the items being hedged. The accounting for our cash collateral calls related to our derivative activities are classified as investing activities as discussed in Note18.
Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of earnings consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged. Upon the early dedesignation of an effective derivative contract, the gains or losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive earnings until the originally hedged item affects earnings. Any gains or losses incurred after the dedesignation date are reported in earnings immediately.
Revenue Recognition in the Aerospace and Technologies Segment Sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment are primarily recognized under the cost-to-cost, percentage-of-completion method. This business segment sells using three types of long-term sales contracts (1)cost-type sales contracts, which represent approximately two-thirdsof segment net sales; (2)fixed price sales contracts, which represent 25percent of segment net sales; and (3)time and material contracts, which account for the remainder. A cost-type sales contract is an agreement to perform the contract for cost plus an agreed upon profit component, fixed price sales contracts are completed for a fixed price and time and material contracts involve the sale of engineering labor at fixed rates per hour. Cost-type sales contracts can have different types of fee arrangements, including fixed fee, cost, milestone and performance incentive fees, award fees or a combination thereof.
During initial periods of sales contract performance, our estimates of base, incentive and other fees are established at a conservative estimate of profit over the period of contract performance. Throughout the period of contract performance, the company regularly reevaluates and, if necessary, revises estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost and extent of progress toward completion. Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period that such losses are determined to be probable. Because of sales contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable generally include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed. As a prime U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, the aerospace and technologies segment is subject to a high degree of regulation, financial review and oversight by the U.S. government.
Page 38 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ball Corporation,itssubsidiaries and variable interest entities in which Ball Corporation is considered to be the primary beneficiary (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our). Equity investments in which the company exercises significant influence but doesnot control and is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in which the company does not exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.
Earnings per share and share information have been retrospectively adjusted for the two-for-one stock split that was effective on February15, 2011.
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method of accounting or the average cost method. Inventory cost is calculated for each inventory component taking into consideration the appropriate cost factors including fixed and variable overhead, material price volatility and production levels.
Depreciation and Amortization Property, plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings and improvements generally 10 to 40years; machinery and equipment2 to 15years; other intangible assets 9.4years, weighted average).
Deferred financing costs are amortized over the life of the related loan facility and are reported as part of interest expense. When debt is repaid prior to its maturity date, the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs, or pro rata portion thereof, is also reported as interest expense.
Under certain business consolidation activities, accelerated depreciation may be required over the remaining useful life for designated assets to be scrapped or abandoned. The accelerated depreciation related to plant closures is disclosed as part of the business consolidation costs in the appropriate period.
Environmental Reserves The company estimates the liability related to environmental matters based on, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. The company records the best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, the company assesses the potential liability related to pending matters and revises the estimates.
Page 39 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Revenue Recognition in the Packaging Segments The company recognizes sales of products in the packaging segments when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met. The four basic criteria are met when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
Fair Value Measurements Effective January1, 2008, the company adopted accounting guidance establishing a framework for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in the companys consolidated balance sheet. Effective January1, 2009, similar accounting guidance was adopted for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally accepted accounting principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability inan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price) and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value using the following definitions (from highest to lowest priority):  Level1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level2Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level3Prices or valuation techniques requiring inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
Stock-Based Compensation Ball has a variety of restricted stock and stock option plans, and the related stock-based compensation is primarily reported as part of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. The compensation cost associated with restricted stock grants has been calculated using the fair value at the date of grant (closing stock price) and is amortized over the restriction period. For the valuation of stock options, Ball has elected to use the Black-Scholes valuation model and amortizes the value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The companys deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and, accordingly, is marked to the closing price of the companys common stock at the end of each reporting period. Tax benefits associated with option exercises are reported in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Further details regarding the expense calculated under the fair value based method are provided in Note16.
Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred in connection with the companys internal programs for the development of products and processes. Costs incurred in connection with these programs, the majority of which are included in cost of sales, amounted to $22.2million, $26.4million and $30.9million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings as a component of shareholders equity.
Page 40 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Effective January1, 2010, Ball adopted accounting guidance that modifies the way entities account for securitizations and special-purpose entities. In connection with the adoption of the guidance, the company determined that its existing accounts receivable securitization program should be recorded on the balance sheet as of January1, 2010. Further details of this change in accounting are provided in Note6.
Also effective January1, 2010, the company adopted additional guidance regarding variable interest entities (VIE). The new guidance requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. It also amends previous guidance to require ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The adoption of the guidance did not change the accounting for VIEs in Balls consolidated financial statements. The company has a financial interest in one VIE of which Ball is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Additionally, the company has financial interests in other entities that are not considered VIEs under the current accounting guidance.
In January 2010, the FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements, specifically requiring the disclosure of transfers in and out of Level1 and 2 assets and liabilities (previously only required for those in Level3) and more specific detailed disclosure of the activity in Level3 fair value measurements (on a gross basis rather than a net basis). Thenew guidance also clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding the level of disaggregation of asset and liability classes, as well as the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for Level2 and Level3 fair value measurements. Thedisclosure requirement for transfers in and out of Level1 and 2 assets and liabilities was effective for Ball on January1, 2010, and had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. The reporting of Level3 activity on a gross basis will be effective for Ball as of January1, 2011, and is expected to affect only the Level3 pension plan assets, which do not represent a significant component of the total pension assets.
In April 2010, accounting guidance was issued to outline the criteria that should be met for determining when the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate in research or development transactions. The new guidance will be effective as of January1, 2011. Ball does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on its financial statements.
Page 41 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2.Business Segment Information Effective June 2010, with the announced sale of the companys plastics packaging, Americas, business (discussed in Note4), segment information was retrospectively adjusted. Balls operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and presented in four reportable segments.
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia : Consists of the metal beverage packaging, Americas, operations in the U.S., Canada and Brazil (since August 2010, as discussed in Note3), and the metal beverage packaging, Asia, operations in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The Americas and Asia segments have been aggregated based on similar economic and qualitative characteristics. The operations in this reporting segment manufacture and sell metal beverage containers, and also manufacture and sell non-beverage plastic containers in the PRC.
Metal beverage packaging, Europe : Consists of operations in several countries in Europe, which manufacture and sell metal beverage containers.
Metal food and household products packaging, Americas : Consists of operations in the U.S., Canada and Argentina, which manufacture and sell metal food, aerosol, paint and general line containers, as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs.
Aerospace and technologies : Consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and the providing of services used primarily in the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements and are discussed in Note1. We also have investments in companies in the U.S. and the PRC, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. We previously accounted for our investment in a Brazilian joint venture using the equity method of accounting. However, during August 2010, Ball acquired an additional economic interest in the joint venture and its results are now consolidated. Further details of the Brazilian transaction are available in Note3.
Major Customers Net sales to MillerCoors LLC were approximately9.9percent and 11.1percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and net sales to The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc., were approximately 10.4percent and 5.3percent of consolidated net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no major customers (defined as 10percent or more of consolidated net sales) for the year ended December31, 2008.

(Latapack-Ball) In August 2010, the company paid $46.2million to acquire an additional 10.1percent economic interest in its Brazilian beverage packaging joint venture, Latapack-Ball, through a transaction with the joint venture partner, Latapack S.A. This transaction increased the companys overall economic interest in the joint venture to 60.1percent and expands and strengthens Balls presence in the growing Brazilian market. As a result of the transaction, Latapack-Ball became a variable interest entity (VIE) under consolidation accounting guidelines with Ball being identified as the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidating the joint venture. Latapack-Ball operates metal beverage packaging manufacturing plants in Tres Rios, Jacarei and Salvador, Brazil and has been included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, reporting segment. In connection with the acquisition, the company recorded a gain of $81.8million on its previously held equity investment in Latapack-Ball as a result of required purchase accounting.
The following table summarizes the final fair values of the Latapack-Ball assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interest recognized, as well as the related investment in Latapack S.A., as of the acquisition date. The valuation was based on market and income approaches.

The intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis.
Neuman Aluminum (Neuman) In July 2010, the company acquired Neuman for approximately $62million in cash. Neuman had sales of approximately $128million in 2009 (unaudited) and is the leading North American manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans, beverage bottles, aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions. Neuman operates two plants, one in the United States and one in Canada, which employ approximately 180 people. The acquisition of Neuman is not material to the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment, in which its results of operations have been included since the acquisition date.
Guangdong Jianlibao Group Co., Ltd (Jianlibao) In June 2010, the company acquired Jianlibaos 65percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in Sanshui (Foshan), PRC. Ball has owned 35percent of the joint venture plant since 1992. Ball acquired the 65percent interest for $86.9million in cash (net of cash acquired) and assumed debt, and also entered into a long-term supply agreement with Jianlibao and one of its affiliates. The company recorded equity earnings of $24.1million, which was composed of equity earnings and a gain realized on the fair value of Balls previous 35percent equity investment as a result of required purchase accounting. The purchase accounting was completed during the third quarter of 2010. The acquisition of the remaining interest is not material to the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment.
Page 45 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 3.Acquisitions (continued) Anheuser-Busch InBev n.v./s.a. (AB InBev) In October 2009, the company acquired three of AB InBevs beverage can manufacturing plants and one of its beverage can end manufacturing plants, all of which are located in the U.S., for $574.7million in cash. The additional plants, which employ approximately 635 people, enhance Balls ability to serve its customers.
The plants operations were included in Balls results beginning October1, 2009, which amounted to approximately $160million of net sales and $12millionof operating earnings from that date through December31, 2009. In addition, a pretax charge of $11.1million was recorded during the year for transaction costs associated with the acquisition, which, in accordance with the guidance related to accounting for business combinations, were required to be expensed as incurred. The transaction costs are included in the business consolidation and other activities line of the consolidated statement of earnings.
Managements fair market valuation of acquired assets and liabilities was completed in 2009 and is summarized below: ($ in millions) Inventories $ 63.3 Property, plant and equipment 191.5 Goodwill 279.3 Other intangible assets 42.5 Current liabilities (1.9 ) Net assets acquired $ 574.7 The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition had occurred as of January1 of each period.

(DigitalGlobe) In May 2009, the company sold 75percent of its investment in DigitalGlobe, a provider of commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services, in conjunction with DigitalGlobes initial public offering. The sale generated proceeds of $37.0million and a non-operating pretax gain of $34.8million. The remaining investment in DigitalGlobe, classified as an other long-term asset, has been accounted for as a marketable equity investment and, as such, is marked to market, with the unrealized gain being held in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss). (See Note15.) Ball Solutions Group Pty Ltd (BSG) In February 2008, Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. (BATC) completed the sale of its shares in BSG for $8.7million, net of cash sold. BSG was previously a wholly owned Australian subsidiary of BATC that provided services to the Australian department of defense and related government agencies. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1million.
Page 47 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 5.Business Consolidation and Other Activities Following is a summary of business consolidation (charges)/gains included in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended December31: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Metal beverage packaging, Americas & Asia $  $ (6.8 ) $ (40.6 ) Metal beverage packaging, Europe (3.2 )   Metal food & household products packaging, Americas 18.3 (2.6 ) 1.6 Corporate other costs (4.1 ) (12.0 ) (4.8 ) $ 11.0 $ (21.4 ) $ (43.8 ) 2010 Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe During the fourth quarter of 2010, the company recorded a charge of $2.6million to write off capitalized installation costs associated with the decision not to complete a plant in Lublin, Poland. Also included in the fourth quarter were charges totaling $0.6million for transaction costs incurred for the January 2011 acquisition of Aerocan S.A.S. (See Note23.) Metal Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas In September 2010, Ball announced the closure of its metal food container manufacturing plant in Richmond, British Columbia. The plant, which produces steel cans for the Alaskan and Canadian salmon industry, will cease production in the first quarter of 2011, and its production capacity will be consolidated into other Ball facilities. In connection with the closure, the company recorded a charge of $4.6million primarily for severance and other employee benefits. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the company completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of its Richmond, British Columbia, facility resulting in a $5.1million gain on the sale net of estimated lease exit costs and other individually insignificant items.
During the third quarter of 2010, the company identified an accrual of a pension liability related to a Canadian plant closure that occurred in 2006. The amount of the accrual was $17.8million ($14.5million after tax) and was the result of recognizing the final settlement of the pension plan prior to the actual settlement of the pension obligation as defined in the pension accounting guidance. A third quarter 2010 out-of-period adjustment eliminated the excess pension liability balance related to the final settlement. The accrual for the pension settlement liability, as determined at that time, will be charged to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) upon final settlement of the related pension obligation when the criteria in the accounting guidance are deemed to have been met and all regulatory clearances have been given. Management has assessed the impact of this adjustment and does not believe these amounts were quantitatively or qualitatively material, individually or in the aggregate, to any previously issued financial statements, including the results of operations for 2006, or to the 2010 results of operations.
Corporate and Other Costs In the third and fourth quarter of 2010, charges totaling $1.0million were recorded primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Neuman (discussed in Note3). In the second quarter of 2010, charges of $3.1million were recorded primarily to establish a reserve associated with an environmental matter at a previously owned facility.
2009 Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia During the fourth quarter, income of $4.2million was recorded to reflect the reversal of previously recorded employee benefit charges taken primarily related to the closures of the Puerto Rico and Kansas City plants, which were announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. The reversal was due to the original estimates of group insurance and other employee-related costs being higher than actual experience rates. These gains were partially offset by other charges recognized in the fourth quarter totaling $1.0million primarily for fixed asset disposals where original adjustments to net realizable value were insufficient.
Page 48 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 5.Business Consolidation and Other Activities (continued) A charge of $0.7million was also recorded in the fourth quarter for acquisition costs required to be expensed related to the acquisition in the PRC of the remaining outstanding shares of Jianlibao. (See Note3.) During the third quarter, a charge of $1million was recorded, primarily for additional costs of winding down the Puerto Rico and Kansas City plants, the closures of which were announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the second quarter of 2009, a charge of $3.3million was taken for severance and other employee benefits related to a reduction of personnel in the plants and headquarters of the Americas portion of this segment. Most of the costs were paid by the end of 2009. In the first quarter of 2009, a charge of $5million was taken related to accelerated depreciation for operations that ceased at the Kansas City plant.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas In the fourth quarter, Ball recorded a charge of $2.6million primarily for higher than originally estimated employee benefit and lease termination costs related to previously announced plant closures.
Corporate Other Costs Charges of $12.0million were recorded in 2009 primarily for transaction costs required to be expensed for the acquisition of three metal beverage can plants and one beverage can end plant from AB InBev. (See Note3.) 2008 Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia On October30, 2008, the company announced the closure of two North American metal beverage can plants. A plant in Kansas City, Missouri, which primarily manufactured specialty beverage cans, was closed by the end of the first quarter of 2009 with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other North American beverage can plants. A plant in Puerto Rico, which manufactured 12-ounce beverage cans, was closed at the end of 2008. A pretax charge of $40.7million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge included $17million for employee severance, pension and other employment benefit costs; and $9million of accelerated depreciation and $14million for the write down to net realizable value of certain fixed assets and related spare parts. The carrying value of fixed assets remaining for sale in connection with the plant closures was $4.9million at December31, 2010.
On April23, 2008, the company announced plans to close a U.S. metal beverage packaging plant in Kent, Washington. A charge of $11.2million was recorded during the second and third quarters and included $9.2million for employee severance, pension and other employee benefit costs and $2million primarily related to accelerated depreciation and the write down to net realizable value of certain fixed assets, related spare parts and tooling inventory. The plant was shut down during the third quarter, and the land and building was sold in the fourth quarter for a gain of $4.1million. All remaining costs, excluding pension costs of $5.2million, were paid during 2009.
A gain of $7.2million was recorded in the second quarter for the recovery of previously expensed costs in a prior metal beverage business consolidation charge. This reflects a decision made in the second quarter to continue to operate existing end-making equipment and not install a new beverage can end module that would have been part of a multi-year project. The remaining reserves were utilized in 2010.
During 2007, the company settled a dispute with a U.S. customer, which was primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers it supplied. The customer received $85.6million on settlement of the dispute, and Ball retained all of the customers beverage can and end supply through 2015. The customer received a one-time payment of approximately $70.3million in January 2008 with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the contract through 2015.
Page 49 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 5.Business Consolidation and Other Activities (continued) Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas During 2008 the company recorded a net pretax gain of $1.6million for business consolidation activities. In addition to costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007, during the third quarter of 2008, a charge of $4.5million was recorded for lease cancellation costs on final shutdown of the Commerce, California, facility. In the fourth quarter, a $6.1million gain was recorded primarily related to managements decision in the fourth quarter to remain in the custom and decorative tinplate can business based on market conditions. All remaining reserves related to Commerce and Tallapoosa, Georgia (see 2007 discussion below), excluding lease cancellation costs, were utilized during 2009.
Corporate Other Costs During 2008 pretax charges of $4.8million were recorded for estimated environmental costs related to previously closed and sold facilities.
Summary Following is a summary of reserve activity by segment related to business consolidation activities for the year ended December31, 2010. The reserve balances are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
($ in millions) Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas Corporate and Other Costs Total Balance at December31, 2008 $ 28.2 $  $ 11.1 $ 7.7 $ 47.0 Charges (gains) in continuing operations 6.8  2.6 11.3 20.7 Charges (gains) in discontinued operations    23.8 23.8 Cash payments and other activity (24.6 )  (6.4 ) (32.6 ) (63.6 ) Balance at December31, 2009 10.4  7.3 10.2 27.9 Charges (gains) in continuing operations  3.2 (18.3 ) 4.1 (11.0 ) Charges (gains) in discontinued operations    10.4 10.4 Cash payments and other activity (2.9 ) (3.2 ) 20.5 (13.7 ) 0.7 Balance at December31, 2010 $ 7.5 $  $ 9.5 $ 11.0 $ 28.0 6.Receivables December31, ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Trade accounts receivable, net $ 774.3 $ 439.9 Other receivables 75.4 95.0 $ 849.7 $ 534.9 Trade accounts receivable are shown net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $11.9million at December31, 2010, and $13.6million at December31, 2009.
Page 50 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 6.Receivables (continued) A receivables sales agreement provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Balls North American packaging operations up to $175million. At December31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $250million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the companys prospective adoption of new accounting guidance effective January1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet resulting in a $250million increase in accounts receivable as compared to December31, 2009, as well as a corresponding working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. There were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at December31, 2010.
In October 2010, the company renewed its receivables sales agreement for a period of one year. The size of the new program varies between a maximum of $125million for settlement dates in January through April and a maximum of $175million for settlement dates in the remaining months.
Net accounts receivable under long-term contracts, due primarily from agencies of the U.S. government and their prime contractors, were $143.3million and $125.1million for the years ended December31,2010 and 2009, respectively, and included $85.7million and $50.4million, respectively, representing the recognized sales value of performance that had not been billed and was not yet billable to customers. The average length of the long-term contracts is approximately 3.5years, and the average length remaining on those contracts at December31, 2010, was 15months. Approximately $0.8million of unbilled receivables at December31, 2010, is expected to be collected after one year and is related to customary fees and cost withholdings that will be paid upon milestone or contract completions, as well as final overhead rate settlements.
7.Inventories December31, ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Raw materials and supplies $ 478.0 $ 426.2 Work in process and finished goods 605.9 455.0 $ 1,083.9 $ 881.2 In the fourth quarter of 2009, the company identified that ending inventory was not properly valued in its metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment. An adjustment was required in the normal inventory review process to properly value ending inventory, and an evaluation of the inventory valuation process was performed. This evaluation indicated that under the historic method used to value inventory in this segment, including determining appropriate deferred variances, the quarterly estimates of the deferred pricing variances did not adequately consider the impact of extreme price volatility and inventory turnover in ending inventories. Ball has modified its controls for capitalization of inventory variances. The modifications include a more timely review of variance calculations and a detailed metal price analysis. Additionally, the calculation methodology was modified to more accurately take into account the fluctuations in the London Metal Exchange pricing and inventory balances.
As a result of the evaluation, a cumulative $15.9million pretax out-of-period adjustment was recorded in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009, which should have impacted the prior three quarters of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008. Had the inventory been properly valued, pretax earnings would have been higher by $15.9million ($9.7million after tax or $0.11per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2009 full-year pretax earnings would have been higher by $7.1million ($4.3million after tax or $0.05per diluted share). Pretax earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2008 would have been lower by $7.1million ($4.3million after tax or $0.04per diluted share). Pretax earnings in the first and second quarters of 2009 would have been lower by $2.2million ($1.3million after tax or $0.01per diluted share) and $13.9million ($8.5million after tax and $0.09per diluted share), respectively. The third quarter 2009 pretax earnings would have been higher by $7.3million ($4.4million after tax and $0.04per diluted share). Management has assessed the impact of these adjustments and does not believe these amounts are quantitatively or qualitatively material, individually or in the aggregate, to any previously issued financial statements or to full-year results of operations for 2009 or 2008.

As a result of the announced sale of the plastics packaging, Americas, segment Ball determined that an update of the goodwill impairment testing was necessary for that segment during the second quarter of 2010. Based on the agreed upon contractual sales price and the net book value of the segment it was determined that an impairment charge of $107.1million ($75.2million after tax) was necessary.

11.Leases The company leases warehousing and manufacturing space and certain equipment in the packaging segments and office and technical space in the aerospace and technologies segment. During 2010 and 2005, we entered into leases that qualify as operating leases for book purposes and capital leases for tax purposes. Under these lease arrangements, Ball has the option to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term, or if we elect not to do so, to compensate the lessors for the difference between the guaranteed minimum residual values totaling $12.0million and the fair market value of the assets, if less. Certain of the companys leases in effect at December31, 2010, include renewal options and/or escalation clauses for adjusting lease expense based on various factors.
Total noncancellable operating leases in effect at December31, 2010, require rental payments of $31.1million, $22.6million, $14.5million, $10.5million and $6.1million for the years 2011 through 2015, respectively, and $8.4million combined for all years thereafter. Lease expense for all operating leases was $61.9million, $67.2million and $74.0million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and include the term loans described in the table above, as well as (1)a multi-currency, long-term revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to $850million and (2)a French multi-currency revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to $150million. The revolving credit facilities expire in December 2015. In connection with the refinancing, the company recorded a charge of $0.7million for the write off of unamortized financing costs. The charge is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
Page 54 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 12.Debt and Interest Costs (continued) In November 2010, Ball issued $500million of new 5.75percent senior notes due in May 2021. T he net proceeds from this offering were used to repay the borrowings under the TermD loan facility and for general corporate purposes.
In March 2010, Ball issued $500million of new 6.75percent senior notes due in September 2020. On that same date, the company issued a notice of redemption to call $509million of 6.875percent senior notes due December 2012 at a redemption price of 101.146percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. The redemption of these bonds occurred on April21, 2010, and resulted in a charge of $8.1million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized premiums. The charge is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
In connection with the acquisition of an additional economic interest in Latapack-Ball (see Note3), the company consolidated $148.3million of long-term debt, including a $135million bank loan. The $135million facility bears interest at variable rates and is due in October 2017. The Latapack-Ball debt facilities contain various covenants and restrictions but are non-recourse to Ball Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
At December31, 2010, approximately $976million was available under the companys committed multi-currency revolving credit facilities, which are available until December 2015. The companys PRC operations also had approximately $20million available under a committed credit facility of approximately $52million. In addition to the long-term committed credit facilities, the company had approximately $372million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2010, of which $76.2million was outstanding and due on demand, as well as approximately $175million of available borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization program.
As permitted, the companys long-term debt is not carried in the companys consolidated financial statements at fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt was estimated to be $2.83billion at December31, 2010, which approximated its carrying value of $2.74billion. The fair value was $2.54billion at December31, 2009, which approximated its then carrying value of $2.53billion. The fair value reflects the market rates at each period end for debt with credit ratings similar to the companys ratings. Rates currently available to the company for loans with similar terms and maturities are used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt based on discounted cash flows.
Long-term debt obligations outstanding at December31, 2010, have maturities of $34.5million, $66.0million, $122.3million, $152.7million and $214.4million for the years ending December31, 2011 through 2015, respectively, and $2,160.2million thereafter. Ball provides letters of credit in the ordinary course of business to secure liabilities recorded in connection with industrial development revenue bonds and certain self-insurance arrangements. Letters of credit outstanding at December31, 2010 and 2009, were $24.4million and $36.4million, respectively, including industrial development bonds of $5.4million and $9.4 million, respectively.
The senior notesand senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the companys wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the companys wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Note20 contains further details as well as required condensed, consolidating financial information for the company, segregating the guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries as defined in the senior notes agreements.
The company was in compliance with all loan agreements at December31, 2010 and 2009, and has met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividend payments, share repurchases, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.

Page 56 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 13.Taxes on Income (continued) The income tax provision recorded within the consolidated statements of earnings differs from the provision determined by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to pretax earnings as a result of the following: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Statutory U.S. federal income tax $ 212.2 $ 187.8 $ 155.0 Increase (decrease) due to: Foreign tax rate differences (15.0 ) (14.3 ) (26.2 ) Company and trust-owned life insurance (4.6 ) (5.4 ) 2.5 Research and development tax credits (1.2 ) (0.9 ) (4.9 ) Manufacturing deduction (9.7 ) (4.0 ) (3.3 ) Net change in valuation allowance on foreign losses 1.8 (4.5 ) 1.8 State and local taxes, net 13.1 10.7 10.4 Uncertain tax positions, including interest 3.3 (2.6 ) 8.7 Statutory rate reduction and legislative changes (1.1 )  (4.5 ) Change in foreign subsidiary tax status (a) (8.0 )   Worldwide debt refinancing (a) (11.8 )   Acquired tax attribute adjustment (2.3 ) (4.6 )  Withholding and other foreign taxes, net 5.6 11.2 2.0 Foreign tax holiday (1.9 ) (1.3 ) (0.3 ) Basis differences for asset sales  (8.5 )  Other, net (4.6 ) (3.8 ) 0.9 Provision for taxes $ 175.8 $ 159.8 $ 142.1 Effective tax rate expressed as a percentage of pretax earnings 29.0 % 29.8 % 32.1 % (a) Decrease in tax is net of a provision for uncertain tax positions and any applicable impact to the U.S. manufacturing deduction.
Balls consolidated effective income tax rate for 2010 was 29.0percent compared to 29.8percent in 2009 and 32.1percent in 2008. The tax rate for 2010, as compared to 2009, included the accrual of a tax benefit for a change in the tax status of a foreign investment, a benefit related to the refinancing of the companys senior credit facilities and an increased U.S. manufacturing tax benefit, offset by a higher2010provision for uncertain tax positions and a tax benefit realized in 2009 on thesale of shares in a stock investment as a result of a basis difference.
The 2009 effective rate of 29.8percent was lower than in 2008 primarily due to tax benefits related to a higher tax basis in the sale of certain assets, the release of a valuation allowance on net operating losses in the Netherlands and a net release for uncertain tax positions primarily related to tax settlements in several foreign jurisdictions. These reductions were somewhat offset by an overall increase in the effective tax rate due to an increase in earnings mix in the U.S., which is the companys highest tax rate jurisdiction, a reduction in research and development tax credits and an increased effective tax rate in China due to a phase in of increased tax rates and increased withholding taxes.
In 2005 Ball Packaging Europes Serbian subsidiary was granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, the earnings of this subsidiary are exempt from income taxation for a period of 10years beginning in the first year the Serbian subsidiary has taxable earnings. As of December31, 2010, the 10-year period had commenced and five years remain. The Serbian subsidiary has also been granted a tax credit equal to 80percent of additional localinvestments. The credit maybe used to offset tax on earnings not covered by the tax holidayand has a 10-year life beginning in 2010. Pursuant to the additional investment in Balls Brazilian joint venture as discussed in Note3, Ball has included the impact of a Brazilian tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday which expires in 2018, a certain portion of Brazils annual earnings receive a 25percent tax exemption.
Page 57 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 13.Taxes on Income ( continued ) Net income tax payments were $146.0million, $200.4million and $120.3million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Balls Canadian subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards, with no expiration date, of $70.4million with a related tax benefit of $21.2million. In addition, Balls Argentine subsidiary had a net operating loss carryforward of $3.3million, expiring in 2013 and 2014, with a related tax benefit of $1.1million. Due to the uncertainty of ultimate realization, these European,Canadian and Argentine benefits have been fully offset by valuation allowances. The company also had $1.2million of miscellaneous tax attributes with no valuation allowance due to expected realization. At December31, 2010, the company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $25.5million expiring between 2015 and 2020; however, due to the uncertainty of realization of the entire foreign tax credit, a valuation allowance of $23.5million has been applied to reduce the carrying value to $2.0million.

At December31, 2010, the amount of unrecognized tax benefitsthat, if recognized, would reduce tax expense was $60.1million.Within the next 12months,it is reasonably possible thatunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $3.4million as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitation. The company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2005.The company's significant non-U.S. filings are inGermany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland,Serbia, the PRC, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. At December31, 2010, the company had ongoing examinations by tax authorities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, for which adequate provision has been made.
The company recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Ball recognized $2.5million, $3.5million and $3.1million of additional income tax expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for potential interest on these items. At December31, 2010 and 2009, t he accrual for uncertain tax positionsincluded potential interest expense of $9.1million and $8.5million, respectively. No penalties have been accrued.
Managements intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings of Balls controlled foreign corporations and, as a result, no U.S. income or foreign withholding tax provision has been made. It is not practicable to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings. As more fully described in Note3, in August 2010, Ball increased its economic interest in its Brazilian joint venture. Due to the nature of the investment, Ball has elected to provide deferred tax on the undistributed earnings of this incremental investment. For 2010, the deferred tax accrual was $0.9million, and for earnings undistributed prior to the acquisition date, the deferred tax accrual was $3.5million.

The employee becomes a general unsecured creditor of the company with respect to amounts deferred. Amounts deferred into the deferred compensation stock plan receive a 20percent company match with a maximum match of $20,000 per year. Amounts deferred into the stock plan are represented in the participants account as stock units, with each unit having a value equivalent to one share of Balls common stock. Participants in the stock plan are allowed to reallocate a prescribed number of units to other notional investment funds subject to specified time constraints.
The companys pension plans cover substantially all U.S., Canadian and European employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The defined benefit plans for salaried employees, as well as those for hourly employees in Germany and the United Kingdom, provide pension benefits based on employee compensation and years of service. Plans for North American hourly employees provide benefits based on fixed rates for each year of service. While the German plans are not funded, the company maintains book reserves, and annual additions to the reserves are generally tax deductible. With the exception of the German plans, our policy is to fund the plans in amounts at least sufficient to satisfy statutory funding requirements taking into consideration what is currently deductible under existing tax laws and regulations.

Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, are expected to be inthe range of $30million in 2011. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $71.4million, $74.0million, $77.1million, $80.3million and $84.9million for the years ending December31, 2011 through 2015, respectively, and a total of $483.1million for the years 2016 through 2020. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately $21.8million (16.5million) to $23.2million (17.5million) in each of the years 2011 through 2015 and a total of $102.7million (77.5million) for the years 2016 through 2020.
Page 62 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14.Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the North American plans at December31 were: U.S.
Canada 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.55 % 6.00 % 6.25 % 4.75 % 5.00 % 7.00 % Rate of compensation increase 4.80 % 4.80 % 4.80 % 3.25 % 3.50 % 3.50 % Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the European plans at December31 were: United Kingdom Germany 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Discount rate 5.50 % 5.75 % 6.10 % 5.00 % 5.00 % 5.75 % Rate of compensation increase 4.25 % 4.25 % 3.80 % 2.75 % 2.75 % 2.75 % Pension increase (a) 3.50 % 3.40%/2.50 % 2.50 % 1.75 % 1.75 % 1.75 % (a) For the United Kingdom, the first percentage in 2009 applies to benefits earned between January1, 1995, and June30, 2008, and the second percentage applies to benefits earned after June30, 2008.
The discount and compensation increase rates used above to determine the benefit obligations at December31, 2010, will be used to determine net periodic benefit cost for 2011.
A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an approximate $2.9million increase in the 2011 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $3.5million of additional pension expense in 2011.
Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the North American plans for the years ended December31 were: U.S.

Current financial accounting standards require that the discount rates used to calculate the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations reflect the time value of money as of the measurement date of the benefit obligation and reflect the rates of return currently available on high quality fixed income securities whose cash flows (via coupons and maturities) match the timing and amount of future benefit payments of the plan. In addition, changes in the discount rate assumption should reflect changes in the general level of interest rates.
Page 63 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14.Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) In selecting the U.S. discount rate for December31, 2010, several benchmarks were considered, including Moodys long-term corporate bond yield for A bonds and the Citigroup Pension Liability Index. In addition, the expected cash flows from the plans were modeled relative to the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matched to cash flows from a portfolio of bonds rated A or better. When determining the appropriate discount rate, the company contemplated the impact of lump sum payment options under its U.S. plans when considering the appropriate yield curve. In Canada the markets for locally denominated high-quality, longer term corporate bonds are relatively thin. As a result, the approach taken in Canada was to use yield curve spot rates to discount the respective benefit cash flows and to compute the underlying constant bond yield equivalent. The Canadian discount rate at December31, 2010, was selected based on a review of the expected benefit payments for each of the Canadian defined benefit plans over the next 60years and then discounting the resulting cash flows to the measurement date using the AA corporate bond spot rates to determine the equivalent level discount rate. In the United Kingdom and Germany, the company and its actuarial consultants considered the applicable iBoxx 15+ year AA corporate bond yields for the respective markets and determined a rate consistent with those expectations. In all countries, the discount rates selected for December31, 2010, were based on therange of values obtained from cash flow specific methods, together with the changes in the general level of interest rates reflected by the benchmarks.
The assumption related to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits over the life of the plans. The assumption was based upon Balls pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance was placed on historical asset returns of our plans. An asset-return model was used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class correlation. The analysis included expected future risk premiums, forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indexes, expected inflation and real risk-free interest rate assumptions and the funds expected asset allocation.
The expected long-term rates of return on assets were calculated by applying the expected rate of return to a market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted average expected contributions and benefit payments. The market related value of plan assets used to calculate expected return was $1,106.5million for 2010, $968.1million for 2009 and $1,052.4million for 2008.
Included in other comprehensive earnings, net of the related tax effect, were increases in pension and other postretirement item obligations of $13.4million, $22.6million and $147.8million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
For pension plans, accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets Policies and Allocation Information Investment policies and strategies for the plan assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are established by pension investment committees of the company and its relevant subsidiaries and include the following common themes: (1)to provide for long-term growth of principal income without undue exposure to risk, (2)to minimize contributions to the plans, (3)to minimize and stabilize pension expense and (4)to achieve a rate of return above the market average for each asset class over the long term. The pension investment committees are required to regularly, but no less frequently than once annually, review asset mix and asset performance, as well as the performance of the investment managers. Based on their reviews, which are generally conducted quarterly, investment policies and strategies are revised as appropriate.
Page 64 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14.Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Target asset allocations in the U.S. and Canada are set using a minimum and maximum range for each asset category as a percent of the total funds market value. Assets contributed to the United Kingdom plans are invested using established percentages. Following are the target asset allocations established as of December31, 2010: U.S.
Canada (c) United Kingdom Cash and cash equivalents 0-10 % 0-5 %  Equity securities 10-75 % (a) 10-30 % (d) 56-62 % (e) Fixed income securities 25-70 % (b) 75-80 % 38-44 % Alternative investments 0-35 %   (a) Equity securities may consist of: (1)up to 25percent large cap equities, (2) up to 10percent mid cap equities, (3)up to 10percent small cap equities, (4)up to 35percent foreign equities and (5)up to 35percent special equities. Holdings in Ball Corporation common stock or Ball bonds cannot exceed 5percent of the trusts assets.
(b) Debt securities may include up to 10percent non-investment grade bonds, up to 10percent bank loans and up to 15percent international bonds.
(c) Does not include assets held in immunized portfolios designated for closed plants. These portfolios must consist of at least 85percent fixed income securities and up to 15percent cash and short-term investments. They can consist of up to 100percent Canadian federal or provincial securities. The immunized portfolio assets represented approximately 45percent of the total Canadian assets at December31, 2010.
(d) May include between 5percent and 15percent non-Canadian equity securities.
(e) Equity securities must consist of United Kingdom securities and up to 44percent foreign securities.
The actual weighted average asset allocations for Balls defined benefit pension plans, which individually are within the established targets for each country, were as follows at December31: 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents 8 % 3 % Equity securities 28 % 40 % Fixed income securities 54 % 47 % Alternative investments 10 % 10 % 100 % 100 % Fair Value Measurements of Pension Plan Assets Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension assets measured at fair value: Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with brokers and short-term U.S. Treasury money market funds and are net of receivables and payables for securities traded at the period end but not yet settled. All cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Corporate equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual security is traded.
U.S. government and agency securities: Valued at closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Other U.S. governmental and agency securities are valued using the pricing of similar agency issues, live trading feeds from several vendors and/or benchmark yields.
Corporate bonds and notes: Valued using market inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications. Inputs may be prioritized differently at certain times based on market conditions.
Mutual funds: Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the plans at year end. The NAV is calculated based on the underlying shares and investments held by the fund.
Page 65 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14.Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Limited partnerships and other: Certain of the partnership investments receive fair market valuations on a quarterly basis. Certain other partnerships invest in market-traded securities, both on a long and short basis. These investments are valued using quoted market prices. For the partnership that invests in timber properties, a detailed valuation is performed by an independent appraisal firm every three years. In the interim years, the investment manager updates the independently prepared valuation for property value changes, timber growth, harvesting, etc.
The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.Furthermore, although the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
The companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The levels assigned to the defined benefit plan assets as of December31, 2010, are summarized in the table below.

Employees may also qualify for long-term disability, medical and life insurance continuation and other postemployment benefits upon termination of active employment prior to retirement. Allof the Ball-sponsored postretirement health care and life insurance plans are unfunded and, with the exception of life insurance benefits, are self-insured.
In Canada, the company provides supplemental medical and other benefits in conjunction with Canadian provincial health care plans. Most U.S. salaried employees who retired prior to 1993 are covered by noncontributory defined benefit medical plans with capped lifetime benefits. Ball provides a fixed subsidy toward each retirees future purchase of medical insurance for U.S. salaried and substantially all nonunion hourly employees retiring after January1, 1993. Life insurance benefits are noncontributory. Ball has no commitments to increase benefits provided by any of the postemployment benefit plans.
Page 67 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14.Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) An analysis of the change in other postretirement benefit accruals for 2010 and 2009 follows: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at prior year end $ 191.8 $ 177.7 Service cost 2.5 3.0 Interest cost 10.2 10.8 Benefits paid (11.9 ) (12.8 ) Net actuarial loss (gain) (2.3 ) 8.5 Business acquisition  1.6 Curtailment gain (1.8 )  Plan amendments (4.9 )  Effect of exchange rates and other 1.1 3.0 Benefit obligation at year end 184.7 191.8 Change in plan assets: Fair value of assets at prior year end   Benefits paid (12.4 ) (12.9 ) Employer contributions 11.9 12.8 Medicare Part D subsidy 0.5 0.1 Fair value of assets at end of year   Funded status $ (184.7 ) $ (191.8 ) Components of net periodic benefit cost were: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Service cost $ 2.5 $ 3.0 $ 3.2 Interest cost 10.2 10.8 10.5 Amortization of prior service cost 0.2 0.4 0.3 Recognized net actuarial gain 0.8 0.4 0.4 Net periodic benefit cost $ 13.7 $ 14.6 $ 14.4 Approximately $0.7million of estimated net actuarial loss will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net period benefit cost during 2011. The amount of prior service cost to be amortized is insignificant.
The assumptions used for the determination of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost were the same as those used for the U.S. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans. For other postretirement benefits, accumulated actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.
For the U.S. health care plans at December31, 2010, a 9percent health care cost trend rate was used for pre-65 and post-65 benefits, and trend rates were assumed to decrease to 5percent in 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. For the Canadian plans, an 8percent health care cost trend rate was used, which was assumed to decrease to 5percent by 2017 and remain at that level in subsequent years. Benefit payment caps exist in many of the companys health care plans.
Health care cost trend rates can have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase or decrease the total of service and interest cost by $0.4million and the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $5.0million to $5.6million.
Page 68 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14.Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Other Benefit Plans The company matches U.S. salaried employee contributions to the 401(k) plan with shares of Ball common stock up to 100percent of the first 3percent of a participants salary plus 50percent of the next 2percent. The expense associated with the company match amounted to $20.5million, $21.8million and $20.7million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
In addition, substantially all employees within the companys aerospace and technologies segment who participate in Balls 401(k) plan receive a performance-based matching cash contribution of up to 4percent of base salary. The company recognized $3.0million and $8.4million of additional compensation expense related to this program for the years 2010 and 2008, respectively. There was no matching contribution for 2009.
In 2010 the companys 401(k) plan matching contributions for salaried employees could not exceed $9,800 per employee and the limit on employee contributions was $16,500 per employee.
15.Shareholders Equity At December31, 2010, the company had500million shares of common stock and 15million shares of preferred stock authorized, both without par value. Preferred stock includes 550,000 authorized but unissued shares designated as SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
Under the companys shareholder Rights Agreement dated July26, 2006, as amended, one half of a preferred stock purchase right (Right) is attached to each outstanding share of Ball Corporation common stock. Subject to adjustment, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one-thousandth of a share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $185per Right. Subject to certain limited exceptions for passive investors, if a person or group acquires 10percent or more of the companys outstanding common stock (or upon occurrence of certain other events), the Rights (other than those held by the acquiring person) become exercisable and generally entitle the holder to purchase shares of Ball Corporation common stock at a 50percent discount. The Rights, which expire in 2016, are redeemable by the company at a redemption price of $0.001cent per Right and trade with the common stock. Exercise of such Rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire control of the company without the approval of Balls board of directors. The Rights would not interfere with any merger or other business combinations approved by the board of directors.
The companys share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $506.7million in 2010, $5.1million in 2009 and $299.6million in 2008. On November2, 2010, the company acquired 2,775,408shares of its publicly held common stock in a private transaction for $88.8million. On February17, 2010, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $125.0million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the $125.0million on February22, 2010, and received 4,323,598shares, which represented 90percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The agreement was settled on May20, 2010, and the company received an additional 398,206shares.
Net repurchases in 2008 included a $31million settlement on January7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase of 1,350,000shares.
From January1 through February24, 2011, Ball repurchased an additional $143.3million of common stock.

The change in the pension and other postretirement items is presented net of related tax benefits of $2.2million, $15.2million and $93.9million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The change in the effective financial derivatives is presented net of related tax expense of $24.1million and $58.9million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a related tax benefit of $42.5million for 2008. The gain on available for sale securities is presented net of related tax expense of $2.0million and $4.5million for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Page 70 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 16.Stock-Based Compensation Programs The company has shareholder-approved stock option plans under which options to purchase shares of Ball common stock have been granted to officers and employees at the market value of the stock at the date of grant. Payment must be made at the time of exercise in cash or with shares of stock owned by the option holder, which are valued at fair market value on the date exercised. In general, options are exercisable in four equal installments commencing one year from the date of grant and terminating 10years from the date of grant. A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December31, 2010, follows: Outstanding Options (a) Nonvested Options (a) Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Beginning of year 11,628,376 $ 18.96 4,940,534 $ 5.64 Granted 1,936,700 25.23 1,936,700 6.84 Vested (2,623,846 ) 5.76 Exercised (2,460,826 ) 12.72 Canceled/forfeited (337,604 ) 22.99 (334,704 ) 5.93 End of period 10,766,646 21.39 3,918,684 6.13 Vested and exercisable, end of period 6,847,962 20.29 Reserved for future grants 8,736,470 (a) Amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for the two-for-one stock split that was effective on February15, 2011.
The options granted in January 2010 included 1,013,400 stock-settled stock appreciation rights, which have the same terms as the stock options. The weighted average remaining contractual term for all options outstanding at December31, 2010, was 6.4years and the aggregate intrinsic value (difference in exercise price and closing price atthat date) was $136.0million. The weighted average remaining contractual term for options vested and exercisable at December31, 2010, was 5.3years and the aggregate intrinsic value was $94.0million. The company received $70.7million from options exercised during 2010. The intrinsic value associated with these exercises was $39.4million, and the associated tax benefit reported as other financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows was $12.7million. The total fair value of options vested during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $15.1million, $7.1million and $6.0million, respectively.
These options cannot be traded in any equity market. However, based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, options granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 have estimated weighted average fair values at the date of grant of $6.84per share, $5.32per share and $6.41per share, respectively. The actual value an employee may realize will depend on the excess of the stock price over the exercise price on the date the option is exercised. Consequently, there is noassurance that the value realized by an employee will be at or near the value estimated. The fair values were estimated using the following weighted average assumptions: 2010 Grants 2009 Grants 2008 Grants Expected dividend yield 0.79 % 1.0 % 0.80 % Expected stock price volatility 28.99 % 29.83 % 24.48 % Risk-free interest rate 2.47 % 1.74 % 2.99 % Expected life of options 4.9years 5.25years 5.25years In addition to stock options, the company issues to officers and certain employees restricted shares and restricted stock units, which vest over various periods. Other than the performance-contingent grants discussed below, such restricted shares and restricted stock units generally vest in equal installments over five years. Compensation cost is recorded based upon the fair value of the shares at the grant date.
Page 71 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 16.Stock-Based Compensation Programs ( continued ) To encourage certain senior management employees and outside directors to invest in Ball stock, Ball adopted a deposit share program in March 2001 (subsequently amended and restated in April 2004) that matches purchased shares with restricted shares. In general, restrictions on the matching shares lapse at the end of four years from date of grant, or earlier in stages if established share ownership guidelines are met, assuming the relevant qualifying purchased shares are not sold or transferred prior to that time. Grants under the plan are accounted for as equity awards and compensation expense is recorded based upon the closing market price of the shares at the grant date. The company recorded $0.4million, $1.6million and $3.8million of expense in connection with this program in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The companys board of directors grants performance-contingent restricted stock units to key employees, which will cliff-vest if the companys return on average invested capital during a 36-month performance period is equal to or exceeds the companys cost of capital. If the performance goals are not met, the shares will be forfeited. Current assumptions are that the performance targets will be met and, accordingly, grants under the plan are being accounted for as equity awards and compensation expense is recorded based upon the closing market price of the shares at the grant date. On a quarterly basis, the company reassesses the probability of the goals being met and adjusts compensation expense as appropriate. No such adjustment was considered necessary at the end of 2010 for any grants. Restricted stock units granted under this program included 362,300units in January 2010, 386,900units in January 2009 and 493,300units in April 2008. The expense associated with the performance-contingent grants totaled $9.5million, $9.9million and $6.2million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses pretax expense of $24.4million ($14.9million after tax), $26.5million ($16.0million after tax) and $20.5million ($12.4million after tax), respectively, for share-based compensation arrangements. At December31, 2010, there was $35.9million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized in earnings over a weighted average period of 2.3years.
In connection with the employee stock purchase plan, the company contributes 20percent of up to $500 of each participating employees monthly payroll deduction toward the purchase of Ball Corporation common stock. Company contributions for this plan were $3.2million in 2010, $3.0million in 2009 and $3.2million in 2008.
17.Earnings Per Share Years ended December31, ($ in millions, except per share amounts; shares in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Diluted Earnings per Share (a) : Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation $ 468.0 $ 387.9 $ 319.5 Weighted average common shares 180,746 187,572 191,714 Effect of dilutive securities 2,792 2,406 2,324 Weighted average shares applicable to diluted earnings per share 183,538 189,978 194,038 Basic earnings per share $ 2.59 $ 2.07 $ 1.67 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.55 $ 2.04 $ 1.65 (a) Shares have been retrospectively adjusted for the two-for-one stock split that was effective on February15, 2011.
Certain options were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive (i.e., the sum of the proceeds, including the unrecognized compensation and windfall tax benefits, exceeded the average closing stock price for the period). The options excluded totaled 1,683,300 in 2010; 5,727,828 in 2009; and 4,969,158 in 2008.
Information needed to compute basic earnings per share is provided in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management Policies and Procedures In the ordinary course of business, Ball employs established risk management policies and procedures, which seek toreduce Balls exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in regard to common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including lenders, on a regular basis, but Ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective.
Commodity Price Risk Balls metal beverage container operations manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods. First, the company enters into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot-based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot component pricing. This matched pricing affects the majority of Balls North American metal beverage packaging net sales. Second, Ball uses certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes andpricing.
The company had aluminum contracts limiting its aluminum exposure with notional amounts of approximately $1.0billion and $1.1billion at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The aluminum contracts include derivative instruments that are undesignated and receive mark-to-market accounting, as well as cash flow hedges that offset sales contracts of various terms and lengths. Cash flow hedges relate to forecasted transactions that expire within the next four years.
Included in shareholders equity at December31, 2010, within accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) is a net after-tax gain of $72.3million associated with these contracts. A net gain of $44.6million is expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12months, the majority of which will be offset by pricing changes in sales and purchase contracts, thus resulting in little or no earnings impact to Ball.
Most metal food and household products packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include provisions permitting Ball to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, Ball recorded a pretax charge of $11.5million for mark-to-market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments, which were no longer deemed highly effective for hedge accounting purposes. These losses were largely recovered in 2009 through customer contracts.
Interest Rate Risk Balls objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, Ball may use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December31, 2010, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments.
At December31, 2010, the company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $259million paying fixed rates expiring within the next two years. An approximate $0.2million net after-tax gain associated with these contracts is included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) at December31, 2010, the majority of which is expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12months. The value of these contracts in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December31, 2010, was insignificant.
Page 73 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 18.
Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued) Inflation risk Ball also uses inflation option contracts in Europe to limit the impacts from spikes in inflation against certain multi-year contracts. At December31, 2010, the company had inflation options in Europe with notional amounts of $152million. These options are undesignated for hedge accounting purposes and receive mark-to-market accounting. The fair value at December31, 2010, was $0.3million and the option contracts expire within the next three years.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Balls objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition, at times Ball manages foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys net earnings. Balls foreign currency translation risk results from the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Serbian dinar. Ball faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. At December31, 2010, the company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts and option collar contracts with notional amounts totaling $708million. Approximately $0.1million of net loss related to these contracts is included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December31, 2010, of which $0.9million of net loss is expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12months. The contracts outstanding at December31, 2010, expire within the next three years.
Collateral Calls The companys agreements with its financial counterparties require Ball to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark-to-market value of the contracts exceeds specified levels. Additionally, Ball has collateral posting arrangements with certain customers on these derivative contracts. The cash flows of the margin calls are shown within the investing section of the companys consolidated statements of cash flows. As of December31, 2010, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position was $26.3million and no collateral was required to be posted. As of December31, 2009, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position was $98.8million collateralized by $14.2million, which was offset by cash collateral receipts from customers of $14.2million. If the companys public credit rating was downgraded, there would be a net increase of $0.9million to our net cash collateral postings as of December31, 2010.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued) Fair Value Measurements Ball has classified all applicable financial derivative assets and liabilities as Level2 within the fair value hierarchy as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and presented those values in the table below. The companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

Option contracts are valued using a Black-Scholes model with observable market inputs for aluminum, currency and interest rates. We do not obtain multiple quotes to determine the value for our financial instruments, as we value each of our financial instruments either internally using a single valuation technique or from a reliable observable market source. The company also does not adjust the value of its financial instruments except in determining the fair value of a trade that settles in the future by discounting the value to its present value using 12-month LIBOR as the discount factor. Ball performs validations of our internally derived fair values reported for our financial instruments on a quarterly basis utilizing counterparty valuation statements. The company additionally evaluates counterparty creditworthiness and, as of December31, 2010, has not identified any circumstances requiring that the reported values of our financial instruments be adjusted.
The companys investment in shares of DigitalGlobe was measured using Level1 inputs and amounted to $22.1million at December31, 2010, and $16.9million at December31, 2009. Additionally, net receivables related to the European scrap metal program totaling $11.7million at December31, 2010, and $11.2million at December31, 2009, were classified as Level2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Page 78 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 20.Subsidiary Guarantees of Debt As discussed in Note12, the companys senior notes payableare guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the companys material domesticsubsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support of the notes, are co-terminous with the terms of the respective note indentures and would require performance upon certain events of default referred to in the respective guarantees. The maximum potential amounts that could be required to be paid under the domestic guarantees are essentially equal to the then outstanding principal and interest under the respective notes.

86 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 21.Contingencies Ball issubject to numerous lawsuits, claims or proceedings arising out of the ordinary course ofbusiness, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and performance ofcompany products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of the company's business; tax reporting in domestic and foreign jurisdictions; workplace safety; and environmental and other matters. The company has also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. Some of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings involve substantial amounts, including as described below, and some ofthe environmental proceedings involve potential monetary costs or sanctions that may substantially exceed $100,000. Ball has denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. The company carries various forms of commercial, property and casualty, and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment againstBall with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. The company does not believe that these lawsuits, claims and proceedings are material individually or in the aggregate. Whilemanagement believes the company hasestablished adequate accruals forexpected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution ofany existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect onthe liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
In 2010, the company was served with a claim by Hess Corporation (Hess) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of NewYork. Hess alleges that the company and certain affiliates breached an agreement to purchase electricity from Hess related to Ball Plastic Container Corp.s former Baldwinsville, NewYork, plant. Based on the information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
As previously reported, in 2010 the companys Canadian subsidiary, Ball Packaging Products Canada Corp. (Ball Canada), was advised by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (the Ministry) that the Ministry would post, for public comment, a proposed Order under the Environmental Protection Act. The proposed Order would require Ball Canada to remediate areas that were allegedly contaminated by its predecessor company, Marathon Paper Mills of Canada Limited. That company operated a pulp mill on the north shore of Lake Superior for many years until it was sold to James River Company in 1983. Ball Canada continues to investigate whether the allegations in the proposed Order are correct and, if so, whether or not it has any liability or any recourse against other parties, including any former or subsequent owners or other parties associated with the pulp mill. Ball Canada has also engaged in discussions with the Ministry and two successor owners and/or operators of the pulp mill with a view to Ball Canada and such owners and/or operators settling all potential outstanding claims of the Ministry and any claims against one another and other interested parties. Subject to the results of such discussions, the company does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. In September 2010, the three companies and the Ministry reached a mediated agreement to retain an environmental consultant to risk assess the mill site with emphasis on the potential for containment of contamination, if any is found. A further mediation will likely occur during 2011 after the consultant completes its work, in order to determine the scope and cost split of any potential containment that may be recommended as part of an overall settlement among all parties, including the Ministry.
As previously reported, the company investigated potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Argentina, which came to our attention on or about October15, 2007. The Department of Justice and the SEC were also made aware of this matter, on or about the same date. The Department of Justice informed us in 2009 that it had completed its investigation and would not bring charges. The SECs staff has concluded its investigation and a resolution is expected during 2011. Based on our investigation to date, we do not believe this matter involved senior management or management or other employees who have significant roles in internal control over financial reporting.
Page 87 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 21.Contingencies (continued) As previously reported, in 2005 Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. (BMBCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was served with an amended complaint filed by Crown Packaging Technology, Inc. et.al. (Crown), in the U.S.District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division at Dayton, Ohio. The complaint alleges that the manufacture, sale and use of certain ends by BMBCC and its customers infringes certain claims of Crowns U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief. BMBCC has formally denied the allegations of the complaint. On September8, 2009, the District Court granted Balls motion for summary judgment holding that the asserted patent claims were invalid for failure to comply with the written description requirement and because they were anticipated by prior art. On October7, 2009, Crown filed its Notice of Appeal seeking to overturn the Trial Courts decision. The appellate court heard oral argument on the appeal on December8, 2010, and is expected to issue its decision during the first half of 2011. Based on the information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
As previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers the company a PRP with respect to the Lowry Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. In 1992, the company was served with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contributions from the company and approximately 38other companies. The company filed its answer denying the allegations of the complaint. Subsequently in 1992, the company was served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company, Inc., seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the allegations of the complaint.
Also in 1992, the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (collectively Waste Management) and Denver pursuant to which Waste Management and Denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company, and Waste Management agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the site. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to guarantee the obligations of Waste Management. Waste Management and Denver may seek additional payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed $319million. In 2003 Waste Management, Inc., indicated that the cost of the site might exceed $319million in 2030, approximately three years before the projected completion of the project. The company might also be responsible for payments (based on 1992 dollars) for any additional wastes that may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified after the execution of the settlement agreement. While remediating the site, contaminants were encountered, which could add an additional cleanup cost of approximately $10million. This additional cleanup cost could, in turn, add approximately $1million to total site costs for the PRP group.
At this time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively involved. Based on the information available to the company at this time, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
Page 88 of 100 Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 22.Indemnifications and Guarantees General Guarantees During the normal course of business, the company or its appropriate consolidated direct or indirect subsidiaries have made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which the specified entity may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities, commitments and guarantees include indemnities to the customers of the subsidiaries in connection with the sales of their packaging and aerospace products and services; guarantees to suppliers of subsidiaries of the company guaranteeing the performance of the respective entity under a purchase agreement, construction contract or other commitment; guarantees in respect of certain foreign subsidiaries pension plans; indemnities for liabilities associated with the infringement of third party patents, trademarks or copyrights under various types of agreements; indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility, equipment, furniture and other personal property leases for certain claims arising from such leases; indemnities to governmental agencies in connection with the issuance of a permit or license to the company or a subsidiary; indemnities pursuant to agreements relating to certain joint ventures; indemnities in connection with the sale of businesses or substantially all of the assets and specified liabilities of businesses; and indemnities to directors, officers and employees of the company to the extent permitted under the laws of the State of Indiana and the United States of America. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies and, in certain cases, is indefinite. In addition many of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential future payments the company could be obligated to make. As such, the company is unable to reasonably estimate its potential exposure under these items.
The company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The company does, however, accrue for payments under promissory notes and other evidences of incurred indebtedness and for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnifications, commitments and guarantees, when future payment is both reasonably estimable and probable. Finally, the company carries specific and general liability insurance policies and has obtained indemnities, commitments and guarantees from third party purchasers, sellers and other contracting parties, which the company believes would, in certain circumstances, provide recourse to any claims arising from these indemnifications, commitments and guarantees.
Debt Guarantees The companys senior notes and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the companys material domestic subsidiaries and the domestic subsidiary borrowers, and obligations of the subsidiary borrowers under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by the company. Loans borrowed under the senior credit facilities by foreign subsidiary borrowers are also effectively guaranteed by certain of the companys foreign subsidiaries by pledges of stock of the foreign subsidiary borrowers and stock of material foreign subsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support of the notes and credit facilities referred to above, are co-terminous with the terms of the respective note indentures and credit agreements and would require performance upon certain events of default referred to in the respective guarantees. The maximum potential amounts which could be required to be paid under the domestic guarantees are essentially equal to the then outstanding principal and interest under the respective notes and credit agreements, or under the applicable tranche, and the maximum potential amounts that could be required to be paid under the foreign stock pledges by foreign subsidiaries are essentially equal to the value of the stock pledged. The company is not in default under the above notes or credit facilities. Note20 contains the condensed consolidating financial information for the company, segregating the guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries. Separate financial statements for the guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries are not presented, because management has determined that such financial statements would not be material to investors.
