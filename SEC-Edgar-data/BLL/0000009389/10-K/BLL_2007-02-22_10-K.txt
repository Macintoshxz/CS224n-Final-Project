(1)                Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any                series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,                the holders of shares of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock                shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors                out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in                cash on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year (each                such date being referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment                Date), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the                first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of SeriesA Junior                Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest                cent) equal to the greater of (a)$0.01 or (b)subject to the                provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per                share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share                amount (payable in kind) of all noncash dividends or other distributions other                than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the                outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared                on the Common Stock, without par value, of the Corporation (the Common                Stock) since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,                or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first                issuance of any share or fraction of a share of SeriesA Junior                Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time                after January24, 1996 (the Rights Declaration Date)                (a)declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (b)subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (c)combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b)of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(2)                The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the SeriesA                Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (1) above                immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock                (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the                event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock                during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next                subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $0.01 per share on the                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable                on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
(3)                Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend                Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of SeriesA                Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is                prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which                case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of                such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or                is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a                quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of                which event such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such                Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear                interest. Dividends paid on the shares of SeriesA Junior Participating                Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the                time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a                share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of                Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment                of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no                more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
(B)Voting Rights. The holders of shares of SeriesA Junior Participating                Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (1) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder                thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of                the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights                Declaration Date (a)declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares                of Common Stock, (b)subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or                (c)combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,                then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares                of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately                prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction                the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding                immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of                shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(2)                Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of                Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote                of shareholders of the Corporation.
(3)                     (a)If at any time dividends on any SeriesA Junior Participating           Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly           dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning           of a period (herein called a default period) which shall extend           until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly           dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of           SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have           been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all           holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the SeriesA Junior           Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to           six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series,           shall have the right to elect two (2) directors.
(b)During any default period, such voting right of the holders of SeriesA                Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special                meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (3)(c) of this Section(B) or at                any annual meeting of shareholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of                shareholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the                holders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain                cases, the authorized number of directors shall be exercised unless the holders                of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be                present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common                Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such                voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall                exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they                shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such                vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two (2)                directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2)                directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not                amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the                right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to                permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of the                Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any                default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of                directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of                Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity                securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the SeriesA Junior                Participating Preferred Stock.
(c)Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period,           have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the Board of Directors           may order, or any shareholder or shareholders owning in the aggregate not less           than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock           outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special           meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be           called by the President, a Vice President or the Corporate Secretary of the           Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders           of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this subparagraph (3)(c)           shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of           such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the           Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days           and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the           calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting           may be called on similar notice by any shareholder or shareholders owning in the           aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of           Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph           (3)(c), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days           immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of           shareholders.
(d)In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock                of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the                whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have                exercised their right to elect two (2) directors voting as a class, after the                exercise of which right (x)the directors so elected by the holders of                Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been                elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y)                any vacancy in the Board of Directors may, except as provided in subparagraph                (3)(b) of this Section(B), be filled by vote of a majority of the                remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock                which elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References in                this paragraph (3) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of                stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as                provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
(e)Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x)the right of the                holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease,                (y)the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as                a class shall terminate, and (z)the number of directors shall be such                number as may be provided for in these Amended Articles or the Bylaws                irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph                (3)(b) of this Section(B) (such number being subject, however, to change                thereafter in any manner provided by law or in these Amended Articles or the                Bylaws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of                clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the                remaining directors.
(4)                Except as set forth herein, holders of SeriesA Junior Participating                Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not                be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of                Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
(C)           Certain Restrictions.
(1)                Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the                SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in                Section(A) are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid                dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of SeriesA                Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full,                the Corporation shall not: (a)declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or                purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking                junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)                to the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock; (b)declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of                stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,                dissolution or winding up) with the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred                Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the SeriesA Junior Participating                Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in                arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such                shares are then entitled; (c)redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock                ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or                winding up) with the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock,                provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise                acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of                the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution,                liquidation or winding up) to the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred                Stock; or (d)purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of SeriesA                Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity                with the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in                accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as                determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such                terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual                dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective                series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and                equitable treatment among the respective series of classes.
(2) The Corporation                shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (1) of this Section(C), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
(D)Reacquired Shares. Any shares of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred                Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner                whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition                thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but                unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series                of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of                Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth                herein.
(E)                Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
(1)                Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the                Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock                ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or                winding up) to the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless,                prior thereto, the holders of shares of SeriesA Junior Participating                Preferred Stock shall have received $1,000 per share, plus an amount equal to                accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared,                to the date of such payment (the SeriesA Liquidation                Preference). Following the payment of the full amount of the SeriesA                Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders                of shares of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior                thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per                share (the Common Adjustment) equal to the quotient obtained by                dividing (a)the SeriesA Liquidation Preference by (b)1,000 (as                appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (3) below to reflect such                events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to                the Common Stock) (such number in clause (c), the Adjustment                Number). Following the payment of the full amount of the SeriesA                Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect to all outstanding                shares of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock,                respectively, holders of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock and                holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate                share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment                Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per                share basis, respectively.
(2)                In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit                payment in full of the SeriesA Liquidation Preference and the liquidation                preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a                parity with the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such                remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity                shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event,                however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in                full of the Common adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed                ratably to the holders of Common Stock.
(3)                In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date                (a)declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock,                (b)subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (c)combine the                outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case                the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be                adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of                which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such                event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that                were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(F)Consolidation, Merger, etc.In case the Corporation shall enter into any                consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of                Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash                and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of SeriesA                Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly                exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for                adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of                stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case                may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or                exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights                Declaration Date (a)declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares                of Common Stock, (b)subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or                (c)combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,                then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with                respect to the exchange or change of shares of SeriesA Junior                Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a                fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock                outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the                number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such                event.
(G)Redemption.The shares of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock                shall be redeemable at a price equal to the product of (a)the current                market price of the Common Stock and (b)the Adjustment Number.
(H)RankingThe SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank                junior to all other series of the Corporations Preferred Stock as to the                payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any                such series shall provide otherwise.
(I)Amendment.The Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be                further amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,                preferences or special rights of the SeriesA Junior Participating                Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of                the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of SeriesA                Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
(J)Fractional Shares.SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be                issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to                such holders fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive                dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other                rights of holders of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
4.           (Added by amendment on June29, 1989) Two million one hundred thousand (2,100,000) shares of Preferred Stock shall be designated as SeriesB ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock and shall have preferences, limitations, and relative voting and other rights as follows: Section1. Designation and Amount; Special Purpose Restricted Transfer Issue (A)                The shares of such series shall be designated SeriesB ESOP                Convertible Preferred Stock (such series being hereinafter sometimes                called the SeriesB Preferred Stock), and the number of shares                constituting such series shall initially be 2,100,000. Each share of                SeriesB Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $36.75.
(B)Shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be issued only to Mellon Bank,                N.A., as trustee (the Trustee) of the Ball Corporation Salary                Conversion Plan for Salaried Employees, as amended from time to time, or any                successor to such plan (the Plan), including the employee stock                ownership plan component of the Plan (the ESOP). All references to                the holder of the SeriesB Preferred Stock shall mean the Trustee or any                corporation with which or into which the Trustee may merge or any successor                trustee under the trust agreement with respect to the Plan. In the event of any                transfer of record ownership of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock to any                person other than any successor trustee under the Plan, the shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any                further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof, shall be automatically                converted into shares of Common Stock (as defined in paragraph (B) of                Section11 hereof) on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to                Section5 hereof and no such transferee shall have any of the voting                powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or special rights                ascribed to shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only                the powers and rights pertaining to the Common Stock into which such shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be so converted. In the event of such a                conversion, the transferee of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall                be treated for all purposes as the record holder of the shares of Common Stock                into which such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock have been automatically                converted as of the date of such transfer. Certificates representing shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock shall bear a legend to reflect the foregoing                provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (B) of                Section1, shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock (i)may be                converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by Section5 hereof and                the shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion may be transferred by the                holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii)shall be redeemable by the                Corporation upon the terms and conditions provided by Sections6, 7 and 8                hereof.
Section2. Dividends and Distributions (A)Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holders of                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as                and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board of                Directors) out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends                (Preferred Dividends) at the rate of $2.76 per share per annum,                payable semiannually in arrears, one-half on the 15th day of December and                one-half on the 15th day of June of each year (each a Dividend Payment                Date) commencing on December15, 1989, to holders of record at the                start of business on such Dividend Payment Date. In the event that any Dividend                Payment Date shall fall on any day other than a Business Day (as                defined in paragraph (G) of Section9 hereof), the dividend payment due on                such Dividend Payment Date shall be paid on the Business Day immediately                following such Dividend Payment Date. Preferred Dividends shall begin to accrue                on outstanding shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock from the date of issuance                of such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock. Preferred Dividends shall                accrue on a daily basis whether or not during such semiannual period there shall                be funds legally available therefor, but Preferred Dividends accrued on the                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock for any period less than a full                semiannual period between Dividend Payment Dates (or, in the case of the first                dividend payment, from the date of issuance of the shares of SeriesB                Preferred Stock through the first Dividend Payment Date) shall be computed on                the basis of a 360-day year of 30-day months. Accrued but unpaid Preferred                Dividends shall cumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first                become payable, but no interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid Preferred                Dividends.
(B)So long as any shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, no                dividend shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any other series                of stock ranking on a parity with the SeriesB Preferred Stock as to                dividends, unless there shall also be or have been declared and paid or set                apart for payment on the SeriesB Preferred Stock dividends for all                dividend payment periods of the SeriesB Preferred Stock ending on or                before the dividend payment date of such parity stock, ratably in proportion to                the respective amounts of dividends accumulated and unpaid through such dividend                period on the SeriesB Preferred Stock and accumulated and unpaid on such                parity stock through the dividend payment period on such parity stock next                preceding such dividend payment date. In the event that full cumulative                dividends on the SeriesB Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid                or set apart for payment when due, the Corporation shall not declare or pay or                set apart for payment any dividends or make any other distributions on, or make                any payment on account of the purchase, redemption or other retirement of any                other class of stock or series thereof of the Corporation ranking, as to                dividends or as to distributions in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or                winding up of the Corporation, junior to the SeriesB Preferred Stock until                full cumulative dividends on the SeriesB Preferred Stock shall have been                paid or declared and set apart for payment; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i)any dividend payable solely                in any shares of any stock ranking, as to dividends and as to distributions in                the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, junior                to the SeriesB Preferred Stock or (ii)the acquisition of shares of                any stock ranking, as to dividends or as to distributions in the event of a                liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, junior to the                SeriesB Preferred Stock in exchange solely for shares of any other stock                ranking, as to dividends and as to distributions in the event of a liquidation,                dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, junior to the SeriesB                Preferred Stock.
Section3. Voting Rights The holders of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (A)The holders of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote                on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation,                voting together with the holders of Common Stock as one class. The holders of                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock initially shall be entitled to 1.30                votes per share (the Initial Vote), provided in the event of                a Regulatory Determination, as defined below, with respect to the                Initial Vote, the Initial Vote shall be reduced to one vote per share. In the                event that the Conversion Price, as defined in Section5                hereof, is adjusted as provided in Subsection 9(A) or (B) hereof, each share of                SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a vote equal to the vote to                which it was entitled immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by the                inverse of the fraction by which the Conversion Price is to be multiplied                pursuant to such subsection, subject to a Regulatory Determination. In the event                of any other adjustment to the Conversion Price hereunder, each share of                SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a number of votes equal to                the higher of (i)the number of shares of Common Stock into which such                share of SeriesB Preferred Stock could be converted subsequent to such                adjustment and (ii)the number of votes to which it was entitled                immediately prior to such adjustment, subject to a Regulatory Determination. In                the event of a Regulatory Determination with respect to the voting rights of a                share of SeriesB Preferred Stock as adjusted pursuant to the preceding two                sentences, the number of votes per share of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall                only be adjusted to the highest vote per share which would not result in a                Regulatory Determination. The term Regulatory Determination refers                to a determination by the Corporation that the number of votes to be accorded to                each share of SeriesB Preferred Stock hereunder would create a material                risk that the Common Stock would no longer be eligible for trading on the                NewYork Stock Exchange (NYSE) or otherwise not be permitted by                applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or                the NYSE.
(B)Except as otherwise required by law or set forth herein, holders of                SeriesB Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their                consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote                with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for the taking of any                corporate action.
Section4. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up (A)In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,                voluntary or involuntary, the holders of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be                entitled to receive out of assets of the Corporation which remain after                satisfaction in full of all valid claims of creditors of the Corporation and                which are available for payment to shareholders, and subject to the rights of                the holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking senior to or on a parity                with the SeriesB Preferred Stock in respect of distributions upon                liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, before any amount                shall be paid to or distributed among the holders of Common Stock or any other                shares ranking junior to the SeriesB Preferred Stock in respect of                distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,                liquidating distributions in the amount of $36.75 per share, plus an amount                equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for                distribution, and no more. If upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of                the Corporation, the amounts payable with respect to the SeriesB Preferred                Stock and any other stock ranking as to any such distribution on a parity with                the SeriesB Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the holders of                SeriesB Preferred Stock and such other stock shall share ratably in any                distribution of assets in proportion to the full respective preferential amounts                to which they are entitled. After payment of the full amount to which they are                entitled as provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 4(A), the                holders of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further                right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
(B)Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other                corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation with or                into the Corporation, nor the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or                any portion of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a                dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation for                purposes of this Section4, but the holders of SeriesB Preferred                Stock shall nevertheless be entitled in the event of any such merger or                consolidation to the rights provided by Section8 hereof.
(C)Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or                winding up of the Corporation, stating the payment date or dates when, and the                place or places where, the amounts distributable to holders of SeriesB                Preferred Stock in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by hand                delivery, by courier, by standard form of telecommunication or by first-class                mail (postage prepaid), delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may be, not less                than twenty (20) days prior to any payment date stated therein, to the holders                of SeriesB Preferred Stock, at the address shown on the books of the                Corporation or any transfer agent for the SeriesB Preferred Stock.
Section5. Conversion into Common Stock (A)A holder of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be entitled, at any                time prior to the close of business on the date fixed for redemption of such                shares pursuant to Section6, 7 or 8 hereof, to cause any or all of such                shares to be converted into shares of Common Stock, initially at a conversion                price equal to $36.75 per share of Common Stock, with each share of                SeriesB Preferred Stock being valued at $36.75 for such purpose, and which                price shall be adjusted as provided in Section9 hereof (and, as so                adjusted, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Conversion                Price) (that is, a conversion rate initially equivalent to one share of                Common Stock for each share of SeriesB Preferred Stock so converted,                subject to adjustment as the Conversion Price is adjusted as provided in Section                9 hereof).
(B)Any holder of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock desiring to convert such                shares into shares of Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or                certificates representing the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock being                converted, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer to the Corporation (or                accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto), at the principal                executive office of the Corporation or the offices of any transfer agent for the                SeriesB Preferred Stock or such office or offices in the continental                United States of an agent for conversion as may from time to time be designated                by notice to the holders of the SeriesB Preferred Stock by the Corporation                or any transfer agent for the SeriesB Preferred Stock, accompanied by                written notice of conversion. Such notice of conversion shall specify                (i)the number of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock to be converted                and the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or                certificates for Common Stock and for any shares of SeriesB Preferred                Stock not to be so converted to be issued and (ii)the address to which                such holder wishes new certificates issued upon such conversion to be delivered.
(C)Upon surrender of a certificate representing a share or shares of SeriesB                Preferred Stock for conversion, the Corporation shall issue and send by hand                delivery, by courier or by first-class mail (postage prepaid), to the holder                thereof or to such holders designee, at the address designated by such                holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock                to which such holder shall be entitled upon conversion. In the event that there                shall have been surrendered a certificate or certificates representing shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be converted, the                Corporation shall issue and send to such holder or such holders designee,                in the manner set forth in the preceding sentence, a new certificate or                certificates representing the number of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock                which shall not have been converted.
(D)The issuance by the Corporation of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock made at the                option of the holder thereof shall be effective as of the earlier of                (i)the delivery to such holder or such holders designee of the                certificates representing the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion                thereof or (ii)the commencement of business on the second Business Day                after the surrender of the certificate or certificates for the shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock to be converted, duly assigned or endorsed for                transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers                relating thereto) and accompanied by all documentation required to effect the                conversion, as herein provided. On and after the effective date of conversion,                the person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such                conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of                such shares of Common Stock, but no allowance or adjustment shall be made in                respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock in respect of any period                prior to such effective date. The Corporation shall not be obligated to pay any                dividends which shall have been declared and shall be payable to holders of                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock on a Dividend Payment Date if such                Dividend Payment Date for such dividend is subsequent to the effective date of                conversion of such shares.
(E)The Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver to holders of SeriesB                Preferred Stock any fractional share or shares of Common Stock issuable upon any                conversion of such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock, but in lieu thereof                may make a cash payment in respect thereof in any manner permitted by law.
(F)Out of its authorized Common Stock the Corporation shall at all times reserve                and keep available unissued or treasury shares solely for issuance upon the                conversion of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock as herein provided, free                from any preemptive rights, in such number as shall from time to time be                issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock                then outstanding. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Corporation from                issuing shares of Common Stock held in its treasury upon the conversion of                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock into Common Stock pursuant to the terms                hereof. The Corporation shall prepare and shall use its best efforts to obtain                and keep in force such governmental or regulatory permits or other                authorizations as may be required by law, and shall comply with all requirements                as to registration or qualification of the Common Stock, in order to enable the                Corporation lawfully to issue and deliver to each holder of record of                SeriesB Preferred Stock such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall                from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock then outstanding and convertible into shares of                Common Stock.
Section6. Redemption At the Option of the Corporation (A)The SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in whole or in part,                (i)at the option of the Corporation at any time after June29, 1999,                at $36.75 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends                thereon to the date fixed for redemption and (ii)as otherwise permitted by                this Section6. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by the                Corporation in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, as                permitted by paragraph (F) of this Section6. From and after the date fixed                for redemption, dividends on shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock called for                redemption will cease to accrue, such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock                will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights in respect of such                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall cease, except the right to receive                the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall either                redeem a portion of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock of each holder                determined pro rata based on the number of shares of SeriesB Preferred                Stock held by each holder or shall select the shares of SeriesB Preferred                Stock to be redeemed by lot, as may be determined by the Board of Directors.
(B)Unless otherwise required by law, notice of redemption will be sent to the                holders of SeriesB Preferred Stock at the address shown on the books of                the Corporation or any transfer agent for the SeriesB Preferred Stock by                hand delivery, by courier, by any standard form of telecommunications or by                first-class mail (postage prepaid), delivered, sent or mailed, as the case may                be, not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the                redemption date. Each such notice shall state: (i)the redemption date;                (ii)the total number of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock to be                redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be                redeemed, the number of such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock to be                redeemed from such holder; (iii)the redemption price; (iv)the place                or places where certificates for such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock                are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v)that                dividends on the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock to be redeemed will                cease to accrue on such redemption date; and (vi)the conversion rights of                the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the period within                which conversion rights may be exercised, and the Conversion Price and number of                shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of SeriesB                Preferred Stock at the time. Upon surrender of the certificate for any shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock so called for redemption and not previously                converted (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors                shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed                by the Corporation at the date fixed for redemption and at the redemption price                set forth in this Section6.
(C)In the event (i)of a change in any statute, rule or regulation of the                United States of America which (x)has the effect of limiting or making                unavailable to the Corporation all or any of the tax deductions for amounts paid                (including dividends) on the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock when such                amounts are used as provided under Section404(k)(2) of the Internal                Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on the date shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock are initially issued, or (y) relates, directly or                indirectly, to the ESOP and adversely affects the Corporation, (ii)that                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are held by an employee benefit plan                intended to qualify as an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of                Section4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the                Code), and such plan does not so qualify, or (iii)that the                Corporation, in good faith after consultation with counsel to the Corporation,                determines that the voting provisions contained herein are not in compliance                with Rule 19c-4 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the                Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Corporation may, in its sole                discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (A) of this                Section6, elect to redeem any or all of such shares of SeriesB                Preferred Stock for $36.75 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and                unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption. Except with respect                to the redemption price, such redemption shall be effected as provided in                paragraphs (A), (B) and (F) of this Section6.
(D)In the event that the Plan is terminated or the ESOP is terminated or eliminated                from the Plan in accordance with its terms, and notwithstanding anything to the                contrary in paragraph (A) of this Section6, the Corporation shall, as soon                thereafter as practicable, call for redemption all then outstanding shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock at the following redemption prices per share: During the Twelve- Month Period Beginning June 29 Price Per Share 1989 $ 39.510 1990 39.234 1991 38.958 1992 38.682 1993 38.406 1994 38.130 1995 37.854 1996 37.578 1997 37.302 1998 37.026 Except with respect to the redemption price, such redemption shall be effected as provided in paragraphs (A), (B) and (F) of this Section6.
(E)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (A) of this                Section6, upon the termination of a Plan participants employment                with the Corporation, the Corporation may elect to redeem any or all shares of                SeriesB Preferred Stock held for the account of such participant at a                redemption price equal to the higher of (i)$36.75 per share, plus an                amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for                redemption or (ii)the Fair Market Value (as defined in paragraph (G) of                Section9 hereof) of the shares of Common Stock which would be issuable                upon the conversion of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock being                redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (the Consideration                Price). Except with respect to the redemption price, such redemption shall                be effected as provided in paragraphs (A), (B) and (F) of this Section6.
(F)The Corporation, at its option, may make payment of the redemption price                required upon redemption of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock in cash or                in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of such shares and cash, any such                shares of Common Stock to be valued for such purposes at their Fair Market                Value.
Section7.

Section8. Consolidation, Merger, etc.
(A)                In the event that the Corporation shall consummate any consolidation or merger                or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of                Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed,                reclassified or converted solely into stock of any successor or resulting                corporation (including the Corporation) that constitutes qualifying                employer securities with respect to a holder of SeriesB Preferred                Stock within the meaning of Section409(1) of the Code and                Section407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,                as amended, or any successor provisions of law, and, if applicable, for a cash                payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any, the shares of SeriesB                Preferred Stock of such holder shall, in connection with such consolidation,                merger or similar business combination, be assumed by and shall become preferred                stock of such successor or resulting corporation, having in respect of such                corporation, insofar as possible, the same powers, preferences and relative,                participating, optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights                provided by Sections6, 7 and 8 hereof), and the qualifications,                limitations or restrictions thereon, that the SeriesB Preferred Stock had                immediately prior to such transaction, except that after such transaction each                share of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be convertible, otherwise on the                terms and conditions provided by Section5 hereof, into the number and kind                of qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of the number of                shares of Common Stock into which such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock                could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction; provided,                however, that if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of                Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind                of consideration to be received in such transaction, which election cannot                practicably be made by the holder of the shares of SeriesB Preferred                Stock, then the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such                transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be                converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash                or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of                shares of Common Stock into which such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock                could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder                of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election to receive any kind or                amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (other than such qualifying                employer securities and a cash payment, if applicable, in lieu of fractional                shares), receivable upon such transaction (provided that, if the kind or amount                of qualifying employer securities receivable upon such transaction is not the                same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount so receivable upon                such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so                receivable per share by the plurality of the non-electing shares). The rights of                the SeriesB Preferred Stock as preferred stock of such successor or                resulting corporation shall successively be subject to adjustments pursuant to                Sections3 and 9 hereof after any such transaction as nearly equivalent as                practicable to the adjustment provided for by such sections prior to such                transaction. The Corporation shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation                or similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of SeriesB                Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or resulting                corporation as aforesaid.
(B)                In the event that the Corporation shall consummate any consolidation or merger                or similar business combination, pursuant to which the outstanding shares of                Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or                converted into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any                combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (A) of this Section8) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Corporation or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (C) of this Section8), be automatically converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each share of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction; provided, however, that if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be made by the holder of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock, then the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction (provided that, if the kind or amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-electing share, then the kind and amount of stock, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares).
(C)                In the event the Corporation shall enter into any agreement providing for any                consolidation or merger or similar business combination described in paragraph                (B) of this Section8, then the Corporation shall as soon as practicable                thereafter (and in any event at least ten (10) Business Days before consummation                of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms                thereof to each holder of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock and each such                holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Corporation, to                receive, upon consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is                consummated), from the Corporation or the successor of the Corporation, in                redemption and retirement of such SeriesB Preferred Stock, a cash payment                equal to the following amount per share: During the Twelve- Month Period Beginning June 29 Price Per Share 1989 $ 39.510 1990 39.234 1991 38.958 1992 38.682 1993 38.406 1994 38.130 1995 37.854 1996 37.578 1997 37.302 1998 37.026 No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Corporation prior to the close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Corporation or the successor of the Corporation shall waive such prior notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Corporation prior to the close of business on the fifth business day prior to consummation of such transaction.
Section9. Anti-dilution Adjustments (A)                In the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any                of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are outstanding, (i)pay a                dividend or make a distribution in respect of the Common Stock in shares of                Common Stock, (ii)subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or                (iii)combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number                of shares, in each case whether by reclassification of shares, recapitalization                of the Corporation (including a recapitalization effected by a merger or                consolidation to which Section8 hereof does not apply) or otherwise,                subject to the provisions of paragraphs (E) and (F) of this Section9, the                Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted by                multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the                number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event, and                the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding                immediately after such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)                shall be given effect, upon payment of such a dividend or distribution, as of                the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such                dividend or distribution (on a retroactive basis) and in the case of a                subdivision or combination shall become effective immediately as of the                effective date thereof.
(B)                In the event that the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while                any of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue to                holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution, including by                way of a reclassification of shares or a recapitalization of the Corporation,                any right or warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock (but not including as                such a right or warrant any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares                of Common Stock) at a purchase price per share less than the Fair Market Value                (as defined in paragraph (G) of this Section9) of a share of Common Stock                on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then, subject to paragraphs                (E) and (F) of this Section9, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by                multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be                the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such                issuance of rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which                could be purchased at the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the                time of such issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon                exercise in full of all such rights or warrants, and the denominator of which                shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before                such issuance of rights or warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common                Stock that could be acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and                warrants.
(C)                In the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any                of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue, sell or                exchange shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to any right or warrant to                purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock [including as such a right or warrant                any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock] and                other than pursuant to any employee or director incentive or benefit plan or                arrangement, including any employment, severance or consulting agreement, of the                Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation heretofore or hereafter                adopted) for a consideration having a Fair Market Value, on the date of such                issuance, sale or exchange, less than the Fair Market Value of such shares on                the date of issuance, sale or exchange, then, subject to paragraphs (E) and (F)                of this Section9, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying                such Conversion Price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the sum of                (i)the Fair Market Value of all the shares of Common Stock outstanding on                the day immediately preceding the first public announcement of such issuance,                sale or exchange plus (ii)the Fair Market Value of the consideration                received by the Corporation in respect of such issuance, sale or exchange of                shares of Common Stock, and the denominator of which shall be the product of                (a)the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the day immediately                preceding the first public announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange                multiplied by (b)the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock                outstanding on such day plus the number of shares of Common Stock so issued,                sold or exchanged by the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall, at any                time or from time to time while any shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are                outstanding, issue, sell or exchange any right or warrant to purchase or acquire                shares of Common Stock (including as such a right or warrant any security                convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock), other than any                such issuance to holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution                (including by way of a reclassification of shares or a recapitalization of the                Corporation) and other than pursuant to any employee or director incentive or                benefit plan or arrangement (including any employment, severance or consulting                agreement) of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation heretofore or                hereafter adopted, for a consideration having a Fair Market Value, on the date                of such issuance, sale or exchange, less than the Non-Dilutive Amount (as hereinafter defined), then, subject to paragraphs (E) and (F) of this Section9, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the sum of (i)the Fair Market Value of all the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the day immediately preceding the first public announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange plus (ii)the Fair Market Value of the consideration received by the Corporation in respect of such issuance, sale or exchange of such right or warrant plus (iii)the Fair Market Value at the time of such issuance of the consideration which the Corporation would receive upon exercise in full of all such rights or warrants, and the denominator of which shall be the product of (i)the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the day immediately preceding the first public announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange multiplied by (ii)the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such day plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which could be acquired pursuant to such right or warrant at the time of the issuance, sale or exchange of such right or warrant (assuming shares of Common Stock could be acquired pursuant to such right or warrant at such time).
(D)                In the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any                of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are outstanding, make an                Extraordinary Distribution (as defined in paragraph (G) of this Section9)                in respect of the Common Stock, whether by dividend, distribution,                reclassification of shares or recapitalization of the Corporation (including a                recapitalization or reclassification effected by a merger or consolidation to                which Section8 hereof does not apply) or effect a Pro Rata Repurchase (as                defined in paragraph (G) of this Section9) of Common Stock, the Conversion                Price in effect immediately prior to such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata                Repurchase shall, subject to paragraphs (E) and (F) of this Section9, be                adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction the numerator of                which is the difference between (i)the product of (x)the number of                shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary                Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase multiplied by (y) the Fair Market Value of a                share of Common Stock on the day before the ex-dividend date with respect to an                Extraordinary Distribution which is paid in cash and on the distribution date                with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution which is paid other than in cash,                or on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any                tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or on the date of purchase with                respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may                be, and (ii)the Fair Market Value of the Extraordinary Distribution or the                aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, as the case may be, and the                denominator of which shall be the product of (a)the number of shares of                Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Dividend or Pro                Rata Repurchase minus, in the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase, the number of                shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Corporation multiplied by (b)the                Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the day before the ex-dividend                date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution which is paid in cash and on                the distribution date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution which is                paid other than in cash, or on the applicable expiration date (including all                extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase or on the                date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender                offer, as the case may be. The Corporation shall send each holder of                SeriesB Preferred Stock (i)notice of its intent to make any dividend                or distribution and (ii)notice of any offer by the Corporation to make a                Pro Rata Repurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as practicable                after, such offer is first communicated (including by announcement of a record                date in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common                Stock is listed or admitted to trading) to holders of Common Stock; provided, the Corporation shall give such holders notice of any dividend or                distribution no later than the date upon which it is required to give notice to                any stock exchange, or in the event notice to any stock exchange is not                required, no later than ten days before the applicable record date. Such notice                shall indicate the intended record date and the amount and nature of such                dividend or distribution, or the number of shares subject to such offer for a                Pro Rata Repurchase and the purchase price payable by the Corporation pursuant                to such offer, as well as the Conversion Price and the number of shares of                Common Stock into which a share of SeriesB Preferred Stock may be                converted at such time.
(E)                Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section9, the Corporation                shall not be required to make any adjustment to the Conversion Price unless such                adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in                the Conversion Price. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall                be made no later than the time of, and together with, the next subsequent                adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried                forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in                the Conversion Price.
(F)                If the Corporation shall make any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock                or issue any Common Stock, other capital stock or other security of the                Corporation or any rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such security,                which transaction does not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price                pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section9, the Board of                Directors of the Corporation shall consider whether such action is of such a                nature that an adjustment to the Conversion Price should equitably be made in                respect of such transaction. If in such case the Board of Directors of the                Corporation determines that an adjustment to the Conversion Price should be                made, an adjustment shall be made effective as of such date, as determined by                the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The determination of the Board of                Directors of the Corporation as to whether an adjustment to the Conversion Price                should be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (F), and,                if so, as to what adjustment should be made and when, shall be final and binding                on the Corporation and all shareholders of the Corporation. The Corporation                shall be entitled to make such additional adjustments in the Conversion Price,                in addition to those required by the foregoing provisions of this                Section9, as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution                in shares of capital stock of the Corporation, subdivision, reclassification or                combination of shares of stock of the Corporation or any recapitalization of the                Corporation shall not be taxable to the holders of the Common Stock.
(G)                For purposes of this amendment to the Amended Articles of Incorporation, the                following definitions shall apply: Business Day shall mean each day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which state or federally chartered banking institutions in NewYork, NewYork, are not required to be open.
Current Market Price of publicly  traded shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or other security of the Corporation or any other issuer for any day shall mean the last reported sales price, regular way, or, in the event that no sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the NewYork Stock Exchange Composite Tape or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on the NewYork Stock Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on the National Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) or, if such security is not quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on each such day in the over-the-counter market as reported by NASDAQ or, if bid and asked prices for such security on each such day shall not have been reported through NASDAQ, the average of the bid and asked prices for such day as furnished by any NewYork Stock Exchange member firm regularly making a market in such security selected for such purpose by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a committee thereof, in each case, on each trading day during the Adjustment Period.
Adjustment Period shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive trading days preceding, and including, the date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of any security which is not publicly traded or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof as determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good faith by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, or, if no such investment banking or appraisal firm is in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or such committee available to make such determination, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or such committee.
Extraordinary  Distribution  shall mean any dividend or other distribution to holders of Common Stock (effected while any of the shares of the SeriesB Preferred Stock are outstanding) (i)of cash where the aggregate amount of such cash dividend or distribution together with the amount of all cash dividends and distributions made during the preceding period of 12 months, when combined with the aggregate amount of all Pro Rata Repurchases (for this purpose, including only that portion of the aggregate purchase price of such Pro Rata Repurchase which is in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock repurchased as determined on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer or exchange offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or the date of purchase with respect to any other Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer or exchange offer made during such period), exceeds twelve and one-half percent (12%) of the aggregate Fair Market Value of all shares of Common Stock outstanding on the day before the ex-dividend date with respect to such Extraordinary Distribution which is paid in cash and on the distribution date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution which is paid other than in cash; provided, that in no event shall a regularly scheduled quarterly dividend not exceeding 125% of the average quarterly dividend for the four quarters immediately preceding such dividend constitute an Extraordinary Distribution resulting in an adjustment of the Conversion Price hereunder, and/or (ii)of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than shares of Common Stock), other securities of the Corporation (other than securities of the type referred to in paragraph (B) or (C) of this Section9), evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or any other person or any other property (including shares of any subsidiary of the Corporation) or any combination thereof. The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary Distribution for purposes of paragraph (D) of this Section9 shall be equal to the sum of the Fair Market Value of such Extraordinary Distribution plus the amount of any cash dividends (other than regularly scheduled dividends not exceeding 125% of the aggregate quarterly dividends for the preceding period of 12 months) which are not Extraordinary Distributions made during such 12-month period and not previously included in the calculation of an adjustment pursuant to paragraph (D) of this Section9.
Fair Market Value shall mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Corporation or any other issuer which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices of such shares or securities for each day of the Adjustment Period.
Non-Dilutive Amount in  respect of any  issuance,  sale or  exchange  by the Corporation of any right or warrant to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock (including any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) shall mean the difference between (i)the product of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the day preceding the first public announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange multiplied by the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which could be acquired on such date upon the exercise in full of such rights and warrants (including upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible or exchangeable securities), whether or not exercisable (or convertible or exchangeable) at such date, and (ii)the aggregate amount payable pursuant to such right or warrant to purchase or acquire such maximum number of shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that in no event shall the Non-Dilutive Amount be less than zero. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, in the case of a security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, the amount payable pursuant to a right or warrant to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock shall be the Fair Market Value of such security on the date of the issuance, sale or exchange of such security by the Corporation.
Pro Rata Repurchase shall mean any purchase of shares of Common Stock by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, whether for cash, shares of capital stock of the Corporation, other securities of the Corporation, evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or any other person or any other property (including shares of a subsidiary of the Corporation), or any combination thereof, effected while any of the shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are outstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer subject to Section13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or any successor provision of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to substantially all holders of Common Stock, other than any such purchase effected prior to June29, 1989; provided, however, that no purchase of shares by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof made in open market transactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata Repurchase. For purposes of this paragraph (G) of this Section9, shares shall be deemed to have been purchased by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof in open market transactions if they have been purchased substantially in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in effect under the Exchange Act on the date shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock are initially issued by the Corporation, or on such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall have determined are reasonably designed to prevent such purchases from having a material effect on the trading market for the Common Stock.
(H)                In the event that the Board of Directors of the Corporation adjusts the number                of outstanding shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock in accordance with                Section3 hereof, then in lieu of any other adjustment to the Conversion                Price pursuant to this Section9, the Board of Directors of the Corporation                may make such other adjustments as they deem appropriate. The determination of                the Board of Directors of the Corporation as to whether an adjustment should be                made pursuant to the foregoing sentence of this paragraph (H), and, if so, as to                what adjustment should be made and when, shall be final and binding on the                Corporation and all shareholders of the Corporation.
(I)                Whenever an adjustment to the Conversion Price and the related voting rights of                SeriesB Preferred Stock is required pursuant to this Amendment, the                Corporation shall forthwith place on file with the transfer agent for the Common                Stock and the SeriesB Preferred Stock, and with the Secretary of the                Corporation, a statement signed by two officers of the Corporation stating the                adjusted Conversion Price determined as provided herein and the resulting                conversion ratio, and the voting rights (as appropriately adjusted), of the                SeriesB Preferred Stock. Such statement shall set forth in reasonable                detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason and the manner of                computing such adjustment, including any determination of Fair Market Value                involved in such computation. Promptly after each adjustment to the Conversion                Price and the related voting rights of the shares of the SeriesB Preferred                Stock, the Corporation shall mail a notice thereof and of the then prevailing                conversion ratio to each holder of shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock.
Section10. Ranking; Attributable Capital and Adequacy of Surplus; Retirement of Shares (A)                The SeriesB Preferred Stock shall rank senior to the Common Stock as to                the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation,                dissolution and winding up of the Corporation, and, unless otherwise provided in                the Amended Articles, as the same may be amended, or a Certificate of Amendment                relating to a subsequent series of Preferred Stock without par value, of the                Corporation, the SeriesB Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all series                of the Corporations Preferred Stock, without par value, as to the payment                of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or                winding up.
(B)                In addition to any vote of shareholders required by law or by Section3(B)                of this Amendment, the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding                shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock shall be required to increase the par                value of the Common Stock or otherwise increase the capital of the Corporation                allocable to the Common Stock for the purpose of the Indiana Business                Corporation Law (BCL) if, as a result thereof, the surplus of the                Corporation for purposes of the BCL would be less than the amount of Preferred                Dividends that would accrue on the then outstanding shares of SeriesB                Preferred Stock during the following three years.
(C)                Any shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by                reason of the conversion or redemption of such shares as herein provided, or                otherwise so acquired, shall be retired as shares of SeriesB Preferred                Stock and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred                Stock, without par value, of the Corporation, undesignated as to series, and may                thereafter be reissued as part of a new series of such Preferred Stock as                permitted by law.
Section11. Miscellaneous (A)                All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and all notices hereunder                shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of delivery thereof if by                hand delivery, by courier or by standard form of telecommunication or three (3)                Business Days after the mailing thereof if sent by registered mail (unless                first-class mail shall be specifically permitted for such notice under the terms                hereof) with postage prepaid, addressed: (i)if to the Corporation, to its                office at 345 South High Street, P.O. Box 2407, Muncie, Indiana 47302-0407                (Attention: General Counsel), or to the transfer agent for the SeriesB                Preferred Stock, or other agent of the Corporation designated as permitted                hereby or (ii)if to any holder of the SeriesB Preferred Stock or                Common Stock, as the case may be, to such holder at the address of such holder                as listed in the stock record books of the Corporation (which may include the                records of any transfer agent for the SeriesB Preferred Stock or Common                Stock, as the case may be) or (iii)to such other address as the                Corporation or any such holder, as the case may be, shall have designated by                notice similarly given.
