Business Ball       Corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in Indiana in 1922. Its       principal executive offices are located at 10Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield,       Colorado80021-2510. The terms "Ball," "the company," "we" and "our" as       used herein refer to Ball Corporation and its consolidated       subsidiaries.
Ball       is a       manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging, primarily for beverages and foods,       and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to government       and commercial customers.
Information       Pertaining to the BusinessoftheCompany The       company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized along       a       combination of product lines and geographic areas: (1) North American       metal beverage packaging, (2)North American metal food packaging,       (3)North American plastic packaging, (4)international packaging and       (5)aerospace and technologies. Prior periods required to be shown in this       Annual Report on Form10-K (Annual Report) have been conformed to the       current presentation.
A       substantial part of our North American and international packaging sales are       made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses, including       SABMiller and bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages and their       affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Sales to SABMiller       plc       and PepsiCo, Inc., represented 11percent and 10percent of Balls       consolidated net sales, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2005.       Additional details about sales to major customers are included in Note2 to       the consolidated financial statements, which can be found in Item8 of this       Annual Report (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).
North       American Packaging Segments Our       principal business in North America is the manufacture and sale of aluminum,       steel and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers, primarily for beverages       and foods. Packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily       based on quality, service and price. The North American packaging business       is       capital intensive, requiring significant investment in machinery and equipment.       Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, production volumes, labor,       transportation, utility and warehousing costs, as well as the availability       and       price of raw materials, such as aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other direct       materials. These raw materials are generally available from several sources       and       we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not       experiencing any shortages. We believe we have limited our exposure related       to       changes in the costs of aluminum, steel and plastic resin as a result of       (1)the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts       to pass through aluminum cost changes, as well as the use of derivative       instruments, (2)the inclusion of provisions in certain steel container       sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain       other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated       metal       costs and (3) the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container       sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes. In 2004 and 2005 we were       able to pass through the majority of steel surcharges levied by producers and       continually attempt to reduce manufacturing and other material costs as much       as       possible. While raw materials and energy sources, such as natural gas and       electricity, may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to       external factors, and the pass through of steel costs to our customers may       be       limited in some instances, we cannot predict the timing or effects, if any,       of       such occurrences on future operations.
Research       and development (R&D) efforts in the North American packaging segments are       directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic       beverage and food containers, as well as new uses for the current containers.       Other research and development efforts in these segments seek to improve       manufacturing efficiencies. During 2004 we completed our expansion of the Ball       Technology and Innovation Center located near Denver, Colorado. All of our       North       American R&D activities are now conducted in that facility.
Page           1 of           97 North       American Metal Beverage Packaging North       American metal beverage packaging represents Balls largest segment, accounting       for 42percent of consolidated net sales in 2005. Decorated two-piece       aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16manufacturing facilities in the       U.S. and one each in Canada and Puerto Rico. Can ends are produced within four       of the U.S. facilities, as well as in a fifth facility that manufactures only       ends. Metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply       contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other       beverages. Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend       to       be highest during the period from April through September.
Through       Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture, which is accounted       for as an equity investment, Ball and Coors Brewing Company (Coors), a wholly       owned subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company, operatebeverage can and       end manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado. The joint venture supplies       Coors with beverage cans and ends for its Golden, Colorado, and Memphis,       Tennessee, breweries and supplies ends to its Shenandoah, Virginia, filling       location. Ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under       agreements with the joint venture. In addition to beverage containers supplied       to Coors from the joint venture, Ball supplies, from its own facilities,       substantially all of Coors metal container requirements for its Shenandoah,       Virginia, filling location, as well as other containers not manufactured by       the       joint venture.
Based       on       publicly available industry information, we estimate that our North American       metal beverage container shipments in 2005 of approximately 32billion cans       were approximately 31percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments of metal       beverage containers. Three producers manufacture substantially all of the       remaining metal beverage containers. Two of these producers and three other       independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in Mexico.       Available information indicates that North American metal beverage container       shipments have been relatively flat during the past several years.
Beverage       container production capacity in the U.S., Canada and Mexico exceeds demand.       In       order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business, from       time       to time we consolidate our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer, more       efficient facilities. We also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the       changes in customer demand for our packaging products. To that end, during       the       second quarter of 2005 we completed the conversion of a beverage can       manufacturing line in our Golden, Colorado, plant from the production of       12-ounce beverage cans to 24-ounce beverage cans.In the fourth quarter of       2005 we began the conversion of a line in our Monticello, Indiana, plant from       12-ounce can manufacturing to a line capable of producing beverage cans in       sizes       up to 16ounces. The Monticello conversion was substantially completed       during January 2006. During 2005 Ball commenced a project to upgrade and       streamline its North American beverage can end manufacturing capabilities,       a       project expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced       manufacturing costs. In connection with these activities, the company recorded       a       pretax charge of $19.3million ($11.7million after tax) in the third       quarter of 2005. We have installed the first production module in this       multi-year project and the second and third modules are in the installation       phase. The project is expected to be completed in 2007.
The       aluminum beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other       packaging materials in the beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass       bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while carbonated       soft       drink and beer industry use of PET containers has grown. In Canada, metal       beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the       packaged beverage industry than in the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer       industry.
North       American Metal Food Packaging In       addition to metal beverage containers, Ball produces two-piece and three-piece       steel food containers for packaging vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood,       nutritional products, pet food and other products. These containers are       manufactured in 11plants in the U.S. and Canada and sold primarily to food       processors in North America. In 2005 metal food container sales comprised       14percent of consolidated net sales. Sales volumes of metal food       containers in North America tend to be highest from June through October as       a       result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs. Approximately 32billion       steel food containers were shipped in the U.S. and Canada in 2005, approximately       20percent of which we estimate were shipped by Ball.
Page           2 of           97 In       2005       the company recorded a pretax charge of $4.6million ($3.1million       after tax) related to a reduction in the work force in a metal food container       plant in Ontario, Canada. Also in 2005, the company recorded a pretax charge       of       $6.6million ($4.4million after tax) for the closure of a three-piece       food can manufacturing plant in Quebec, Canada. The Quebec plant was closed       and       ceased operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached       to sell the land and building.
On       March17, 2004, Ball acquired ConAgra Grocery Products Companys (ConAgra)       interest in Ball Western Can Company LLC (Ball Western Can) located in Oakdale,       California, and entered into a multi-year supply contract with ConAgra Foods,       Inc. Prior to the acquisition, Ball Western Can was a 50/50 joint venture       between Ball and ConAgra and was accounted for under the equity method of       accounting. The acquisition of Ball Western Can added approximately one billion       units of annual capacity.
Competitors       in the metal food container product line include two national and a few regional       suppliers and self manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also manufacture       steel food containers. Steel food containers also compete with other packaging       materials in the food industry including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and       the       stand-up pouch. As a result, demand for this product line may be affected during       the next few years and we must increasingly focus on product innovation and       cost       reduction. Service, quality and price are among the key competitive       factors.
North       American Plastic Packaging PET       containers represented 8percent of consolidated net sales in 2005. Demand       for containers made of PET has increased in the beverage and food markets,       with       improved barrier technologies and other advances. This growth in demand should       continue, assuming adequate supplies of resin continue to be available. While       PET beverage containers compete against metal, glass and paper, the historical       increase in the sales of PET containers has come primarily at the expense of       glass containers and through new market introductions. We estimate our 2005       shipments of more than 5billion plastic containers to be approximately       9percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments.
The       company operates five PET facilities in the U.S. Competition in the PET       container industry includes several national and regional suppliers and self       manufacturers. Service, quality and price are important competitive factors.       The       ability to produce customized, differentiated plastic containers is becoming       a       key competitive factor.
Most       of       Balls PET containers are sold under long-term contracts to suppliers of bottled       water and carbonated soft drinks, including bottlers of Pepsi-Cola branded       beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups.       Our       plastic beer containers are being produced for several of our customers and       we       are manufacturing plastic containers for the single serve juice and       winemarkets. Our line of Heat-Tek(TM) PET plastic bottles for hot-filled       beverages, such as sports drinks and juices, includes sizes from 8 ounces to       64       ounces.
International       Packaging The       international packaging segment, which accounted for 24percent of Balls       consolidated net sales in 2005, consists       of 10beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in Europe, as       well as operations in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). Of the       12European plants, four are located in Germany, three in the United       Kingdom, two in France and one each in the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia.       In       total the European plants produced approximately 12billion cans in 2005,       with approximately 50percent of those being produced from steel and       50percent from aluminum. Six of the can plants use aluminum and four use       steel.
Ball       Packaging Europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in       Europe, with an estimated 29percent of European shipments, and produces       two-piece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer, carbonated soft       drinks, mineral water, fruit juices, energy drinks and other       beverages.Ball Packaging Europe is the largest metal beverage container       manufacturer in Germany, France and the Benelux countries and the second largest       metal beverage container manufacturer in the United Kingdom and Poland. Near       the       end of the second quarter of 2005, Ball completed the construction of a new       aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade, Serbia, to serve the       growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern       Europe.
Page           3 of           97 As       in       North America, the metal beverage container continues to compete aggressively       with other packaging materials used by the European beer and carbonated soft       drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer       industry, while the PET container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated       soft drink, juice and mineral water industries.
Due       to       political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning       beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed       in       January 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in       non-refillable containers. During 2003 and 2004, we responded to the resulting       lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our German plants,       implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from       Germany to other countries in the region served by Ball Packaging Europe. We       also closed a plant in the United Kingdom, shut down a production line in       Germany, delayed capital investment projects in France and Poland and converted       one of our steel can production lines in Germany to aluminum in order to       facilitate additional can exports from Germany. In 2004 the German parliament       adopted a new packaging ordinance, imposing a 25 eurocent deposit on all one-way       glass, PET and metal containers for water, beer and carbonated soft drinks.       As       of May 1, 2006, all retailers must redeem all returned one-way containers as       long as they sell such containers. Major retailers in Germany have begun the       process of implementing a returnable system for one-way containers since they,       along with fillers, now appear to accept the deposit as permanent. The       retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee       to       design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have begun to       order reverse vending machines in order to meet the May 1, 2006,       deadline.
The       European beverage can business is capital intensive, requiring significant       investments in machinery and equipment. Profitability is sensitive to selling       prices, foreign exchange rates, transportation costs, production volumes, labor       and the costs and availability of certain raw materials, such as aluminum and       steel. The European aluminum and steel industries are highly consolidated with       three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing 95percent of       European requirements. Material supply contracts are generally for a period       of       one year, although Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer term       agreements. Aluminum is purchased primarily in U.S. dollars while the functional       currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are non-U.S. dollars.       This inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk, which the company       minimizes through the use of derivative contracts. In addition, purchase and       sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing       arrangements.
R&D       efforts in Europe are directed toward the development of new sizes and types       of       metal containers, as well as new uses for the current containers. Other research       and development objectives in this segment include improving manufacturing       efficiencies. The European R&D activities are conducted in a technical       center located in Bonn, Germany.
Through       Ball Asia Pacific Limited, we are one of the largest beverage can manufacturers       in the PRC and believe that our facilities are among the most modern in that       country. Capacity grew rapidly in the PRC in the late 1990s, resulting in a       supply/demand imbalance to which we responded by rationalizing capacity. Demand       growth has resumed in the past few years with projected annual growth expected       to be in the 5 to 10percent range in the near term. Ball is also       undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities in order       to       participate in the projected growth. Our current operations include the       manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants and high-density plastic       containers in two plants. Sales in the PRC represented 3percent of       consolidated net sales. We also participate in three joint ventures that       manufacture aluminum cans and ends in Brazil and in the PRC. In the fourth       quarter of 2004, we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect       of a       receivable of a 35 percent owned joint venture in the PRC. In the first quarter       of 2005, the remaining carrying value of the companys investment in this joint       venture was written off.

Page           4 of           97 Aerospace       and Technologies The       aerospace and technologies segment includes defense operations, civil space       systems and commercial space operations. The defense operations business unit       includes defense systems, systems engineering services, advanced antenna and       video systems and electro-optics and cryogenic systems and components. Sales       in       the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for 12 percent of consolidated       net sales in 2005.
The       majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under       contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor       or subcontractor for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),       the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S. government agencies.       Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented       87 percent of segment sales in 2005. Geopolitical events and executive and       legislative branch priorities have yielded considerable growth opportunities       in       areas matching our core capabilities. However, there is strong competition       for       new business.
Civil       space systems, defense systems and commercial space operations include hardware,       software and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space       science and exploration, environmental and Earth sciences, and defense and       intelligence applications. Major contractual activities frequently involve       the       design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station       control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch       vehicle integration and satellite operations.
Other       hardware activities include: target identification, warning and attitude control       systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and sensor       cooling devices using either closed-cycle mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle       solid and liquid cryogens; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar       attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace and       technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to       government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad       range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence,       training and space systems needs.
Backlog       in the aerospace and technologies segment was $761 million and $694 million       at       December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and consists of the aggregate contract       value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The       2005 backlog includes $458 million expected to be recognized in revenues during       2006, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter.       Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which       are subject to annual funding were $500 million and $393million at       December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Year-to-year comparisons of       backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations.
The       companys aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the U.S.       government or its contractors which have standard termination provisions. The       government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience. However,       if contracts are terminated in this manner, Ball is entitled to reimbursement       for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date       of       termination. U.S. government contracts are also subject to reduction or       modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary       constraints.
Patents In       the       opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the       successful operation of its business as a whole.
Research       and Development Note18,       "Research and Development," in the consolidated financial statements within       Item       8 of this report, contains information on company research and development       activity. Additional information is also included in Item 2, Properties, below.
Page           5 of           97 Environment Aluminum,       steel and PET containers are recyclable, and significant amounts of used       containers are being diverted from the solid waste stream and recycled. Using       the most recent data available, in 2004 approximately 51percent of       aluminum containers, 62percent of steel containers and 22percent of       the PET containers sold in the U.S. were recycled.
Recycling       rates vary throughout Europe, but generally average 60percent for aluminum       and steel containers, which exceeds the European Unions goal of 50percent       recycling for metals. Due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel,       metal packaging recycling rates in Europe compare favorably to those of other       packaging materials.
Compliance       with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment       has       not had a material, adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings       or       competitive position of the company. As more fully described under Item 3,       Legal       Proceedings, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state       environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible       party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous       waste sites. However, the companys information at this time indicates that       these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,       results of operations or financial condition of the company.
Legislation       which would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of       containers, and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging       materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced anywhere       we       operate. While container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions,       similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies       in numerous others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be       made       to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future.       If       such legislation were widely adopted, it potentially could have a material       adverse effect on the business of the company, as well as on the container       manufacturing industry generally, in view of the companys substantial global       sales and investment in metal and PET container manufacturing. However, the       packages we produce are widely used and perform well in U.S. states and Canadian       provinces that have deposit systems.
Employees At       the       end of December 2005 the company employed 13,100people worldwide,       including 9,000employees in the U.S. and 4,100 in other countries. There       are an additional 1,000employees employed in unconsolidated joint ventures       in which Ball participates. Approximately one-third of Ball's North American       packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our European plant employees       are union workers. Collective bargaining agreements with various unions in       the       U.S. have terms of three to five years and those in Europe have terms of one       to       two years. The agreementsexpire at regular intervals and are customarily       renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company       representatives. The company believes that its employee relations are good       and       that its training, education and retention practices assist in enhancing       employee satisfaction levels.

Item       1A. Risk Factors Any       of       the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,       financial condition or results of operations.
The       loss of a key customer could have a significant negative impact on our       sales.
While       we       have diversified our customer base, we do sell a majority of our packaging       products to relatively few major beverage and packaged food companies, some       of       which operate in North America, Europe and Asia.
Although       approximately 70percent of our customer contracts are long-term, these       contracts are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to       meet quality or volume requirements. Because we depend on relatively few major       customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could       be       adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the       purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant       number of these customers' employees or an adverse change in the terms of the       supply agreements with these customers.
The       primary customers for our aerospace work are U.S. government agencies or their       prime contractors. These sales represented approximately 11percent of       Ball's consolidated 2005 net sales. Our contracts with these customers are       subject to, among other things, the following risks:  unilateral                 termination for convenience by the                 customers;  reduction                 or modification in the scope of the contracts due to changes in the                 customer's requirements or budgetary                 constraints;  under                 fixed-price contracts, increased or unexpected costs causing losses                 or                 reduced profits; and  under                 cost reimbursement contracts, unallowable costs causing losses or                 reduced                 profits.
Page           7 of           97 We       face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our       profitability.
Competition       within the packaging industry is intense. Increases in productivity, combined       with surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing       pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging       industry are price, service and quality. Some of our competitors may have       greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Our current or potential       competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed       superior to ours.
We       are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in       lower       profits and reduced cash flows.
The       metal       beverage can is subject to significant competition from substitute products,       particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET, single serve       beer bottles, and containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials.       Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense       in the United States and the United Kingdom. There can be no assurance that       we       will successfully compete against alternative beverage containers which could       result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow.
We       have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our       products decreased.
For       the       12months ended December 31, 2005, 42percent of our consolidated net       sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans, and we expect to derive a       significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage       cans.       We sell no PET bottles in Europe. Our business would suffer if the use of metal       beverage cans decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum       and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future       success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to cans, or       the       demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected, our business,       financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely       affected.
Our       business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks       resulting from increased international operations.
We       derived 24percent of our total net sales from outside of North America in       the year ended December31, 2005. The increased scope of international       operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more       difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are       not       limited to, the following:  political                 and economic instability in foreign                 markets;  foreign                 governments' restrictive trade                 policies;  the                 imposition of duties, taxes or government                 royalties;  foreign                 exchange rate risks;  difficulties                 in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property                 rights; and  the                 geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences between                 personnel                 in different areas of the world.
Any       of       these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial       condition or results of operations.
We       are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
For       the       12months ended December 31, 2005, 72percent of our net sales were       attributable to operations with U.S. dollars as their functional currency,       and       28percent of our net sales were attributable to operations having other       functional currencies, with12 percent of net       sales attributable to the euro.
Our         reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Historically, Ball's foreign operations,         including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been         denominated in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect         that         our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated. As a result, the         U.S.         dollar value of Ball's foreign operations have varied, and will continue         to         vary, with exchange rate fluctuations. In this respect, historically Ball         has         been primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro,         British         pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and         Serbian dinar.
Page             8 of             97 A       decrease in the value of any of these currencies, especially the euro, relative       to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the       value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in U.S. dollars       in our financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our       business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S.       dollars.
In       addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the       earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period       comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting,       the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the local currency       is the functional currency, are translated using period-end exchange rates,       and       the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average       exchange rates during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported       in       accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders'       equity.
We       actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in order to       mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and reduce earnings volatility       associated with foreign exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward       contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and, as a result,       we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part,       by       the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities.
Our       business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular       risks in certain regions of the world.
We       may       experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or       more       periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating       results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to       lower prices, exists in a number of regions, including Asia and Latin America,       and may persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage such operational       fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such       developments will be critical to our continued growth and       profitability.
If       we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement       our       key objectives.
We       believe that our future success depends, in large part, on our experienced       management team. Losing the services of key members of our management team       could       make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our       objectives.
Decreases       in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our       competitiveness.
Our       success depends in part on our ability to improve production processes and       services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing       customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or       to       develop new products, we may not be able to remain competitive with other       manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of       operations could be adversely affected.
Bad       weather and climate changes may result in lower       sales.
We       manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. Unseasonably       cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers.       In addition, poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop       yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food       containers, creating potentially adverse effects on our       business.
Page           9 of           97 We       are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw       materials.
We       purchase aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging       supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from       numerous independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in       price attributable to a number of factors, including general economic       conditions, the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the       availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into       commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments       to hedge our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials       will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices.       Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our       business, financial condition or results of operations. Because our North       American contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer,       increasing raw materials costs may not impact our near-term profitability but       could decrease our sales volume over time. In Europe, our contracts do not       typically allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly       use       derivative agreements to manage this risk; however, our hedging procedures       may       be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if materials costs       increase suddenly in Europe.
Prolonged       work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial       position.
As       of       December 31, 2005, approximately one-third of our employees in North America       and       most of our employees in Europe were covered by one or more collective       bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered       expirations over the next three years. Although we consider our employee       relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any       facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our       business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot       assure you that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements       new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new       agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us.
Our       business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance       costs.
Our       operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating       to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the       handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous       substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated us, along       with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the       cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we       do       not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have       a       material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,       capital expenditures or competitive position.
If       we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill, our net earnings       and       net worth could be materially adversely affected.
We       have       $1,258.6million of net goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet       as of December 31, 2005. We are required to periodically determine if our       goodwill has become impaired, in which case we would write down the impaired       portion of our goodwill. If we were required to write down all or part of our       goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely       affected.
If       the investments in Ball's pension plans do not perform as expected, we may       have       to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be       available to cover operating expenses.
Ball       maintains noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering substantially       all of its U.S. employees, which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions.       The plans' assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income       securities. If the investments in the plan do not perform at expected levels,       then we will have to contribute additional funds to ensure that the program       will       be able to pay out benefits as scheduled. Such an increase in funding could       result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings and the       recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders'       equity. We recorded an increase in our minimum pension liability in the fourth       quarter of 2005 largely as a reduction in the assumed discount rate. This       increase in pension liability was reflected as an increase in other liabilities       and a corresponding decrease in stockholders' equity.
Page           10 of           97 Our       significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us       from       fulfilling our obligations under the notes.
We       have a       significant amount of debt. On December 31, 2005, we had total debt of       $1,589.7million. Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date       was 3.4 times (see Exhibit12 attached to this Annual Report). Our high       level of debt could have important consequences, including the       following:  use                 of a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest                 on our                 notes, the new credit facilities and our other debt, which will reduce                 the                 availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital                 expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business                 activities;  increase                 our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry                 conditions;  limit                 our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business                 and the industry in which we                 operate;  restrict                 us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business                 opportunities;  place                 us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that                 have                 less debt;  limit                 our ability to make capital expenditures in order to maintain our                 manufacturing plants in good working order and repair;                 and  limit,                 along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt,                 among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose                 of                 assets or pay cash dividends.
In       addition, a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates.       If       market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt       service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we       sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements       may       not offer complete protection from this risk.
We       will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt. Our ability       to       generate cash depends on many factors beyond our       control.
Our       ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, including the notes,       and       to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts,       will       depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general       economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors       that       may be beyond our control.
Based       on       our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations,       available cash and available borrowings under our new credit facilities, will       be       adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the next several years barring       any unforeseen circumstances which are beyond our control.
We       cannot       assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from       operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our new       credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay       our       debt, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need       to       refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before       maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our       debt, including our new credit facilities and our senior notes, on commercially       reasonable terms or at all.

Properties The       companys properties described below are well maintained, are considered       adequate and are being utilized for their intended purposes.
Balls       corporate headquarters and the Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. offices       are located in Broomfield, Colorado. The Colorado-based operations of the       aerospace and technologies business occupy a variety of company-owned and leased       facilities in Broomfield, Boulder and Westminster, which together aggregate       1.4millionsquare feet of office, laboratory, research and       development, engineering and test and manufacturing space. During 2005 the       company commenced construction on additional facilities adjacent to existing       facilities in Boulder and Westminster. Other aerospace and technologies       operations carry on business in company-owned and leased facilities in Georgia,       New Mexico, Ohio, Virginia, Washington and Australia.
The       offices of the companys North American packaging operations are in Westminster,       Colorado, and the offices for the European packaging operations are in Ratingen,       Germany. Also located in Westminster is the Ball Technology and Innovation       Center, which serves as a research and development facility for the North       American metal packaging and plastic container operations. The European       Technical Centre, which serves as a research and development facility for the       European beverage can manufacturing operations, is located in Bonn,       Germany.
Information       regarding the approximate size of the manufacturing locations for significant       packaging operations, which are owned or leased by the company, is set forth       below. Facilities in the process of being shut down have been excluded from       the       list.

Item       3.
Legal       Proceedings North       America As       previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers       the company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry       Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On June12, 1992, the       company was served with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver       (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contributions from       the       company and approximately 38other companies. The company filed its answer       denying the allegations of the complaint. On July8, 1992, the company was       served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company,       Inc., seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs       associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the       allegations of the complaints.
In       July       1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with       Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc.       (collectively Waste Management) and Denver pursuant to which Waste Management       and Denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company and Waste Management       agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and       lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions       seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of       the       site. Several other companies, which are defendants in the above-referenced       lawsuits, had already entered into the settlement and indemnification agreement       with Waste Management and Denver. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to       guarantee the obligations for Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste       Management of Colorado, Inc. Waste Management and Denver may seek additional       payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed       $319million. In 2003 Waste Management, Inc., indicated that the cost of       the site might exceed $319million in 2030, approximately three years       before the projected completion of the project. The company might also be       responsible for payments (based on 1992 dollars) for any additional wastes       which       may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified       after the execution of the settlement agreement. While remediating the site,       contaminants were encountered which could add an additional cleanup cost of       approximately $10million. This additional cleanup cost could, in turn, add       approximately $1million to total site costs for the PRP       group.
At       this       time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively       involved. Based on the information available to the company at this time, the       company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect       upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the       company.
The       company previously reported that, on August1, 1997, the USEPA sent notice       of potential liability to 19PRPs concerning past activities at one or more       of the four Rocky Flats parcels (including land owned by Precision Chemicals       now       owned by Great Western Inorganics) at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site       (RFIP) located in Jefferson County, Colorado. The RFIP site also includes the       American Ecological Recycling and Research Page           14 of           97 Company(AERRCO)       site and a site owned by Thoro Products Company. Based upon sampling at the       site       in 1996, the USEPA determined that additional site work would be required to       determine the extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site.       In       1996 the USEPA requested that the PRPs perform certain site work. On       December19, 1997, the USEPA issued an Administrative Order on Consent       (AOC) to conduct engineering estimates and cost analyses. The company has funded       approximately $70,000toward these costs. The PRPs have negotiated an       agreement and the company contributed $5,000as an initial group       contribution. The company has agreed to pay 12percent of the costs of       cleanup at the AERRCO site and a percentage of the cleanup costs on the Thoro       site. On January8, 2003, and October9, 2003, the company made       additional payments of $97,200 each (total $194,400) toward the cost of cleanup.       The company paid $35,355in 2004 toward the cleanup. The air sparge and       soil vapor extraction system was installed at a total cost of $1.1million       and was placed in operation in May 2005. Based on the information, or lack       thereof, available to the company at the present time, the company does not       believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,       results of operations or financial condition of the company.
As       previously reported, in October 2001 representatives of Vauxmont Intermountain       Communities (Vauxmont) notified six of the PRPs at the AERRCO site, including       the company (AERRCO PRPs), that hazardous materials might have contaminated       property owned by Vauxmont. The AERRCO site is contained within the RFIP site.       Vauxmont also alleges that it lost $7million on a contract with a home       developer for the purchase of a portion of the land. Vauxmont representatives       requested that the AERRCO PRPs study any contamination to the Vauxmont real       estate. The AERRCO PRPs agreed to undertake such a study and sought the USEPAs       final approval. The sampling results were made available to all parties. No       further claims have been made against the company by Vauxmont to date. Based       on       the information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time,       the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse       effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of       the       company.
As       previously reported, during July 1992, the company received information that       it       had been named a PRP with respect to the Solvents Recovery of New England Site       (SRSNE) located in Southington, Connecticut. According to the information       received, it is alleged that the company contributed approximately       0.08816percent of the waste contributed to the site on a volumetric basis.       The PRP group has been involved in negotiations with the USEPA regarding the       remediation of the site. The company has paid approximately $17,500toward       site investigation and remediation efforts. The PRP group spent $15million       through the end of 2001. Approximately $1.5million more was spent to       complete a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Studyand pay for       remediation work through 2003. As of December 2001, projected remediation cost       estimates for a bioremediation and enhanced oxidation system ranged from       $20million to $30million. The PRP group offered a $5.5million       settlement to resolve the USEPA claim of $16million for past costs at the       SRSNE site. PRP/USEPA negotiations to resolve the past cost claims from the       USEPA have not been resolved and are not being actively pursued by the PRP       group. A natural resources damage claim of approximately $3million is       anticipated. USEPA gave final approval for a $29 million remediation plan for       the site on October11, 2005. The company will be responsible for       approximately 0.00109percent of the future site costs. Based on the       information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time,       the       company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect       upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the       company.
On       December30, 2002, the company received a 104(e) letter from the USEPA       pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability       Act (CERCLA) requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste       disposal practices of Heekin Can Company and the relationship between the       company and Heekin Can Company. Region 5 of the USEPA is involved in the cleanup       of the Jackson Brothers Paint Company site, which consists of four, and possibly       five, sites in and around Laurel, Indiana. The Jackson Brothers Paint Company       apparently disposed of drums of waste in those sites during the 1960s and 1970s.       The USEPA has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was sent       to       the sites from the Cincinnati plant operated by Heekin Can Company. The Indiana       Department of Environmental Management referred this matter to the USEPA for       removal of the drums and cleanup. At the present time there are an undetermined       number of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified       by the USEPA as originating from Heekin Can Company. The USEPA has sent 104(e)       letters to seven PRPs including Heekin Can Company. On January30, 2003,       the company responded to the request for information pursuant to       Section104(e) of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs       to be between $4million and $5million. Based on the information, or       lack thereof, available to the company at the present time, the company does       not       believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,       results of operations or financial condition of the company.
Page           15 of           97 As       previously reported, on October6, 2005, Ball Metal Beverage Container       Corp. (BMBCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was served with an       amended complaint filed by Crown Packaging Technology, Inc. et.al.       (Crown), in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western       Division at Dayton, Ohio. The complaint alleges that the manufacture, sale       and       use of certain ends by BMBCC and its customers infringes certain claims of       Crowns U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees,       and declaratory and injunctive relief. BMBCC has formally denied the allegations       of the complaint. Based on the information available to the company at the       present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material       adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition       of the company.
On       November21, 2005, Ball Plastic Container Corp. (BPCC), a wholly owned       subsidiary of the company, was served with a complaint filed by Constar       International Inc. (Constar) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District       of Wisconsin. The complaint alleges that the manufacture and sale of plastic       bottles having oxygen barrier properties infringes certain claims of a Constar       U.S. patent. Constar also sued Honeywell International Inc., the supplier of       the       oxygen barrier material to BPCC. The complaint seeks monetary damages, fees       and       declaratory and injunctive relief. BPCC has formally denied the allegations       of       the complaint. Based on the information available to the company at the present       time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse       effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or the financial condition       of       the company.
Europe Ball       Packaging Europe (BPE), together with other plaintiffs, is contesting in federal       and state administrative courts the enactment of a mandatory deposit for       non-refillable containers based on the German Packaging Regulation       (Verpackungsverordnung). The proceedings in the State Administrative Court       are       still active in two states (Bavaria and Hamburg), and the proceedings in the       other states have been declared inactive or have been retracted. The Federal       Constitutional Court in Karsruhe (Bundesverfassungsgericht) has denied the       motions of the plaintiffs for judgment. At the federal level, a proceeding       with       the Administrative Court in Berlin (Verwaltungsgericht Berlin) is still pending.       BPE filed a motion for an expedited procedure with the objective of reinstating       the suspensive effect of the procedure. The Administrative Court has denied       the       motion. BPE has filed an appeal against this decision with the Higher       Administrative Court in Berlin (Oberverwaltungsgericht Berlin), which also       denied the motion. The potential financial risk of legal fees, which BPE may       incur in connection with the procedures set out above, amounts to approximately       280,000 and has been accrued by BPE. The European Court of Justice has issued       a       judgment that confirmed that the German deposit legislation violated, among       other European Union (EU) regulations, the principle of free trade of goods       within the EU and disadvantaged the importers of beverages versus German       beverage producers. Following this judgment, two German law firms have suggested       that importers of beverages and possibly even local beverage producers may       be       able to market beverages in Germany without mandatory deposit until a       Germany-wide functioning return system is implemented. The German government       does not share this point of view and has indicated that it will continue to       apply the mandatory deposit regulations.
In       December 2004 the German government passed new legislation that imposes a       mandatory deposit of 25eurocents on nonrefillable containers in respect of       all beverages except milk, wine, fruit juices and certain alcoholic beverages.       Beverages in beverage carton packaging are also excluded from the deposit.       The       legislation required that the so-called island solutions are to be terminated       after an interim period of 12months after the legislation takes effect.       The new legislation came into force in May 2005. Island solutions therefore       will       no longer be permissible as of May1, 2006. The relevant industries,       including BPE and its competitors, are currently setting up a Germany-wide       return system planned to be operational in or about May 2006. Based upon the       information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time,       the       company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect       upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the       company.

Managements       Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of       Operations Managements       discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated       financial statements and accompanying notes. Ball Corporation and its       subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball or the company or we and our in the following discussion and analysis.
BUSINESS       OVERVIEW Ball       Corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal and plastic       packaging to the beverage and food industries. Our packaging products are       produced for a variety of end uses and are currently manufactured in       49plants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies       and services to governmental and commercial customers.
We       sell       our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food producers with       which       we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our       high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts.       While we have diversified our customer base, we do sell a majority of our       packaging products to relatively few major beverage and food companies in North       America, Europe and the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), as do our equity joint       ventures in Brazil, the U.S. and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from       relatively few suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration,       our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely       affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a material change in       a       supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our long-term       relationships and contracts mitigate these risks.
In       the       rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs,       developing new products, expanding volume and increasing pricing where possible.       We are in the early stages of a project to upgrade and streamline our North       American beverage can end manufacturing capabilities, a project that will result       in productivity gains and cost reductions. While the U.S. and Canadian beverage       container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the European, PRC and       Brazilian beverage can markets are growing (excluding the effects of the German       mandatory deposit discussed in Note21 to the consolidated financial       statements) and are expected to continue to grow. We are capitalizing on the       European growth by continuing to reconfigure some of our European can       manufacturing lines and by opening in 2005 a new beverage can manufacturing       plant in Belgrade, Serbia.
Balls       consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We       attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial       instruments, as discussed in the Financial Instruments and Risk Management sections (within Item 7A and Item8, Note 16, of this report).
As       part       of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and       existing products that meet the ever-expanding needs of our beverage and food       customers. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and       other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging. This packaging       development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with       major beverage and food customers.
The       primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and       technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors.       It       is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency       budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or prolong contract       performance.
We       recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies       segment using the cost-to-cost, percentage of completion method of accounting.       Our present contract mix consists of approximately two-thirds cost-plus       contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon profit component,       and approximately one-thirdfixed price contracts. We include time and       material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically       provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. Throughout       the       period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary,       revise our estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress       toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding       and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment       include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.
Page           19 of           97 Management       uses various measures to evaluate company performance. The primary financial       measures we use are earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before       interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), diluted earnings per       share, economic value added (operating earnings after tax, as defined by the       company, less a capital charge based on invested capital times our cost of       capital), operating cash flow and free cash flow (generally defined by the       company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures).       These       financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability       between periods. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include       production spoilage rates, quality control measures, safety statistics and       production and shipment volumes. Additional measures used to evaluate       performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue       realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog       (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).
We       recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is critically       important to the success of Ball and, because of this, we strive to pay       employees competitively and encourage their prudent ownership of the companys       common stock. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of       compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value added       operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk.       Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee       contributions with Ball common stock, many employees, regardless of       organizational level, have opportunities to participate as Ball       shareholders.
CONSOLIDATED       SALES AND EARNINGS The       company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized       alonga combination ofproduct lines and geographic areas- North       American metal beverage packaging, North American metal food packaging, North       American plastic packaging, international packaging and aerospace and       technologies. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.       We       also have investments in companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are       accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and accordingly, their       results are not included in segment sales or earnings.
North       American Metal Beverage Packaging The       North       American metal beverage packaging segment consists of operations located in       the       U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, which manufacture metal container products used       primarily in beverage packing. This segment accounted for 42percent of       consolidated net sales in 2005 (43percent in 2004). Sales were slightly       higher in 2005 than in 2004 as lower 2005 sales volumes were offset by higher       aluminum prices passed through to our customers. Metal beverage container       volumes in 2005 were 2.5percent below the previous years levels as a       result of poor weather in the first quarter, temporary volume reductions and       general softness in the beer and carbonated soft drink markets. Net changes       in       contracted volumes are expected to result in the restoration of the reduced       2005volumes during 2006 and beyond. Sales were 3percent higher in       2004 than in 2003. Contributing to the increase were the pass through of       aluminum price increases and higher volumes in our specialty can products,       partially offset by declines in standard 12-ounce can volumes. Sales in 2004       improved over 2003 due to the $28million acquisition in March2003 of       Metal Packaging International, Inc., a small producer of metal beverage can       ends. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our shipments       of       metal beverage containers were approximately 31percent of total U.S. and       Canadian shipments in 2005.
We       continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business, which       includes cans of different shapes, diameters and fill volumes, and cans with       added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions. The       conversion of a manufacturing line in our Golden, Colorado, plant from 12-ounce       to 24-ounce cans was completed in the second quarter of 2005. We also announced       plans to convert a line in our Monticello, Indiana, plant from 12-ounce can       manufacturing to a line capable of producing beverage cans in sizes up to       16ounces. This conversion was substantially completed in       January2006.
Earnings       in the segment were $229.8million in 2005 compared to $279.1million       in 2004 and $250.8million in 2003. The third quarter of 2005 included a       pretax charge of $19.3million ($11.7million after tax) related to a       project to significantly upgrade and streamline our North American beverage       can       end manufacturing capabilities. The charge included the write off of obsolete       equipment spare parts and tooling, as well as employee termination costs. Over       time, this capital project is expected to result in productivity improvements       and reduced manufacturing costs.
Page           20 of           97 We       have       installed the first production module in this multi-year project and the second       and third modules are in the installation phase. The project is expected to       be       completed in 2007.
Also       contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 were higher freight costs from       fuel surcharges, higher other direct material and utility costs and a       $9million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under       the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method of accounting. Energy, freight and other       direct material costs were $32million higher in 2005 than in 2004,       partially offset by efficiency gains, cost controls and lower selling, general       and administrative costs in 2005. While pricing pressures continue on our raw       materials, other direct materials, and freight and utility costs, we continue       to       work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes, as well as       preserve our margins.
The       improvement in segment earnings in 2004 versus 2003 was the result of higher       sales and production volumes, improved product mix and cost reduction programs.       Partially offsetting these 2004 earnings improvements was an increase in cost       of       sales due to rising raw material costs under the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method       of accounting. In the fourth quarter of 2003, a gain of $1.6 million was       recorded in connection with the sale of a metal beverage container facility       that       was shut down in December 2001.
North       American Metal Food Packaging The       North       American metal food packaging segment consists of operations located in the       U.S.       and Canada, which manufacture metal container products used primarily in food       packaging. Segment sales in 2005 comprised 14percent of consolidated net       sales (14percent in 2004) and were 6percent higher than 2004 sales.       Sales in 2005 reflected higher prices from the pass through of higher raw       material costs. Sales volumes were flat compared to 2004 levels including,       in       the first quarter of 2005, the inclusion of a full quarters results from our       Oakdale, California, facility which was acquired in March2004 (discussed       below). Sales were higher in 2004 than in 2003 due primarily to the acquisition       of the Oakdale, California, facility, higher selling prices as a result of       the       pass through of raw material costs and some pre-buying by customers in the       fourth quarter of 2004 ahead of expected 2005 steel price increases. During       2004       and 2005, we were able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases       and surcharges levied by steel producers. We estimate our 2005 shipments of       6.7billion cans to be approximately 20percent of total U.S. and       Canadian metal food container shipments, based on publicly available trade       information.
On       March       17, 2004, we acquired ConAgra Grocery Products Companys (ConAgra) interest in       Ball Western Can Company LLC (Ball Western Can) for $30million. Ball       Western Can, located in Oakdale, California, was established in 2000 as a 50/50       joint venture between Ball and ConAgra and, prior to the acquisition, was       accounted for by Ball using the equity method of accounting. Ball and ConAgras       parent company, ConAgra Foods Inc., signed a long-term agreement under which       Ball provides metal food containers to ConAgra food packing locations in       California. The acquisition of Ball Western Can added approximately one billion       units of annual capacity.
Segment       earnings were $11.6million in 2005 compared to $44.3million in 2004       and $19.8million in 2003. The fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax       charge of $4.6million ($3.1million after tax) for pension, severance       and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in our       Burlington, Ontario, plant. The second quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge       of $8.8million ($5.9million after tax) for the closure of a       three-piece food can manufacturing plant in Quebec. This action was taken to       better match capacity to demand. The Quebec plant was closed and ceased       operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached to       sell the land and building, which resulted in the second quarter charge being       offset by a $2.2million gain ($1.5million after tax) in the fourth       quarter to adjust the Quebec plant to net realizable value.
Also       contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 were higher freight costs from       fuel surcharges, higher other direct material and utility costs and an       $8.5million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs       under the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method of accounting. Energy, freight and       other direct material costs were $16million higher in 2005 than in 2004,       partially offset by efficiency gains, cost controls and lower selling, general       and administrative costs in 2005. While pricing pressures continue on all of       our       raw materials, other direct materials, and freight and utility costs, we       continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes,       as       well as preserve our margins.
Page             21 of             97 The       improvement in earnings in 2004 versus 2003 was the result of strong fourth       quarter 2004 food can sales, higher production volumes, improved product mix       and       cost reduction programs. In addition, 2003 earnings were negatively impacted       by       $11million of start-up costs associated with a new two-piece food can       manufacturing line in Milwaukee. Partially offsetting these 2004 earnings       improvements was an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs       under the LIFO (last-in-first-out) method of accounting. In the first quarter       of       2003, a net charge of $1.4million was booked to record the costs of       closing a metal food container plant offset by a gain from the sale of a       previously closed plant.
North       American Plastic Packaging The       North       American plastic packaging segment consists of operations located in the U.S.       which manufacture polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic container products       used mainly in beverage packaging. Segment sales in 2005 comprised       8percent of consolidated sales (7percent in 2004) and increased       22percent compared to 2004. The sales increase was related to the pass       through to our customers of higher resin prices, as well as 7.5percent       higher sales volumes in 2005 compared to 2004, related to higher demand for       barrier and heat-set containers that provide longer shelf-life for products,       combined with strong demand for plastic water bottles. Sales in 2004 were       7percent higher than in 2003, primarily as a result of several new preform       sales contracts secured during 2004 and the pass through of raw material price       increases. Carbonated soft drink and water sales volumes in 2004 were lower       than       expected primarily due to reduced demand on the East Coast, resulting from       competitive pressures, and a delay in the commencement of a new customer supply       opportunity on the West Coast. Although only a small percentage of our total       volume, juice, sports drinks and beer container sales increased in 2005 and       are       expected to grow considerably in the future as more focus is given to these       specialty markets and the development of our Heat-Tek(TM) business. We estimate       our 2005 shipments of more than 5billion bottles to be approximately       9percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments.
Segment       earnings were $17.4million in 2005 compared to $11.6million in 2004       and $12.3million in 2003. The improvement in earnings in 2005 was the       result of higher sales and production volumes and growth in specialty products.       Partially offsetting these improvements in 2005 were higher utility costs.       Segment earnings in 2004 and 2003 included $2million and       $2.7million, respectively, of costs associated with the relocation of the       plastics offices and research and development facility from Atlanta, Georgia,       to       Colorado. Earnings in 2004 were also negatively impacted by continued pricing       pressures on commodity plastic containers for carbonated soft drink customers.       Segment earnings in 2004 also included a gain of $0.7 million as costs related       to the shut down and relocation of the Atlanta plastics offices were less than       expected.
International       Packaging International       packaging includes the production and sale of metal beverage container products       manufactured and sold in Europe and Asia as well as plastic containers       manufactured and sold in Asia. This segment accounted for 24percent of       consolidated net sales in 2005 (23percent in 2004).
Ball       Packaging Europe, which represents an estimated 29percent of the total       European metal beverage container manufacturing capacity, has manufacturing       plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Poland       and Serbia. European sales were 7percenthigher in 2005 than in 2004       primarily as a result of an 8.5percent increase in sales volumes. The       continued weak demand in Germany, as a result of the mandatory deposit       legislation previously reported on, is being offset by stronger demand elsewhere       in Europe, including southern and eastern Europe. Sales in 2005 were adversely       affected by unseasonably cool, wet weather in parts of Europe. European sales       were 10percent higher in 2004 than in 2003 as a result of a stronger euro,       higher selling prices and successful export programs from the German plants       to       other European countries.
In       response to increased demand for custom cans in Europe, a steel can       manufacturing line in the Netherlands was converted to aluminum custom cans       during the first quarter of 2005. The construction of a new beverage can plant       in Belgrade, Serbia, was completed near the end of the second quarter of 2005       to       serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern Europe.       The       plant became fully operational during the third quarter of 2005. The Serbian       plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can       end       manufacturing module for future growth. In the first quarter of 2004, a steel       can manufacturing line in Germany was converted to the production of aluminum       cans and, in the first quarter of 2003, one German can manufacturing line was       idled.
Page           22 of           97 Sales       in       the PRC in 2005 increased 21percent over 2004 levels, which were       18percent higher than in 2003. The increases were largely the result of       higher volumes. The overall beverage can market in the PRC was also strong       throughout 2005 with expectations of continued growth into 2006. We expect       demand for aluminum beverage cans to grow in the coming years, as both       multinational and Chinese beverage fillers expand their markets.
International       packaging segment earnings of $181.8million in 2005 decreased       8percent compared to 2004 earnings of $198million. The fourth       quarter of 2005 included a $9.3million gain primarily resulting from the       final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidated China operations       for amounts less than originally estimated. First quarter 2005 segment earnings       included a $3.4million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying       value of an equity investment in the PRC. Earnings in 2004 included income       of       $13.7million related to the realization of proceeds on assets in the PRC       being in excess of amounts previously estimated, and costs of liquidation being       less than anticipated in a business consolidation charge taken in 2001.
Higher       material, energy and transportation costs, as well as second and third quarter       start up costs related to a line conversion in the Netherlands and the new       Serbia plant had a negative effect on 2005 segment earnings. Partially       offsetting these higher costs were lower selling, general and administrative       costs. Earnings improved in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a stronger euro and       higher profit margins in both Europe and the PRC due in large part to       operational cost reduction programs. Segment earnings in 2004 were also improved       over 2003 by the nonrecurrence of purchase accounting adjustments which       increased Ball Packaging Europes cost of sales in 2003. The stronger euro       improved our net earnings per diluted share by $0.08 in 2004 compared to       2003.
During       the fourth quarter of 2004, Sanshui Jianlibao FTB Packaging Limited (Sanshui       JFP), a 35 percent owned PRC joint venture, experienced a greater than customary       seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties. After discussions       with representatives of the local Chinese government, which had temporarily       taken control of our joint venture partners business, we recorded an allowance       for doubtful accounts in respect of Sanshui JFPs receivable from the joint       venture partner. Our share of the bad debt provision amounted to       $15.2million and is included in the 2004 consolidated statement of       earnings as equity in results of affiliates. Information learned late in the       first quarter of 2005 led the company to record expense of $3.4million to       write off the remaining carrying value of this investment.
In       June2001 we announced a plan to exit the general line metal can business       in the PRC and reduce our PRC beverage can manufacturing capacity by closing       two       plants. A $237.7million pretax charge ($185million after tax and       minority interest impact) was recorded in connection with this reorganization.       We recorded earnings of $9.3million during 2005, $13.7million in       2004 and $3.3million in 2003 as restructuring activities were completed,       resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated,       as       well as costs incurred being less than estimated, including settlement of tax       matters. All costs and transactions related to the PRC restructuring have been       concluded.
Aerospace       and Technologies Aerospace       and technologies segment sales represented 12percent of 2005 consolidated       net sales (12percent in 2004) and were 6percent higher than in 2004.       Sales in 2004 were 22percent higher than in 2003. The progressively higher       sales resulted from a combination of newly awarded contracts and additions       to       previously awarded contracts. The aerospace and technologies business won a       number of large, strategic contracts and delivered a great deal of sophisticated       space and defense instrumentation throughout the three-year period. Earnings       of       $54.7million in 2005 were 12percent higher compared to 2004 despite       an expense of $3.8million in the first quarter of 2005 for the write down       to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company. This       investment was sold in October2005 for approximately its carrying value.       The improvement in earnings was primarily the result of higher sales and       improved program performance. Net earnings decreased in 2004 by 2percent       compared to 2003 largely due to increased pension costs and higher costs       incurred on certain cost-plus contracts without corresponding additional fees       as       these contracts reached completion. In addition, 2003 margins included       $8million due to successfully achieving milestones in two key       programs.
Page           23 of           97 On       July4, 2005, the Deep Impact spacecraft accomplished its goal of       collecting data from comet Tempel1, 83million miles from Earth,       using an impactor spacecraft to strike the comet and recording the results       of       the impact with a flyby spacecraft. The Deep Impact mission has provided       groundbreaking scientific information regarding the origins of the solar system.       Some of the segments other high-profile contracts include: WorldView, an       advanced commercial remote sensing satellite; the James Webb Space Telescope,       a       successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Space-Based Space Surveillance       System, which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital       debris; NPOESS, the next-generation satellite weather monitoring system; and       a       number of antennas for the Joint Strike Fighter.
Sales       to       the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as       a       subcontractor, represented 87percent of segment sales in 2005,       82percent in 2004 and 96percent of segment sales in 2003.
The       percentage representing U.S. government sales has decreased compared to 2003       due       to growing revenues related to the WorldView contract.
Contracted       backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December31, 2005 and       2004, was $761million and $694million, respectively. Year-to-year       comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future       operations.
For       additional information regarding the companys segments, see the summary of       business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial       statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business       consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management, actuaries       and other independent parties and were developed from information available       at       the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will       be       reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings       and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details       about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided       in       Note4 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within       Item8 of this report.
Selling       and Administrative Expenses Selling       and administrative expenses were $231.6million, $267.9million and       $234.2million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Expenses in 2005 were       lower in all areas of the company due largely to lower employee compensation       and       benefit costs, including the companys deposit share program and       economic-value-added based incentive compensation plans. In addition, foreign       currency hedging gains were higher in 2005 than in 2004. These lower costs       were       partially offset by higher pension costs, higher accounts receivable       securitization fees and the write down of the PRC and aerospace equity       investments in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in 2004 compared to       2003       was due to higher costs related to the companys deposit share program, higher       pension and incentive costs, costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance       in       2004, higher research and development costs, the effects of foreign exchange       rates and growth in our aerospace and technologies segment. In 2005 we reduced       our U.S. pension plan discount rate from 6.25percent to 6percent,       resulting in $5.4million higher U.S. pension expense for the year compared       to 2004, most of which was included in cost of sales. In 2004 we also reduced       our U.S. pension plan discount rate from 6.75percent to 6.25percent,       resulting in $8.3million higher U.S. pension expense for the year compared       to 2003.
For       the       U.S. pension plans, we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption       at 8.5percent for 2006 while further reducing the discount rate assumption       to 5.75percent. Based on these assumptions, U.S. pension expense for 2006       is anticipated to increase $10.5million compared to 2005, most of which       will be included in cost of sales. Pension expense in Europe and Canada combined       is expected to be slightly lower than the 2005 expense. A reduction of the       plan       asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in       additional expense of approximately $1.9million while a quarter of a       percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately       $3.8million of additional expense. Additional information regarding the       companys pension plans is provided in Note13 accompanying the       consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report.
On       October26, 2005, Balls board of directors approved the accelerated       vesting of the out-of-the-money, unvested nonqualified stock options granted       in       April2005. The acceleration affects approximately 665,000options       granted to approximately 290employees at an exercise price of $39.74. The       accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options will allow the company to       eliminate approximately $5million of pretax expense (approximately       $3million after tax) over the next four years.
Page           24 of           97 Interest       and Taxes Consolidated       interest expense was $116.4million in 2005, including debt refinancing       costs of $19.3million; $103.7million in 2004 and $141.1million       in 2003, including debt refinancing costs of $15.2million. The       progressively lower expense was due to lower average borrowings and higher       capitalized interest. The debt refinancing costs in 2005 of $19.3million       were costs associated with the refinancing of the companys senior credit       facilities and the redemption in the last half of 2005 of the companys       7.75%senior notes, which were due in August 2006. The debt refinancing       costs in 2003 of $15.2million were associated with the early redemption of       the companys 8.25% senior subordinated notes in August 2003.
Balls       consolidated effective income tax rate for 2005 was 28.7percent compared       to 32percent in 2004and 31.3percent in 2003. The decrease in       the effective tax rate is primarily due to the net tax benefit recorded on       the       repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004       (Jobs Act), the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the       marginal tax rate, increased research and development tax credits and the       manufacturing deduction effective in 2005 under the Jobs Act. (Further details       of the amounts repatriated under the Jobs Act are available in Note12       accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this       report.) These benefits were somewhat offset by the fact that no tax benefit       was       provided in respect of the equity investment write downs in the first quarter       of       2005. The $3.8million write down of the aerospace investment is not tax       deductible while the realization of tax deductibility of the $3.4million       PRC write down, which will be a capital loss, is not reasonably assured as       the       company does not have, nor does it anticipate, any capital gains to offset       the       capital losses.
Balls       consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 was 32percent compared to       31.3percent in 2003. The overall 2004 effective rate was slightly higher,       primarily due to higher North American earnings than in 2003, but continues       to       reflect a low consolidated European income tax rate due to lower profits in       Germany, reflecting the impact of the refundable mandatory deposit on       non-refillable containers imposed on January1, 2003, and a tax holiday in       Poland. Germany has the highest tax rate of the European countries in which       Ball       has operations.
In       connection with the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) examination of Balls       consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2003, the IRS       has       proposed to disallow Balls deductions of interest expense incurred on loans       under a company-owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than       19years. Ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as       filed and, therefore, no provision for loss has been accrued. The IRSs proposed       adjustments would result in an increase in taxable income for the years 1999       through 2003 of $46.7million and a corresponding increase in taxable       income for subsequent tax years 2004 and 2005 in the amount of       $20.2million with a corresponding increase in tax expense of       $26.4million plus any related penalties and interest expense. The       examination reports for the 2000 to 2003 examination have been forwarded to       the       appeals division of the IRS, and no further action has taken place to change       Balls position.
Results       of Equity Affiliates Equity       in       the earnings of affiliates in 2005 is primarily attributable to our       50percent ownership in packaging investments in North America and Brazil.       Earnings in 2004 included the results of a minority-owned aerospace business,       which was sold in October2005, and a $15.2million loss representing       Balls share of a provision for doubtful accounts related to its 35percent       owned interest in Sanshui JFP (discussed above in International Packaging).       After consideration of the PRC loss, earnings were $15.5million in 2005       compared to $15.8million in 2004 and $11.3million in 2003. The       higher earnings since 2003 were primarily due to improved results in our       packaging joint ventures in Brazil and North America.
Page           25 of           97 Subsequent       Event On       February14, 2006, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement       in which Ball will acquire U.S. Can Corporations (U.S. Can) U.S. and       Argentinean operations for 1.1million sharesof Ball common stock and       the assumption of $550million of U.S. Cans debt. The transaction is       expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2006. U.S. Can is the largest       manufacturer of aerosol cans in the U.S. and also manufactures paint cans,       plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in 10plants in the U.S.       Aerosol cans are also produced in the two manufacturing plants in Argentina.       U.S. Cans U.S. and Argentinean operations had sales of approximately       $600million (unaudited) in 2005. Upon closing the acquisition of U.S. Can,       the company intends to refinance $550million of existing U.S. Can debt at       significantly lower interest rates. The refinancing will be completed with       Balls issuance of a new series of senior notes and an increase in bank debt       under the new senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of       2005.
CRITICAL       AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING       PRONOUNCEMENTS For       information regarding the companys critical and significant policies, as well       as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note1 to the consolidated       financial statements within Item8 of this report.
FINANCIAL       CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash       Flows and Capital Expenditures Cash       flows from operating activities were $558.8million in 2005 compared to       $535.9million in 2004 and $364million in 2003. The lower amount       generated in 2003 included $138.3million for the payment in       January2003 of an accrued withholding tax obligation related to the       acquisition of Ball Packaging Europe (further discussed below) which was funded       by the seller at the time of closing by the inclusion of 131million of       additional cash.
Management       internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1)to evaluate the companys       operating results, (2)for planning purposes, (3)to evaluate       strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and       service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted       accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash       flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines       free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to       property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically       derived directly from the companys cash flow statements; however, it may be       adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. An example of       such       an item excluded in 2003 is the $138.3million withholding tax payment       liability assumed in the acquisition of Ball Packaging Europe in       December2002 (discussed above). We believe this is not a comparable free       cash flow outflow of the company as it was funded by the seller.
Based       on       this, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows: ($                 in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash                 flows from operating activities $ 558.8 $ 535.9 $ 364.0 Add                 back withholding tax payment related to the acquisitionofBall                 Packaging Europe   138.3 Capital                 spending (291.7 ) (196.0 ) (137.2 ) Free                 cash flow $ 267.1 $ 339.9 $ 365.1 Cash       flows from operating activities in 2005 were       negatively impacted by higher cash taxes. This resulted in a decrease in the       deferred income taxes payable of $58.5millionin 2005 compared to an       estimated increase in deferred taxes of $42.8million in 2004. The primary       causes of the increase in current income taxes and decrease in deferred income       taxes are the reduction in 2005 of tax-deductible pension costs versus 2004,       the       impact in 2005 of the repatriation of foreign earnings and a reduction of tax       versus book depreciation expense as tax depreciation was accelerated in prior       years, primarily due to bonus tax depreciation permitted in the tax laws after       September11, 2001. Cash flows from operating activities were positively       affected in 2005 by lower accounts receivable, higher accounts payable and       lower       pension contributions.
Page             26 of             97 Cash       flow       in 2004 compared to 2003 included higher earnings and higher accounts payable,       offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories, as well as higher pension       plan contributions. Inventories and accounts payable were higher due to       increased purchases of raw materials and accounts receivable were higher       partially as a result of strong December food can sales.
Based       on       information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating       activities for 2006 to be approximately $550million, capital spending to       be approximately $300million and free cash flow to be in the       $250million range.
Capital       spending of $291.7million in 2005 was above depreciation and amortization       expense of $213.5million as we invested capital in our best performing       operations, including projects to increase custom can capabilities, improve       beverage can end making productivity, convert lines from steel to aluminum       in       Europe and complete a new beverage can manufacturing plant in Belgrade, Serbia,       as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment.
Debt       Facilities and Refinancing Interest-bearing       debt at December31, 2005, decreased $71million to       $1,589.7million from $1,660.7million at December31, 2004. This       decrease includes $358.1million for net repurchases of common stock and       $291.7million of capital spending, partially offset by the effects of the       lower euro exchange rate and operating cash flow.
On       October13, 2005, Ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities. The       new senior secured facilities extend debt maturities at lower interest rate       spreads and provide Ball with additional borrowing capacity for future growth.       During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, Ball redeemed its 7.75% senior       notes due August 2006 primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new       credit facilities. The refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt       refinancing charge of $19.3million ($12.3million after tax) to       reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off       of       unamortized debt issuance costs.
The       new       senior credit facilities, which currently bear interest at variable rates and       are due in October 2011, are comprised of the following:       (1)85million Term A Loan; (2)350million Term B Loan;       (3)C$165million TermC Loan; (4)a multi-currency       long-term revolving credit facility which provides the company with up to the       equivalent of $715million; and (5)a Canadian long-term revolving       credit facility which provides the company with up to the equivalent of       $35million. At December31, 2005, $547million was available       under the multi-currency revolving credit facility. The company also had       $267million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the       end of the year, of which $106.8million was outstanding.
During       the first quarter of 2004, Ball repaid 31million ($38million) of       its previous euro denominated Term LoanB and reduced the interest rate by       50basis points. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Ball repaid       $160million of its previous U.S. dollar denominated Term LoanB and 25million of its previous euro denominated Term LoanB. At the time       of the early repayment, the interest rate on the U.S. portion of the Term       LoanB was reduced by 50basis points. Interest expense during the       first quarter of 2004 and the fourth quarter of 2003 included $0.5million       and $2.9million, respectively, for the write off of the unamortized       financing costs associated with the repaid loans.
On       August8, 2003, Ball refinanced 8.25%Senior Subordinated Notes due in       2008 through the private placement of $250million of 6.875% Senior Notes       due in 2012 issued at a price of 102% (effective yield to maturity of       6.58percent). In connection with the refinancing of the higher interest       debt, in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of $15.2million was       recorded as interest expense, which consisted of the payment of a       $10.3million call premium and the write off of $4.9million of       unamortized financing costs.
The         company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing,         revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Balls North         American packaging operations, up to $225million as of December31,         2005 ($200million as of December31, 2004). The agreement qualifies         as off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of Statement of Financial         Accounting StandardsNo.140. Net funds received from the sale         of the accounts receivable totaled $210 million and $174.7million at         December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction         of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.
Page             27 of             97 The         company was not in default of any loan agreement at December31, 2005, and         has met all payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement         and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions         relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the         incurrence of additional indebtedness.
Additional       details about the companys receivables sales agreement and debt are available       in Notes5 and 11, respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial       statements within Item 8 of this report.
Other       Liquidity Items Cash       payments required for long-term debt maturities, rental payments under       noncancellable operating leases and purchasing obligations in effect at       December31, 2005, are summarized in the following table: Payments                   Due By Period ($                   in millions) Total Less                   than 1Year 1-3                   Years 3-5                   Years More                   than 5Years Long-term                   debt $ 1,472.4 $ 7.7 $ 105.1 $ 290.4 $ 1,069.2 Capital                   lease obligations 6.7 1.8 2.4 0.5 2.0 Operating                   leases 198.0 45.8 60.6 34.8 56.8 Purchase                   obligations (a) 7,385.4 2,193.8 2,902.6 1,910.7 378.3 Total                   payments on contractual obligations $ 9,062.5 $ 2,249.1 $ 3,070.7 $ 2,236.4 $ 1,506.3 (a) The                 companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum,                 steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. Also included are                 commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace                 and                 technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases                 where                 variable prices and/or usage are involved, managements best estimates                 have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination                 of the                 contracts may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments                 could vary significantly.
Contributions       to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded       German plans, are expected to be $49million in 2006. This estimate may       change based on plan asset performance. Benefit payments related to these plans       are expected to be $43million, $46million, $48million,       $51million and $54million for the years ending December 31, 2006       through 2010, respectively, and $318million thereafter. Payments to       participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be $22million,       $22million, $23million, $24million and $24million for       the years 2006 through 2010, respectively, and a total of $131million       thereafter.
We       increased our share repurchase program in 2005 to $358.1million, net of       issuances, compared to $50million net repurchases in 2004. On       January31, 2005, in a privately negotiated stock repurchase transaction,       Ball entered into a forward purchase agreement to repurchase 3million of       its common shares at an initial price of $42.72 per share using cash on hand       and       available borrowings. The price per share was subject to a price adjustment       based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial       purchase date and the settlement date. The company completed its purchase of       the       3million shares at an average price of $41.63 per share and obtained       delivery of the shares in early May 2005.
On       October26, 2005, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to       12million shares of Ball common stock. This most recent repurchase       authorization replaced the previous authorization of up to 12million       shares approved in July2004, under which approximately 1million       shares remained at October26, 2005.
Annual       cash dividends paid on common stock were       40cents per share in 2005, 35cents per share in 2004 and       24cents per share in 2003. Total dividends paid were $42.5million in       2005, $38.9million in 2004 and $26.8million in 2003.
Page             28 of             97 Contingencies The       company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course       of       business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which       we       participate, our operations in developing markets outside the U.S., changing       commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products       and       changing capital markets. Where practicable, we attempt to reduce these risks       and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and       procedures, including, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments       as       explained in Item 7A of this report.
From       time       to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business.       Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball       as a       potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the       cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does       not       indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the       liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the       company.
Due       to       political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning       beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed       in       January 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in       non-refillable containers. During 2003 and 2004, we responded to the resulting       lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our German plants,       implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from       Germany to other countries in the region served by Ball Packaging Europe. We       also closed a plant in the United Kingdom, shut down a production line in       Germany, delayed capital investment projects in France and Poland and converted       one of our steel can production lines in Germany to aluminum in order to       facilitate additional can exports from Germany. In 2004 the German       parliament adopted a new packaging ordinance, imposing a 25 eurocent deposit       on       all one-way glass, PET and metal containers for water, beer and carbonated       soft       drinks. As of May 1, 2006, all retailers must redeem all returned one-way       containers as long as they sell such containers. Major retailers in Germany       have       begun the process of implementing a returnable system for one-way containers       since they, along with fillers, now appear to accept the deposit as permanent.       The retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a       committee to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers       have       begun to order reverse vending machines in order to meet the May 1, 2006,       deadline.
The       preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted       accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions       that       affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of       contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts       of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future events could affect       these estimates. See Note1 to the consolidated financial statements       (within Item 8 of this report) for a summary of the companys critical and       significant accounting policies.
The       U.S.       and European economies and the company have experienced minor general inflation       during the past several years. Management believes that evaluation of Balls       performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial       statements should be based upon historical financial       statements.
Page           29 of           97 Forward-Looking       Statements The       company has made or implied certain forward-looking statements in this report       which are made as of the end of the time frame covered by this report. These       forward-looking statements represent the companys goals, and results could vary       materially from those expressed or implied. From time to time we also provide       oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to       the       public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward-looking statements       may change. Some factors that could cause the companys actual results or       outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking       statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer       growth and demand; loss of one or more major customers or changes to contracts       with one or more customers; insufficient production capacity; overcapacity       in       foreign and domestic metal and plastic container industry production facilities       and its impact on pricing and financial results; failure to achieve anticipated       productivity improvements or production cost reductions, including those       associated with capital expenditures such as our beverage can end project;       changes in climate and weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power       and       natural resource costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as       gas       and electric power; availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the       recent significant increases in resin, steel, aluminum and energy costs, and       the       ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material       costs; changes in the pricing of the companys products and services;       competition in pricing and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting       therefrom; insufficient or reduced cash flow; transportation costs; the number       and timing of the purchases of the companys common shares; regulatory action or       federal and state legislation including mandated corporate governance and       financial reporting laws; the German mandatory deposit or other restrictive       packaging legislation such as recycling laws; interest rates affecting our       debt;       labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor       costs, including pension, medical and health care costs; rates of return       projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to measure future       obligations and expenses of the companys defined benefit retirement plans;       boycotts; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other litigation;       maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; the effect of LIFO       accounting on earnings; changes in generally accepted accounting principles       or       their interpretation; local economic conditions; the authorization, funding,       availability and returns of contracts for the aerospace and technologies segment       and the nature and continuation of those contracts and related services provided       thereunder; delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules       of performance associated with such segment contracts; international business       and market risks such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies       and the activities of foreign subsidiaries; international business risks       (including foreign exchange rates and activities of foreign subsidiaries) in       Europe and particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil;       changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the European       euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian       dollar, Chinese renminbi and Brazilian real, and in the foreign exchange rate       of       the European euro against the British pound, Polish zloty and Serbian dinar;       terrorist activity or war that disrupts the companys production or supply;       regulatory action or laws including tax, environmental and workplace safety;       technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful       acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities       associated therewith; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits       of       our financial statements or managements evaluation of the companys internal       controls over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income       and       other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and       foreign tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then       the       companys actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or       implied in the forward-looking statements. The company currently does not intend       to publicly update forward-looking statements except as it deems necessary       in       quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult       any       further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K       reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market                 Risk Financial       Instruments and Risk Management In       the       ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies       and       procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest       rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in regard to       common share repurchases. Although the instruments utilized involve varying       degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the       agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the       agreements.
We       have       estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk       exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative       instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the       sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair       value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical       10percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the       sensitivity analysis are summarized below.
Commodity       Price Risk We       manage       our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of       aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts, which generally       include aluminum-based pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under       our       commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. Such terms generally include       a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing. This matched       pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage container net sales.       We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward       contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where       there       is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract.
Our       North       American plastic container sales contracts include provisions to pass through       resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal, if any, exposure       related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most North American food       container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass       through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually       negotiated steel costs. In 2005 and 2004 we were able to pass through the       majority of steel surcharges to our customers.
In       Europe       and Asia the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price       risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials,       as well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the company's exposure       to       fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and       sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing       arrangements. The company also uses forward and option contracts as cash flow       hedges to minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes for those       sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement.
Considering       the effects of derivative instruments, the markets ability to accept price       increases and the companys commodity price exposures, a hypothetical       10percent adverse change in the companys metal prices could result in an       estimated $5.2million after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year       period. Additionally, if foreign currency exchange rates were to change       adversely by 10percent, we estimate there could be an $11.7million       after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period for foreign currency       exposures on the metal. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in       market prices and rates. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related       to       metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and       related payables at our foreign operations, which are subject to foreign       currency fluctuations.
The       company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural       gas and electricity. A hypothetical 10percent increase in our utility       prices could result in an estimated $7.3million after-tax reduction of net       earnings over a one-year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes       in market prices and rates.
Page           31 of           97 Interest       Rate Risk Our       objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact       of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall       borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of interest       rate       swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest       rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, included       pay-fixed and pay-floating interest rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps effectively       convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. The majority of       the       pay-floating swaps, which effectively convert fixed-rate obligations to variable       rate instruments, are fair value hedges.
Based       on       our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2005, assumed floating rate debt       levels throughout 2006 and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100 basis       point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $5.2million       after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year period. Actual results       may       vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these       changes.
Foreign       Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our       objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect       foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes       through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we manage foreign earnings       translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options. Our foreign       currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound,       Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and Serbian       dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of       purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other       currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost       changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement,       the       company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency       exposures.
Considering       the companys derivative financial instruments outstanding at December31,       2005, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10percent reduction in       foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in       an       estimated $19.4million after-tax reduction of net earnings over a one-year       period. This amount includes the $11.7million currency exposure discussed       above in the Commodity Price Risk section. This hypothetical adverse change in       foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt       balance by $63million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ       from hypothetical changes. Sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related       to       metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and       related payables at our foreign operations, which are subject to foreign       currency fluctuations.

Financial                 Statements and Supplementary                 Data Report       of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the       Board       of Directors and Shareholders of Ball Corporation: We       have       completed integrated audits of Ball Corporations2005 and 2004       consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial       reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated       financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company       Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,       are presented below.
Consolidated       financial statements In       our       opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index       appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the       financial position of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31,       2005       and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each       of       the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in       conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States       of       America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys       management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial       statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements       in       accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board       (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit       to       obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free       of       material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining,       on a       test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial       statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates       made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.       We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our       opinion.
Internal       control over financial reporting Also,       in       our opinion, managements assessment, included in Management's Report on       Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing in Item 9A, that the Company       maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December       31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal       Control  Integrated       Framework issued       by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),       is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.       Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,       effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,       based on criteria established in Internal       Control  Integrated Framework issued       by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective       internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the       effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility       is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness       of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.       We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in       accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board       (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit       to       obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over       financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of       internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding       of       internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment,       testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal       control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the       circumstances.

Page           33 of           97 A       companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to       provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting       and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance       with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over       financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain       to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly       reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;       (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as       necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with       generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures       of       the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management       and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance       regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,       or       disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the       financial statements.
Because       of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may       not       prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of       effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become       inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance       with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical and Significant Accounting Policies In       the       application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States       of       America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect       the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingencies       and       reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on       historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable       under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under       different assumptions or conditions.
Critical       Accounting Policies The       company considers certain accounting policies to be critical, as their       application requires managements best judgment in making estimates about the       effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Following is a discussion       of       the accounting policies we consider critical to our consolidated financial       statements.
Revenue       Recognition in the Aerospace and Technologies Segment Sales       under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment are       recognized under the cost-to-cost, percentage-of-completion method. This       business segment sells using two types of long-term sales contracts  cost-plus       sales       contracts, which represent approximately two-thirdsof sales, and fixed       price sales contracts which account for the remainder. A cost-plus sales       contract is an agreement to perform the contract for cost plus an agreed upon       profit component, whereas fixed price sales contracts are completed for a fixed       price or involve the sale of engineering labor at fixed rates per hour.       Cost-plus sales contracts can have different types of fee arrangements,       including fixed fee, cost, schedule and performance incentive fees, award fees       or a combination thereof.
During       initial periods of sales contract performance, our estimates of base, incentive       and other fees are established at a conservative estimate of profit over the       period of contract performance. Throughout the period of contract performance,       we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of total       contract revenue, total contract cost and extent of progress toward completion.       Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period that       such       losses are determined to be probable. Because of sales contract payment       schedules, limitations on funding and contract terms, our sales and accounts       receivable generally include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.       As a prime U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, the aerospace and       technologies segment is subject to a high degree of regulation, financial review       and oversight by the U.S. government.
Goodwill       and Other Intangible Assets We       evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually, and we evaluate our other       intangible assets whenever there is evidence that certain events or changes       in       circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be       recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value approach,       using discounted cash flows to establish fair values. We recognize an impairment       charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its       fair       value. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples       to       corroborate discounted cash flow results. When a business within a reporting       unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition       using the relative fair value methodology.
We       amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless       such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested       for       impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down       to       fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible       assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written       down       to fair value as required.
Page           39 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 1.       Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Defined       Benefit Pension Plans and Other Employee Benefits The       company has defined benefit plans that cover the majority of its employees,       including those at Ball Packaging Europe. We also have postretirement plans       that       provide medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible       dependents. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided       in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for       Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." Both of these statements require       that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of       return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and       expenses, salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend rates and other       assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension       and       postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly       susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan       assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes.       The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic       and market conditions at the time of valuation. However, actual results may       differ substantially from these assumptions.
Pension       plan liabilities are revalued annually based on updated assumptions and       information about the individuals covered by the plan. For pension plans,       accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10percent corridor, the prior       service cost and the transition asset are amortized on a straight-line basis       from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active       participants. For other postemployment benefits, the 10percent corridor is       not used.
In       addition to defined benefit and postretirement plans, the company maintains       reserves for employee medical claims, up to our insurance stop-loss limit,       and       workers compensation claims. These are regularly evaluated and revised, as       needed, based on a variety of information including historical experience,       third       party actuarial estimates and current employee statistics.
Taxes       on Income Deferred       tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carry       forwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of       management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes       will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess       the       need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments       from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities that regularly audit       the       company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments,       management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions,       including many foreign jurisdictions.
Deferred       income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the       tax       bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each       balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income       tax       expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the financial       statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the       amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and       expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in       different time periods by taxing authorities.

Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Business       Consolidation Costs The       company estimates its liabilities for business consolidation activities by       accumulating detailed estimates of costs and asset sales proceeds, if any,       for       each business consolidation initiative. This includes the estimated costs of       employee severance, pension and related benefits, impairment of property and       equipment and other assets, including estimates of realizable value, contract       termination payments for leases, contractual obligations and any other       qualifying costs related to the exit plan. These estimated costs are grouped       by       specific projects within the overall exit plan and are then monitored on a       monthly basis. Such disclosures represent management's best estimates, but       require assumptions about the plans that may change over time. Changes in       estimates for individual locations are evaluated periodically to determine       if a       change in estimate is required for the overall restructuring plan. Subsequent       changes to the original estimates are included in current period earnings and       identified as business consolidation gains or losses.
Significant       Accounting Policies Principles       of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The       consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ball Corporation       and       its controlled subsidiaries (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our). Equity       investments in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control       and       are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method       of       accounting. Investments in which we do not exercise significant influence over       the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Intercompany       transactions are eliminated.
Cash       Equivalents Cash       equivalents have original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories Inventories       are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of the aluminum component       of       U.S. metal beverage container inventories and substantially all inventories       within the U.S. metal food container businessare determined using the       last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting. The cost of remaining       inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) average cost       method of accounting.
Depreciation       and Amortization Property,       plant and equipmentare carried at the cost of acquisition or construction       and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation       and       amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient       to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings       and improvements - 15 to 40years; machinery and equipment - 5 to       15years; other intangible assets - 7.3 years, weighted       average).
Deferred       financing costs are amortized over the life of the related loan facility and       are       reported as part of interest expense. When debt is repaid prior to its maturity       date, the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs is       also reported as interest expense.
Page           41 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 1.       Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Environmental       Reserves We       estimate the liability related to environmental matters based on, among other       factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability       to       make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. We record our best estimate       of       a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes       available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matters       and       revise our estimates.
Revenue       Recognition in the Packaging Segments Sales       of       products in the packaging segments are recognized when delivery has occurred       and       title has transferred, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or       arrangement, the price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably       assured.
Stock-Based       Compensation Ball       has       a variety of restricted stock and stock option plans. With the exception of       the       companys deposit share program, which through 2005 has been accounted for as a       variable plan and is discussed in Note 14, the compensation cost associated       with       restricted stock grants has been calculated using the fair value at the date       of       grant and amortized over the restriction period. Expense related to stock       options has been calculated using the intrinsic value method under the       guidelines of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, and has       therefore not been included in the consolidated statements of earnings. Balls       earnings as reported include after-tax stock-based compensation of       $6.6million, $12.5million and $7.6million for the years ended       December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. If the fair value based       method had been used, after-tax stock-based compensation would have been       $8.7million in 2005, $9.3million in 2004 and $8.8million in       2003, and diluted earnings per share would have been lower by $0.02 in 2005,       higher by $0.03 in 2004 and lower by $0.01 in 2003. Further details regarding       the expense calculated under the fair value based method are provided in       Note14. Effective January1, 2006, the company adopted       SFASNo.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (see the discussion       of this new standard in theNew Accounting Pronouncements section).
Foreign       Currency Translation Assets       and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange       rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates       during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated       other comprehensive earnings as a component of shareholders equity.
Derivative       Financial Instruments The       company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging       exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,       product sales, raw materials purchasing and common share repurchases. The       companys derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets       at fair value. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a recognized       asset or liability, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period       of       change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable       to the risk being hedged. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge,       or a       derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a firm commitment not yet       recorded on the balance sheet, the effective portion of the derivative's gain       or       loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive       earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted       transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss       associated with all hedges is reported in earnings immediately.
Page           42 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 1.       Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Realized       gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent       with the accounting treatment of the item being hedged. Gains and losses upon       the early termination of effective derivative contracts are deferred in       accumulated other comprehensive earnings and amortized to earnings in the same       period as the originally hedged items affect earnings.
Reclassifications Certain       prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current       year presentation.
New       Accounting Pronouncements In       May2005 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS       No.154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a Replacement of APB       Opinion No.20 and FASBStatement No.3. The new standard       changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in       accounting principle and applies to all such voluntary changes. The previous       accounting required that most changes in accounting principle be recognized       in       net earnings by including a cumulative effect of the change in the period of       the       change. SFASNo. 154, which will be effective for Ball beginning       January1, 2006, requires retroactive application to prior periods financial statements.
In       December 2004 the FASB issued SFASNo.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. SFASNo.123 (revised2004) is a revision       of SFASNo.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and       supersedes APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The new standard, which will be effective for Ball beginning January1,       2006, establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity       exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, including stock option       and restricted stock grants. On March29, 2005, the Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.107, which       summarizes the views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS       No.       123 (revised 2004) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the SEC       staffs views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for       public companies. Upon adoption of SFASNo.123 (revised 2004), Ball       anticipates using the modified prospective transition method and, at least       initially, the Black-Scholes valuation model. The incremental expense associated       with the adoption of SFASNo.123 (revised 2004) for unvested stock       option and deposit share program restricted stock grants existing at       December31, 2005, is expected to be insignificant. Actual 2006 expense       will vary based on additional grants made during 2006.
In       November2004 the FASB issued SFAS No.151, Inventory Costs - an       amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter4. SFAS No.151 requires abnormal       amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material       (spoilage) to be recognized as current-period charges. It also requires that       the       allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based       on       the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No.151 will be       effective for inventory costs incurred by Ball beginning on January1,       2006. Ball believes that the potential future impact, if any, of       SFASNo.151 will not be significant to its consolidated financial       statements.
Page           43 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 2.       Business Segment Information The       company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized       alonga combination ofproduct lines and geographic areas- North       American metal beverage packaging, North American metal food packaging, North       American plastic packaging, international packaging and aerospace and       technologies. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.       We       also have investments in the packaging segments that are accounted for under       the       equity method of accounting, and, accordingly, those results are not included       in       segment sales or earnings. The accounting policies of the segments are the       same       as those described in the summary of critical and significant accounting       policies (Note1). See also Notes 3 and 4 for information regarding       transactions affecting segment results.
North       American Metal Beverage Packaging The       North       American metal beverage packaging segment consists of operations in the U.S.,       Canada and Puerto Rico, which manufacture metal containers primarily for use       in       beverage packaging.

3.       Acquisitions Ball       Western Can Company (Ball Western Can) On       March17, 2004, Ball acquired ConAgra Grocery Products Companys (ConAgra)       interest in Ball Western Can for $30 million. Ball Western Can, located in       Oakdale, California, was established in 2000 as a 50/50 joint venture between       Ball and ConAgra and, prior to the acquisition, was accounted for by Ball using       the equity method of accounting. The acquisition has been accounted for as       a       purchase, and accordingly, its results have been consolidated in our financial       statements from the acquisition date. Contemporaneous with the acquisition,       Ball       and ConAgras parent company, ConAgra Foods Inc., entered into a long-term       agreement under which Ball provides metal food containers to ConAgra       manufacturing locations in California. The acquisition of Ball Western Can       was       not significant to the company.
Metal       Packaging International (MPI) On       March11, 2003, Ball acquired MPI, a manufacturer of ends for aluminum       beverage cans, for $28million. MPI produced just over 2billion ends       per year, primarily for carbonated soft drink companies, and had sales of       $42million in 2002. The MPI plant was closed during the second quarter of       2003 and sold in October2004, with its manufacturing volumes being       consolidated into other Ball facilities. The acquisition of MPI was not       significant to the company.

A pretax charge of $19.3million       ($11.7million after tax) was recorded in the third quarter of 2005 in       connection with this project. The pretax charge includes $11.7 million for       employee severance, pension and other employee benefit costs, $1.6million       for decommissioning costs and $6million for the write off of obsolete       equipment spare parts and tooling. Payments made in 2005 were       insignificant.
North       American Metal Food Packaging The       fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $4.6million       ($3.1million after tax) for pension, severance and other employee benefit       costs related to a reduction in force in our Burlington, Ontario, plant.       Payments made in 2005 were insignificant.
A       pretax       charge of $8.8million ($5.9million after tax) was recorded in the       second quarter of 2005 in connection with the closure of a three-piece food       can       manufacturing plant in Quebec, Canada. The Quebec plant was closed and ceased       operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached to       sell the land and building which resulted in the second quarter charge being       offset by a $2.2million gain ($1.5million after tax) in the fourth       quarter to adjust the Quebec plant to net realizable value. At December31,       2005, the resulting reserve had been reduced by $1.9million of cash       payments made. The pretax charge, net of the offsetting gain, included       $3.2million for employee severance, pension and other employee benefit       costs and $3.4million for decommissioning cost and the write-down to net       realizable value of fixed assets and other costs. When all assets are disposed       of, management expects the plant closure to result in a net cash inflow. A       total       of 77employees were terminated in connection with the       closure.

Business Consolidation Activities (continued) The       following table summarizes the activity in the 2005 North American business       consolidation activities: ($                 in millions) Fixed                 Assets/ Spare                 Parts Pension Costs Employee Costs Other Total CCharge                 (earnings) to North American segments: Second                 quarter 2005 $ 4.8 $ 0.5 $ 2.6 $ 0.9 $ 8.8 Third                 quarter 2005 6.0 4.7 7.0 1.6 19.3 Fourth                 quarter 2005 (2.2 ) 2.7 1.9  2.4 PaPayments   (1.7 ) (0.5 ) (2.2 ) DiDisposal                 of spare parts (1.4 )    (1.4 ) TrTransfers                 to assets and liabilities to reflect estimated realizablevalues and                 foreign exchange effects (1.6 ) (7.9 ) 0.2  (9.3 ) Balance                 at December31, 2005 $ 5.6 $  $ 10.0 $ 2.0 $ 17.6 The       remaining carrying value of fixed assets remaining for sale in connection with       the 2005 North American business consolidation activities was $5.3million       at December31, 2005.
International       Packaging The       company recorded $9.3million of earnings in 2005, primarily related to the       final settlement of tax obligations, and an adjustment to reclassify an asset       to       be put in service previously held for sale, related to a $237.7 million business       consolidation charge taken in the second quarter of 2001. Tax clearances from       the applicable authorities were required during the formal liquidation process.       These matters have been concluded.
2004 North       American Metal Food Packaging In       the       fourth quarter of 2004, a gain of $0.4million was recorded, as costs were       less than estimated for the 2003 closure of a metal food container plant.
North       American Plastic Packaging In       the       third quarter, earnings of $0.7 million were recorded as costs related to the       shut down and relocation of the Atlanta plastics offices and research and       development (R&D) facility were less than expected. The office relocation       was completed during 2003 and the R&D facility relocation was completed in       2004.
International       Packaging The       company recorded $13.7million of earnings in 2004, primarily related to       the realization of assets in the PRC in excess of amounts previously estimated,       and costs of consolidation and liquidation less than anticipated, related to       a       $237.7 million business consolidation charge taken in the second quarter of       2001.
Aerospace       and Technologies Earnings       of $0.4 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 for exit costs       that       were no longer required due to the sale of a product line whose operations       ceased in 2001.

Business Consolidation Activities (continued) 2003 North       American Metal Beverage A       gain of       $1.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale,       and       the completion of the consolidation activities, related to a metal beverage       container plant closed in December 2001.
North       American Metal Food In       the       first quarter Ball announced plans to close a metal food container plant to       address decreased demand for three-piece welded cans. In connection with the       closure, a charge of $1.9million was recorded, partially offset by a       $0.5million gain on the sale of a Canadian plant that was included in a       business consolidation charge taken in 2000. The $1.9million charge       included $0.8million for employee severance and benefit costs and       $1.1million for decommissioning costs and an impairment charge on fixed       assets.
International       Packaging Ball       Packaging Europe closed its plant in Runcorn, England, at the end of December       2003. The cost of the plant closure, along with costs associated with a line       conversion and a line shut down at other plants, estimated to be 11.9million in total, was accounted for in the opening acquisition       balance sheet. These costs included 8.7million for employee termination       costs and 3.2million for decommissioning costs, of which 10.5 million       was paid and 0.6million was reversed to goodwill as costs were less than       initially estimated. The remaining balance of 0.8million is for early       retirement benefits to be paid under local law in future periods. There are       no       remaining assets held for sale at December31, 2005.
The       company recorded $3.3million of earnings in 2003, primarily related to the       realization of assets in the PRC in excess of amounts previously estimated,       and       costs of consolidation and liquidation less than anticipated, related to a       $237.7 million business consolidation charge taken in the second quarter of       2001.
Aerospace       and Technologies Earnings       of $0.2million in the third quarter of 2003 for exit costs that were no       longer required due to the sale of a product line whose operations ceased in       2001.
5.       Accounts Receivable Accounts       receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $13.4million       at December31, 2005, and $17.1million at December31,       2004.
A       receivables sales agreement provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a       designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Balls North American packaging       operations of up to $225million (increased during the third quarter of       2005 from the previous limit of $200 million). The agreement qualifies as       off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of SFASNo.140. Net       funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled       $210million and $174.7million at December31, 2005 and 2004,       respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the       consolidated balance sheets. Fees incurred in connection with the sale of       accounts receivable, which are reported as part of selling, general and       administrative expenses, totaled $7.7million in 2005, $3.2million in       2004 and $2.5million in 2003.

Accounts Receivable (continued) Net       accounts receivable under long-term contracts, due primarily from agencies       of       the U.S. government and their prime contractors, were $121.7million and       $85.8million at December31,2005 and 2004, respectively, and       included $70.8million and $60.6million, respectively, representing       the recognized sales value of performance that had not been billed and were       not       yet billable to customers. The average length of the long-term contracts is       three years and the average length remaining on those contracts at       December31, 2005, was 12months. Approximately $3million of       unbilled receivables at December31,2005, is expected to be collected       after one year and is related to customary fees and cost withholdings that       will       be paid upon milestone or contract completions, as well as final overhead rate       settlements.
6.       Inventories December 31 , ($                 in millions) 2005 2004 Raw                 materials and supplies $ 277.4 $ 256.5 Work                 in process and finished goods 392.9 373.0 $ 670.3 $ 629.5 Approximately       34percent and 32percent of total inventories at       December31,2005 and 2004, respectively, were valued using the LIFO       method of accounting. Inventories at December31,2005 and 2004, would       have been $29.6million and $12.1million higher, respectively, than       the reported amounts if the FIFO method of accounting, which approximates       replacement cost, had been used for those inventories.
7.       Property, Plant and Equipment December 31 , ($                 in millions) 2005 2004 Land $ 81.1 $ 81.7 Buildings 804.3 735.4 Machinery                 and equipment 2,268.0 2,157.4 3,153.4 2,974.5 Accumulated                 depreciation (1,596.8 ) (1,442.1 ) $ 1,556.6 $ 1,532.4 Property,       plant and equipment are stated at historical cost. Depreciation expense amounted       to $202.1million, $202.8million and $193million for the years       ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The change in the net       property, plant and equipment balance during 2005 is the result of capital       spending offset by depreciation and changes in foreign currency exchange       rates.
During       2003 the company entered into capital leases totaling $6.7million. The       acquisitions of equipment under these capital leases were noncash transactions       and, accordingly, have been excluded from the consolidated statement of cash       flows.

There was no impairment of goodwill in 2005, 2004 or 2003. The       decrease in goodwill due to purchase accounting adjustments primarily relates       to       the reduction of the remaining goodwill associated with the deferred taxes       on       foreign earnings that decreased as a result of the repatriation of the foreign       earnings (see Note12).
9.       Intangibles and Other Assets December 31 , ($                 in millions) 2005 2004 Intangibles                 and Other Assets: Investments                 in affiliates $ 65.4 $ 83.1 Prepaid                 pension and related intangible asset 42.3 48.0 Other                 intangibles (net of accumulated amortization of $52.6 and$44                 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively) 43.1 58.2 Deferred                 tax asset 40.7  Other 110.9 100.4 $ 302.4 $ 289.7 Total       amortization expense of other intangible assets amounted to $11.4million,       $12.3million and $12.5million for the years ended December31,       2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Based on intangible assets and foreign       currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2005, total annual intangible asset       amortization expense is expected to be between $9.7million and       $11.1million in each of the years 2006 through 2009 and $1.1million       in 2010.
In       the       first quarter of 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses included       $3.8million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity       investment in an aerospace company. The remaining carrying amount of       $14million was reclassified to other current assets and was sold in       October2005 for $7million cash and a $7.2million       interest-bearing note due April2007. Also included in the first quarter of       2005 was an expense of $3.4million for the full write off of a PRC equity       investment in a joint venture. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company       recorded a $15.2million equity earnings loss from the same joint venture       related to a bad debt provision. Information learned late in the first quarter       of 2005 led the company to conclude that it does not expect to recover the       remaining carrying value of this investment.

Leases The       company leases warehousing and manufacturing space and certain equipment,       primarily within the packaging segments, and office and technical space,       primarily within the aerospace and technologies segment. During 2005 and 2003       we       entered into leases which qualify as operating leases for book purposes and       capital leases for tax purposes. Under these lease arrangements, Ball has the       option to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term, or if       we       elect not to do so, to compensate the lessors for the difference between the       guaranteed minimum residual values totaling $16.3million and the fair       market value of the assets, if less. Certain of the companys leases in effect       at December31, 2005, include renewal options and/or escalation clauses for       adjusting lease expense based on various factors.
Total       noncancellable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2005, require rental       payments of $45.8million, $35.3million, $25.3million,       $19.4million and $15.4million for the years 2006 through 2010,       respectively, and $56.8million combined for all years thereafter. Lease       expense for all operating leases was $74million, $71.3million and       $64.8million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Debt and Interest Costs Short-term       debt at December31, 2005, includes $106.8million outstanding under       uncommitted bank facilities totaling $267million. At December31,       2004, $43.7million was outstanding under uncommitted bank facilities       totaling $234million. The weighted average interest rate of the       outstanding short-term facilities was 3.9percent at December31,       2005, and 3.26percent at December31, 2004.

Debt and Interest Costs (continued) 2005 On       October13,2005, Ball refinanced its senior secured credit       facilities. The new senior secured credit facilities extend debt maturities       at       lower interest rate spreads and provide Ball with additional borrowing capacity       for future growth. During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, Ball redeemed       its 7.75% senior notes due in August 2006. The refinancing and senior note       redemptions resulted in a debt refinancing charge of $19.3million       ($12.3million after tax) for the related call premium and unamortized debt       issuance costs.
The       new       senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and also include       (1)a multi-currency, long-term revolving credit facility which provides       the company with up to the equivalent of $715million and (2)a       Canadian long-term revolving credit facility which provides the company with       up       to the equivalent of $35million. Both revolving credit facilities expire       in October2011. At December31, 2005, taking into account outstanding       letters of credit, $547million was available under the revolving credit       facilities.
Maturities       of all long-term debt obligations outstanding at December 31, 2005, are       $9.5million, $32.2million, $75.3million, $85.2million       and $205.7million for the years ending December 31, 2006 through 2010,       respectively, and $1,071.2million thereafter. Ball provides letters of       credit in the ordinary course of business to secure liabilities recorded in       connection with industrial development revenue bonds and certain self-insurance       arrangements. Letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004,       were       $34million and $43million, respectively.
The       notes       payable and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional       and       joint and several basis by certain of the companys domestic wholly owned       subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior credit       facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the companys wholly owned       foreign subsidiaries. Note19 contains further details as well as       condensed, consolidating financial information for the company, segregating       the       guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries.
The       company was not in default of any loan agreement at December 31, 2005, and       has       met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit       agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain       restrictions relating to dividend payments, share repurchases, investments,       financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.
2004 During       the first quarter of 2004, Ball repaid 31million ($38million) of       its previous euro denominated Term LoanB and reduced the interest rate by       50basis points. Interest expense during the first quarter of 2004 included       $0.5million for the write off of the unamortized financing costs       associated with the repaid loans.
2003 On       August8, 2003, Ball refinanced 8.25%Senior Subordinated Notes due in       2008 through the placement of $250million of 6.875% Senior Notes due in       2012 issued at a price of 102% (effective yield to maturity of       6.58percent). In connection with the refinancing of the higher interest       debt, in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of $15.2million was       recorded as interest expense, which consisted of the payment of a       $10.3million call premium and the write off of $4.9million of       unamortized financing costs. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Ball repaid       $160million of its previous U.S. dollar denominated Term LoanB and 25million of the euro denominated Term LoanB. At the time of the       early repayment, the interest rate on the U.S. portion of the Term LoanB       was reduced by 50basis points. Interest expense during the fourth quarter       of 2003 included $2.9million for the write off of the unamortized       financing costs associated with the repaid loans.

Under the       terms of the holiday, an exemption was granted on manufacturing earnings for       up       to 39.5million of income tax. At December31, 2005, the remaining       tax holiday available to reduce future Polish tax liability was 5.5million. In 2005 Ball Packaging Europes Serbian subsidiary was       granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, the earnings of this       subsidiary will be exempt from income taxation for a period of 10years       beginning with the first year the Serbian subsidiary has taxable earnings.
Net       income tax payments were $99million, $72.6million and       $28.4million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

At       December31, 2005, Ball Packaging Europe and subsidiaries had net operating       loss carryforwards, with no expiration date, of $52million with a related       tax benefit of $14.8million. Due to the uncertainty of ultimate       realization, that benefit has been offset by a valuation allowance of       $4.8million. Any realization of the valuation allowance will be recognized       as a reduction in goodwill. At December31, 2005, the company has foreign       tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $5.8million; however, due to the       uncertainty of realization of the entire credit, a valuation allowance of       $3.8million has been applied to reduce the carrying value to $2       million.
On       October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act) was       signed into law. The Jobs Act provides certain domestic companies a temporary       opportunity to repatriate previously undistributed earnings of controlled       foreign subsidiaries at a reduced federal tax rate, approximating       5.25percent. The reduced rate is achieved via an 85percent dividends       received deduction on earnings repatriated during a one-year period on or before       December 31, 2005. To qualify for the deduction, the repatriated earnings must       be reinvested in the United States pursuant to one or more domestic reinvestment       plans approved, in advance of distribution, by the company's chief executive       officer (CEO) and subsequently approved by the company's board of directors.       Certain other criteria in the Jobs Act were satisfied as well.
Page           58 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 12.       Taxes on Income (continued) In       July       2005 the companys CEO approved a foreign dividend and capital distribution plan       that included the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain of its       foreign subsidiaries during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. The       applicable domestic reinvestment plans were approved by the CEO, in advance       of       distributions, and subsequently approved by the board of directors as required       under the Jobs Act. Under the plan, the distribution was $488.4 million, of       which approximately $320.3 million is taxable and subject to the provisions       of       the Jobs Act. The company recorded a current tax payable of $16 million that       was       more than offset by the release of $19.2 million of accrued taxes on prior       year       unremitted foreign earnings, resulting in a net decrease in tax expense of       $3.2       million.
Notwithstanding       the 2005 distribution pursuant to the Jobs Act, managements intention is to       indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Subsequent to the aforementioned Jobs       Act distribution, substantially all of the previously undistributed earnings       of       Balls controlled foreign corporations have been distributed; therefore, no       deferred tax provision would be required at December 31, 2005.
As       previously reported in the companys 2004 Annual Report on Form10-K, in       connection with the Internal Revenue Services examination of Balls       consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2003, the IRS       has       proposed to disallow Balls deductions of interest expense incurred on loans       under a company-owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than       19years. Ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as       filed and, therefore, no provision for loss has been accrued. The IRSs proposed       adjustments would result in an increase in taxable income for the years 1999       through 2003 of $46.7million and a corresponding increase in taxable       income for subsequent tax years 2004 and 2005 in the amount of       $20.2million with a corresponding increase in aggregate tax expense of       $26.4million plus any related interest expense and penalties. The       examination reports for the 2000 to 2003 examinations have been forwarded to       the       appeals division of the IRS, and no further action has taken place to change       Balls position.

The defined benefit plans       for salaried employees, as well as those for hourly employees in Germany and       the       United Kingdom, provide pension benefits based on employee compensation and       years of service. Plans for North American hourly employees provide benefits       based on fixed rates for each year of service. The German plans are not funded       but the company maintains book reserves and annual additions to the reserves       are       generally tax deductible. With the exception of the German plans, our policy       is       to fund the plans on a current basis to the extent deductible under existing       tax       laws and regulations and in amounts at least sufficient to satisfy statutory       funding requirements. We also have defined benefit pension obligations in France       and Austria, the assets and liabilities of which are       insignificant.

The decrease from 2004 to 2005 is partially                 the                 result of changes in foreign currency exchange                 rates.

In addition, changes in the discount rate assumption should reflect changes       in       the general level of interest rates.

Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) In       selecting the U.S. discount rate for December 31, 2005,several benchmarks       were considered to provide guidance.These benchmarks included Moody's       long-term corporate bond yield forAa bonds and the Citigroup Pension       Liability Index. In addition, the expected cash flows from the plans were       modeled relative to the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matched to cash       flows from a portfolio of bonds rated Aa or better.In Canada the markets       for locally denominated high-quality, longer term corporate bonds are relatively       thin. As a result, the approach taken in Canada is to use yield curve spot       rates       to discount the respective benefit cash flows and to compute the underlying       constant bond yield equivalent. The Canadian discount rate at December31,       2005, was selected based on a review of the expected benefit payments for each       of the Canadian defined benefit plans over the next 60 years and then       discounting the resulting cash flows to the measurement date using the AA       corporate bond spot rates to determine the equivalent level discount rate.       In       the United Kingdom and Germany, the company and its actuarial consultants       considered the applicable iBoxx 15+ year AA corporate bond yields for the       respective markets and determined a rate in line with those expectations. In       all       countries, the discount rates selected for December 31, 2005, were based on       therange of values obtained from cash flow specific methods, together with       the changes in the general level of interest rates reflected by the       benchmarks.
The       assumption related to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets       reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide       for the benefits over the life of the plans. The assumption is based upon Balls       pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of       investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance was       placed on historical asset returns of our plans. An asset-return generation       model was used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class       correlation. The analysis includes expected future risk premiums,       forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds       and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indexes, expected inflation       and real risk-free interest rate assumptions, and the funds expected asset       allocation.
The       expected long-term rates of return on assets are calculated by applying the       expected rate of return to a market related value of plan assets at the       beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted average expected contributions       and benefit payments. For the North American plans, the market related value       of       plan assets used to calculate expected return was $662.4million for 2005,       $604.4million for 2004 and $570.4million for 2003.
Included       in other comprehensive earnings, net of related tax effect, were increases       in       the minimum liability of $43.6million and $33.2million in 2005 and       2004, respectively, and a decrease of $11.8million in 2003.
For       pension plans, accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10percent       corridor and the prior service cost are being amortized over the average       remaining service period of active participants.
Defined       Benefit Pension Plan Assets Investment       policies and strategies for the plan assets in the U.S., Canada and the United       Kingdom are established by pension investment committees and include the       following common themes: (1) to provide for long-term growth of principal income       without undue exposure to risk; (2) to minimize contributions to the plans;       (3)       to minimize and stabilize pension expense; and (4) to achieve a rate of return       which is above the market average for each asset class over the long term.       The       pension investment committees are required to regularly, but no less frequently       than once annually, review asset mix and asset performance, as well as the       performance of the investment managers. Based on their reviews, which are       generally conducted quarterly, investment policies and strategies are revised       as       appropriate.

Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Target       asset allocations in the U.S. and Canada are set using a minimum and maximum       range for each asset category as a percent of the total funds market value.       Assets contributed to the United Kingdom plans are invested using established       percentages. Following are the target asset allocations established as of       December31, 2005: U.S.

(b) Debt                 securities may include up to 10percent high yield non-investment                 grade bonds and up to 15percent international                 bonds.
(c) May                 include between 15percent and 35percent non-Canadian equity                 securities and must remain within the Canadian tax law for foreign                 property limits.
(d) Equity                 securities must consist of United Kingdom securities and up to                 29percent foreign                 securities.
The       actual weighted average asset allocations for Balls defined benefit pension       plans, which are within the established targets for each country, were as       follows at December31: 2005 2004 C                 Cash and cash equivalents 1 % 1 % Equity                 securities 62 % 66 % Fixed                 income securities 32 % 31 % Other 5 % 2 % 100 % 100 % Contributions       to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded       German plans, are expected to be $49million in 2006. This estimate may       change based on plan asset performance. Benefit payments related to these plans       are expected to be $43million, $46million, $48million,       $51million and $54million for the years ending December 31, 2006       through 2010, respectively, and $318million thereafter. Payments to       participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be $22million in       2006, $22million, $23million, $24million and $24million       in the years 2006 through 2010, respectively, and a total of $131million       thereafter.
Other       Postemployment Benefits The       company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution postretirement health       care and life insurance plans for substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees.       Employees may also qualify for long-term disability, medical and life insurance       continuation and other postemployment benefits upon termination of active       employment prior to retirement. All of the Ball-sponsored postretirement health       care and life insurance plans are unfunded and, with the exception of life       insurance benefits, are self-insured.
In       Canada, the company provides supplemental medical and other benefits in       conjunction with Canadian provincial health care plans. Most U.S. salaried       employees who retired prior to 1993 are covered by noncontributory defined       benefit medical plans with capped lifetime benefits. Ball provides a fixed       subsidy toward each retiree's future purchase of medical insurance for U.S.       salaried and substantially all nonunion hourly employees retiring after January       1, 1993. Life insurance benefits are noncontributory. Ball has no commitments       to       increase benefits provided by any of the postemployment benefit       plans.

For other postemployment benefits, accumulated gains and losses,       the prior service cost and the transition asset are being amortized over the       average remaining service period of active participants.
For       the       U.S. health care plans at December31, 2005, a 10percent health care       cost trend rate was used for pre-65 and post-65 benefits, and trend rates were       assumed to decrease by 1percent per year until 2011 when they reach       5percent and remain level thereafter. For the Canadian plans, a       10percent health care cost trend rate was used, which was assumed to       decrease in one-half percent increments to 5percent by 2016 and remain at       that level in subsequent years.
Health       care cost trend rates can have an effect on the amounts reported for the health       care plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend       rates       would increase or decrease the total of service and interest cost by       approximately $0.5million and the postemployment benefit obligation by       approximately $8million to $9million.

Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Other       Benefit Plans The       company matches employee contributions to the 401(k) plan with shares of Ball       common stock, up to 50percent of up to 6percent of a participants       annual salary. The expense associated with the company match amounted to       $14.3million, $13million and $11.7million for 2005, 2004 and       2003, respectively.
In       addition, substantially all employees within the companys aerospace and       technologies segment who participate in Balls 401(k) plan receive a       performance-based matching cash contribution of up to 4percent of base       salary. The company recognized $6.3million, $4.8million and       $6million of additional compensation expense related to this program for       the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In       2005       the companys 401(k) plan matching contributions could not exceed $7,000 per       employee due to the 401(k) aggregate limit on employee contributions of       $14,000.
14.       Shareholders Equity At       December 31, 2005, the company had 550million shares of common stock and       15 million shares of preferred stock authorized, both without par value.       Preferred stock includes 120,000 authorized but unissued shares designated       as       Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
On       January31, 2005, in a privately negotiated stock repurchase transaction,       Ball entered into a forward purchase agreement to repurchase 3million of       its common shares at an initial price of $42.72 per share using cash on hand       and       available borrowings. The price per share was subject to a price adjustment       based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial       purchase date and the settlement date. The company previously reported in its       Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2004, within       Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and       Results of Operations and Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary       Data, that the purchase of the 3million shares occurred on       January31, 2005, with the immediate reduction of Balls outstanding       shares. The reduction of shares was reflected in the number of outstanding       shares disclosed on the cover page of the Form10-K. Subsequent to the       close of the first quarter, the company, upon further review of the transaction,       concluded that the shares purchased under the contract should not reduce the       outstanding shares, nor affect earnings per share, until actual delivery of       the       shares to the company. The company completed its purchase of the 3million       shares at an average price of $41.63per share and obtained delivery of the       shares in early May 2005.
On       October26, 2005, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to       12million shares of Ball common stock. This most recent repurchase       authorization replaced the previous authorization of up to 12million       shares approved in July2004, under which approximately 1million       shares remained at October26, 2005.
On       July       28, 2004, the companys board of directors declared a two-for-one split of       Balls common stock. The stock split was effective August23, 2004, for all       shareholders of record on August 4, 2004. As a result of the stock split, all       amounts prior to the split related to earnings, options and outstanding shares       have been retroactively restated as if the split had occurred as of       January1, 2003.
Page           66 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 14.       Shareholders Equity (continued) Under       the       company's successor Shareholder Rights Plan, one Preferred Stock Purchase Right       (Right) is attached to each outstanding share of Ball Corporation common stock.       Subject to adjustment, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase       from the company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating       Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $130 per Right. If a person or group       acquires 15percent or more of the company's outstanding common stock (or       upon occurrence of certain other events), the Rights (other than those held       by       the acquiring person) become exercisable and generally entitle the holder to       purchase shares of Ball Corporation common stock at a 50 percent discount.       The       Rights, which expire in 2006, are redeemable by the company at a redemption       price of one cent per Right and trade with the common stock. Exercise of such       Rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to       acquire control of the company without the approval of Ball's board of       directors. The Rights would not interfere with any merger or other business       combinations approved by the board of directors.
As       a       result of the companys stock split, which was distributed on August23,       2004, the rights attaching to the shares (pursuant to the Rights agreement       dated       January24, 1996) automatically split so that one-quarter of a right       attached to each share of Ball Corporation common stock outstanding upon the       effective date of the stock split. Ball previously split the companys common       stock on February22, 2002.
In       connection with the employee stock purchase plan, the company contributes       20percent of up to $500 of each participating employees monthly payroll       deduction toward the purchase of Ball Corporation common stock. Company       contributions for this plan were $3.2million in 2005, $2.7million in       2004 and $2.5million in 2003.
Accumulated       Other Comprehensive Earnings (Loss) The       activity related to accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) was as       follows: ($                 in millions) Foreign Currency                 Translation Minimum Pension Liability, Net                 of Tax Effective Financial                 Derivatives, Net                 of Tax Accumulated Other                 Comprehensive Earnings (Loss) December                 31, 2002 $ (22.9 ) $ (104.9 ) $ (10.5 ) $ (138.3 ) 2003                 change 103.6 11.8 21.5 136.9 December                 31, 2003 80.7 (93.1 ) 11.0 (1.4 ) 2004                 change 68.2 (33.2 ) (0.4 ) 34.6 December                 31, 2004 148.9 (126.3 ) 10.6 33.2 2005                 change (74.3 ) (43.6 ) (16.0 ) (133.9 ) December                 31, 2005 $ 74.6 $ (169.9 ) $ (5.4 ) $ (100.7 ) Notwithstanding       the 2005 distribution pursuant to the Jobs Act, managements intention is to       indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Therefore, no taxes have been provided       on the foreign currency translation component for any period. The change in       the       minimum pension liability is presented net of related tax benefit of       $27.3million for 2005, related tax benefit of $20.8million for 2004       and related tax expense of $7.7million for 2003.
Stock       Options and Restricted Shares The       company has several stock option plans under which options to purchase shares       of       common stock have been granted to officers and key employees at the market       value       of the stock at the date of grant. Payment must be made at the time of exercise       in cash or with shares of stock owned by the option holder, which are valued       at       fair market value on the date exercised. Options issued through       December31, 2005, terminate 10 years from date of grant. Commencing one       year from date of grant, options vest in four equal annual       amounts.

Shareholders Equity (continued) On       October26, 2005, Balls board of directors approved the acceleration of       the out-of-the-money, unvested nonqualified stock options grants in       April2005. The acceleration affects approximately 665,000options       granted to approximately 290employees at an exercise price of $39.74. The       accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options will allow the company to       eliminate approximately $5million of pretax expense (approximately       $3million after tax) over the next four years.
Ball       adopted a deposit share program in March2001 that, by matching purchased       shares with restricted shares, encourages certain senior management employees       and outside directors to invest in Ball stock. In general, restrictions on       the       matching shares lapse at the end of four years from date of grant, or earlier       if       established share ownership guidelines are met, assuming the qualifying       purchased shares are not sold or transferred prior to that time. This plan       is       currently accounted for as a variable plan where compensation expense is       recorded based upon the current market price of the companys common stock until       restrictions lapse. The company recorded $7.3million, $17.5million       and $10.5million of expense in connection with this program in 2005, 2004       and 2003, respectively. The variances in expense recorded are the result of       the       timing and vesting of the share grants, as well as the higher price of Ball       stock. The deposit share program was amended and restated in April2004 and       further awards have been made.
Prior       to       passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act), Ball guaranteed loans       made       by a third party bank to certain participants in the deposit share program,       of       which $1.6million remained outstanding at December31, 2005. In the       event of a participant default, Ball would pursue payment from the participant.       The Act provides that companies may no longer guarantee such loans for its       executive officers. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the company       has not and will not guarantee any additional loans to its executive       officers.

Shareholders Equity (continued) These       options cannot be traded in any equity market. However, based on the       Black-Scholes option pricing model, adapted for use in valuing compensatory       stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123, options granted in 2005, 2004       and       2003 have estimated weighted average fair values at the date of grant of $11.65       per share, $10.24per share and $8.63 per share, respectively. The actual       value an employee may realize will depend on the excess of the stock price       over       the exercise price on the date the option is exercised. Consequently, there       is       no assurance that the value realized by an employee will be at or near the       value       estimated. The fair values were estimated using the following weighted average       assumptions: 2005                 Grants 2004                 Grants 2003                 Grants Expected                 dividend yield 1.01 % 1.17 % 0.84 % Expected                 stock price volatility 30.09 % 32.78 % 35.38 % Risk-free                 interest rate 3.89 % 3.45 % 2.87 % Expected                 life of options 4.75 years 4.75 years 4.75 years Through       December31, 2005, Ball has accounted for its stock-based employee       compensation programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion       No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. If we had elected to       recognize compensation in accordance with SFASNo.123, pro forma net       earnings and earnings per share would have been: Years                 ended December 31, ($                 in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 2003 Stock-based                 compensation as reported, net of tax $ 6.6 $ 12.5 $ 7.6 Pro                 forma effect of fair value based method 2.1 (3.2 ) 1.2 Pro                 forma stock-based compensation $ 8.7 $ 9.3 $ 8.8 Net                 earnings as reported $ 261.5 $ 295.6 $ 229.9 Pro                 forma effect of fair value based method (2.1 ) 3.2 (1.2 ) Pro                 forma net earnings $ 259.4 $ 298.8 $ 228.7 Basic                 earnings per share as reported $ 2.43 $ 2.67 $ 2.06 (a) Pro                 forma basic earnings per share 2.41 2.70 2.05 (a) Diluted                 earnings per share as reported $ 2.38 $ 2.60 $ 2.01 (a) Pro                 forma diluted earnings per share 2.36 2.63 2.00 (a) (a) Per                 share amounts have been retroactively restated for the two-for-one                 stock                 split effected August23,                 2004.
Effective       January1, 2006, Ball adopted SFASNo.123 (revised 2004), Share       Based Payment, which is a revision of SFASNo.123 and supersedes       APBOpinionNo.25. The new standard establishes accounting       standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments       for goods or services, including stock option and restricted stock grants.       On       March29, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff       Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.107, which summarizes the views of the SEC       staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) and certain       SEC rules and regulations and provides the SEC staffs views regarding the       valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. The major       differences for Ball in 2006 and future years includes (1)the fact that       there will be expense recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for       the       fair value of option grants and (2)the deposit share program will no       longer be a variable plan that is marked to current market value each month       (the       original fair value at date of grant will be used to determine the expense).       Upon adoption, Ball has chosen to use the modified prospective transition method       and, at least initially, the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Earnings Per Share The       following table provides additional information on the computation of earnings       per share amounts. Share and per share information have been retroactively       restated for the two-for-one stock splits discussed in Note 14.

A       total       of 709,250 options at an exercise price of $39.74and 639,400 options at an       exercise price of $28.155 were excluded for the years ended December31,       2005 and 2003, respectively. There were no anti-dilutive options for the year       ended December31, 2004.
16.       Financial Instruments and Risk Management Policies       and Procedures In       the       ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies       and       procedures to reduce our exposure to commodity price changes, changes in       interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currencies and fluctuations in prices       of       the companys common stock in regard to common share repurchases. Although the       instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest       risk, the counterparties are expected to perform fully under the terms of the       agreements.
Commodity       Price Risk We       manage       our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price       fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts,       which include aluminum-based pricing terms that consider price fluctuations       under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases. The terms include       a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing. This matched       pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage container net sales.       We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward       contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where       there       is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract.
North       American plastic container sales contracts include provisions to pass through       resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal, if any, exposure       related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most North American food       container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass       through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually       negotiated steel costs. In 2005 and 2004, we were able to pass through to our       customers the majority of steel surcharges.
Page           70 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 16.       Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued) In       Europe       and Asia, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw commodity price risks       through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as       well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the companys exposure to       fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and       sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass through pricing       arrangements. The company additionally uses forward and option contracts as       cash       flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures       for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to       minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes.
At       December31, 2005, the company had aluminum forward contracts with notional       amounts of $406.1million hedging its aluminum exposure. Cash flow and fair       value hedges related to forecasted transactions and firm commitments expire       within the next three years.
Included       in shareholders equity at December31, 2005, within accumulated other       comprehensive loss, is a net loss of $5.5million associated with these       contracts, of which a net loss of $19.8million is expected to be       recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during 2006. All of the       loss on these derivative contracts will be offset by higher revenue from sales       contracts. The consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2005, includes       $36.6million in prepaid expenses and $72.9million in other current       liabilities related to unrealized gains/losses on unsettled derivative       contracts. At December31, 2004, the company had aluminum forward and       option contracts with notional amounts of $303.4million hedging its       aluminum exposure.
Interest       Rate Risk Our       objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the       impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our       overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of       interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and       fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at       December31, 2005, included pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps.       Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate       instruments. Swap agreements expire at various times up to 11years.
At       December31, 2005, the company had outstanding interest rate swap       agreements in Europe of 50million paying fixed rates. Approximately 0.1million of net loss associated with these contracts is included in       accumulated other comprehensive loss at December31, 2005. The amount       expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during       the       next 12months is insignificant. In conjunction with the debt refinancing       and the retirement of the senior notes during the fourth quarter of 2005 (see       Note11), the company recognized approximately $1million of net gain       related to the termination or deselection of hedges that had been included       in       accumulated other comprehensive loss. At December31, 2004, the company had       interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $220million paying       floating rates and $120million paying fixed rates, or a net floating       position of $100million. In addition, at December31, 2004, the       company had an interest rate cap on Eurolibor interest rates with a notional       amount of 50million, the fair value of which was       insignificant.
The       fair       value of all non-derivative financial instruments approximates their carrying       amounts with the exception of long-term debt. Rates currently available to       the       company for loans with similar terms and maturities are used to estimate the       fair value of long-term debt based on discounted cash flows. The fair value       of       derivatives generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or       receive upon termination of the contracts at December31, 2005, taking into       account any unrealized gains and losses on open contracts.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued) Foreign       Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our       objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect       foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate       changes through the use of cash flow hedges. In addition, we manage foreign       earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options.       Our       foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound,       Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Brazilian real and Chinese       renminbi. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of       purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other       currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost       changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement,       the       company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures.       Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, expire within the next three years       and there are no amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss       related to these contracts.
17.         Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited) The         companys fiscal years end on December31 and the fiscal quarters generally         end on the Sunday nearest the calendar quarter end.
2005         Quarterly Information The         second quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $8.8million for the         closure of a three-piece food can manufacturing plant in Quebec, Canada.         The         third quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of $19.3million related to         the commencement of a project to upgrade and streamline its North American         beverage can end manufacturing capabilities. Included in the fourth quarter         of         2005 was a pretax charge of $4.6million for costs associated with a         reduction in the work force in a metal food container plant in Ontario, Canada,         which was partially offset by a $2.2million gain to adjust the net         realizable value of the Quebec plant closed in the second quarter of 2005.         Also         included in the third and fourth quarters were $1.3million and         $18million of debt refinancing charges related to the refinancing of         Balls senior secured credit facilities and redemption of the companys senior         notes due August2006. Other than these items, fluctuations in sales and         earnings for the quarters in 2005 reflected the number of days in each fiscal         quarter, as well as the normal seasonality of the business.
2004         Quarterly Information The         third         and fourth quarters of 2004 included earnings of $6.7million and         $8.5million, respectively, related to business consolidation activities         for which proceeds on assets were higher than originally estimated and costs         of         completion were less than anticipated. The fourth quarter also included a         $15.2million loss pertaining to an allowance for doubtful accounts related         to a minority-owned PRC joint venture.

Notes         to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball         Corporation and Subsidiaries 18.         Research and Development Research         and development costs are expensed as incurred in connection with the companys         internal programs for the development of products and processes. Costs incurred         in connection with these programs, the majority of which are included in         cost of         sales, amounted to $24.6million, $25.5million and $20.5million         for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,         respectively.
19.         Subsidiary Guarantees of Debt As         discussed in Note11, the companys notes payable and senior credit         facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several         basis         by certain of the companys domestic wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain foreign         denominated tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed         by         certain of the companys wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The senior credit         facilities are secured by: (1) a pledge of 100percent of the stock owned         by the company in its material direct and indirect majority-owned domestic         subsidiaries and (2) a pledge of the companys stock, owned directly or         indirectly, of certain foreign subsidiaries, which equals 65percent of the         stock of each such foreign subsidiary. The following is condensed, consolidating         financial information for the company, segregating the guarantor subsidiaries         and non-guarantor subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for         the         years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in millions of dollars).         Separate financial statements for the guarantor subsidiaries and the         non-guarantor subsidiaries are not presented because management has determined         that such financial statements would not be material to         investors.

20.       Subsequent Event On       February14, 2006, the company entered into a definitive merger agreement       in which Ball will acquire U.S. Can Corporations (U.S. Can) U.S. and       Argentinean operations for 1.1million sharesof Ball common stock and       the assumption of $550million of U.S. Cans debt. The transaction is       expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2006. U.S. Can is the largest       manufacturer of aerosol cans in the U.S. and also manufactures paint cans,       plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in 10plants in the U.S.       Aerosol cans are also produced in the two manufacturing plants in Argentina.       U.S. Cans U.S. and Argentinean operations had sales of approximately       $600million (unaudited) in 2005. Upon closing the acquisition of U.S. Can,       the company intends to refinance $550million of existing U.S. Can debt at       significantly lower interest rates. The refinancing will be completed with       Balls issuance of a new series of senior notes and an increase in bank debt       under the new senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of       2005.
21.       Contingencies The       company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course       of       business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which       we       participate, our operations in developing markets, changing commodity prices       for       the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital       markets. Where practicable, we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties       through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures, including,       at times, the use of certain derivative financial instruments.
From       time       to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business.       Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball       as a       potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the       cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does       not       indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the       liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the       company.
Due       to       political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no nationwide system for returning       beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed       in       January 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in       non-refillable containers. During 2003 and 2004, we responded to the resulting       lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our German plants,       implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from       Germany to other countries in the region served by Ball Packaging Europe. We       also closed a plant in the United Kingdom, shut down a production line in       Germany, delayed capital investment projects in France and Poland and converted       one of our steel can production lines in Germany to aluminum in order to       facilitate additional can exports from Germany. In 2004 the German       parliament adopted a new packaging ordinance, imposing a 25 eurocent deposit       on       all one-way glass, PET and metal containers for water, beer and carbonated       soft       drinks. As of May 1, 2006, all retailers must redeem all returned one-way       containers as long as they sell such containers. Major retailers in Germany       have       begun the process of implementing a returnable system for one-way containers       since they, along with fillers, now appear to accept the deposit as permanent.       The retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee       to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have begun       to       order reverse vending machines in order to meet the May 1, 2006,       deadline.
Page           81 of           97 Notes       to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball       Corporation and Subsidiaries 22.       Indemnifications and Guarantees During       the normal course of business, the company or the appropriate consolidated       direct or indirect subsidiaries have made certain indemnities, commitments       and       guarantees under which the specified entity may be required to make payments       in       relation to certain transactions. These indemnities, commitments and guarantees       include indemnities to the customers of the subsidiaries in connection with       the       sales of their packaging and aerospace products and services, guarantees to       suppliers of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company guaranteeing the       performance of the respective entity under a purchase agreement, indemnities       for       liabilities associated with the infringement of third party patents, trademarks       or copyrights under various types of agreements, indemnities to various lessors       in connection with facility, equipment, furniture, and other personal property       leases for certain claims arising from such leases, indemnities pursuant to       agreements relating to certain joint ventures, indemnities in connection with       the sale of businesses or substantially all of the assets and specified       liabilities of businesses, and indemnities to directors, officers and employees       of the company to the extent permitted under the laws of the State of Indiana       and the United States of America. The duration of these indemnities, commitments       and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. In addition, the       majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for       any       limitation on the maximum potential future payments the company could be       obligated to make. As such, the company is unable to reasonably estimate its       potential exposure under these items. The company has not recorded any liability       for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying       consolidated balance sheets. The company does, however, accrue for payments       under promissory notes and other evidences of incurred indebtedness and for       losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from       indemnifications, commitments and guarantees, when future payment is both       reasonably determinable and probable. Finally, the company carries specific       and       general liability insurance policies and has obtained indemnities, commitments       and guarantees from third party purchasers, sellers and other contracting       parties, which the company believes would, in many circumstances, provide       recourse to any claims arising from these indemnifications, commitments and       guarantees.
The       companys senior notes and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full,       unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the companys wholly       owned domestic subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior       credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the companys wholly       owned foreign subsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support of the       notes and credit facilities referred to above, are co-terminous with the terms       of the respective note indentures and credit agreement and would require       performance upon certain events of default referred to in the respective       guarantees. The maximum potential amounts which could be required to be paid       under the guarantees are essentially equal to the then outstanding principal       and       interest under the respective notes and credit agreement, or under the       applicable tranche. The company is not in default under the above notes or       credit facilities.
Ball       Capital Corp. II is a separate, wholly owned corporate entity created for the       purchase of receivables from certain of the companys wholly owned subsidiaries.       Ball Capital Corp. IIs assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy       the claims of its creditors. The company has provided an undertaking to Ball       Capital Corp. II in support of the sale of receivables to a commercial lender       or       lenders which would require performance upon certain events of default referred       to in the undertaking. The maximum potential amount which could be paid is       equal       to the outstanding amounts due under the accounts receivable financing (see       Note5). The company, the appropriate subsidiaries and Ball Capital Corp.       II are not in default under the above credit arrangement.
From       time       to time, the company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of       business. In the opinion of management, no such matter, individually or in       the       aggregate, exists which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the       companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash       flows.

Changes       in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial       Disclosure There       were no matters required to be reported under this item.
Item       9A.
Controls       and Procedures Evaluation       of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We       have       established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material       information relating to the company, including its consolidated subsidiaries,       is       made known to the officers who certify the companys financial reports and to       other members of senior management and the board of directors.
Based       on       their evaluation as of December31, 2005, the chief executive officer and       chief financial officer of the company have concluded that the companys       disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)       under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the       information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it       files       or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,       summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and       forms.
Managements       Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our       management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal       control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act       Rule13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our       management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,       we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over       financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated       Framework issued       by       the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based       on       our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting       was       effective as of December31, 2005. Our managements assessment of the       effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of       December31, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an       independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which       is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary       Data.
Changes       in Internal Control The       company is in the process of migrating the North American metal beverage       manufacturing and inventory system from a legacy system to a fully integrated       business system (the new system). To date, we have converted four metal beverage       plants to the new system and the migrations will continue into 2006 and 2007.       The migration involved changes in systems that included internal controls.       We       have reviewed the new system and the controls affected by the implementation       of       the new system and made appropriate changes to affected internal controls.       The       controls as modified are appropriate and operating effectively. There were       no       other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year       ended December31, 2005, that have materially affected, or are reasonably       likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial       reporting.

Westerlund 19,500 2.74 % 39.74 April                 27, 2015 $ 227,175 (1) Stock                 options were granted on April27, 2005, and were exercisable                 beginning one year after the grant and each year thereafter in                 25percent increments. Effective October26, 2005, the options                 became fully exercisable as a result of an acceleration of                 vesting.
(2) Stock                 options with an expiration date of April27, 2015, have an estimated                 value, at date of grant, of $11.65 per share based on the Black-Scholes                 option-pricing model adapted for use in valuing employee stock options.                 The estimated values under the Black-Scholes model are based on weighted                 average assumptions of volatility of 30.09percent, a risk-free rate                 of return of 3.89percent, a dividend yield of 1.01percent, an                 expected option term of 4.75years, and no adjustment for the risk of                 forfeiture. The actual value, if any, an executive may realize will                 depend                 on the excess of the stock price over the exercise price on the date                 the                 option is exercised. Consequently, there is no assurance the value                 realized by an executive will be at or near the value estimated by                 the                 Black-Scholes model.

Awards are expressed as a percentage                 of                 average annual salary and bonus at target during the performance period.                 However, Named Executive Officers whose Ball Corporation stock holdings                 are below the established guidelines will receive up to one-half                 of their                 award in Ball Corporation Restricted                 Stock.
(2) Estimated                 future payouts (earned awards) are based on Ball Corporations total                 shareholder return performance; i.e., stock price appreciation plus                 dividends, over three-year performance cycles which begin at the                 start of                 each calendar year, relative to the total shareholder return of companies                 listed on the S&P Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)                 which has replaced the S&P Industrials                 index.
(3) Mr.Fiedler                 retired at the end of 2005. Estimated future payouts for the performance                 period are prorated based on his service through                 2005.
Retirement       Plans The       following table, for purposes of illustration, indicates the amounts of annual       retirement income which would be payable in 2006 to the Named Executive       Officers, except Mr.Fiedler, at normal retirement age 65. The calculation       of retirement benefits under the plans generally is based upon average earnings       (base salary only) for the highest five consecutive years of the ten years       preceding retirement.
PENSION       PLAN TABLE Years                 of Service Average                 Annual Earnings 15 20 25 30 35 $ 250,000 $ 52,598 $ 70,130 $ 87,663 $ 105,196 $ 122,728 300,000 63,848 85,130 106,413 127,696 148,978 350,000 75,098 100,130 125,163 150,196 175,228 400,000 86,348 115,130 143,913 172,696 201,478 450,000 97,598 130,130 162,663 195,196 227,728 500,000 108,848 145,130 181,413 217,696 253,978 550,000 120,098 160,130 200,163 240,196 280,228 600,000 131,348 175,130 218,913 262,696 306,478 650,000 142,598 190,130 237,663 285,196 332,728 700,000 153,848 205,130 256,413 307,696 358,978 750,000 165,098 220,130 275,163 330,196 385,228 800,000 176,348 235,130 293,913 352,696 411,478 The       corporations qualified United States salaried       retirement plans provide defined benefits determined by base salary and years       of       service. The corporation has also adopted a nonqualified Supplemental Executive       Retirement Plan that provides benefits otherwise not payable under the qualified       pension plan to the extent that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended       (the Code), limits the pension to which an executive would be entitled under       the qualified pension plan. The benefit amounts shown in the preceding table       reflect the amount payable as a straight life annuity and include amounts       payable under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. On November30,       2003, the corporation terminated the Split-Dollar Life Insurance Plan that       provided a portion of the nonqualified       pension benefit. Mr.Seabrook elected a cash distribution from this plan       that will reduce his retirement benefit.
Page             87 of             97 Average       annual earnings used under the pension formula to calculate benefits together       with years of benefit service, as of December31, 2005, for the Named       Executive Officers are: R.David Hoover, $777,421(35.54years);       JohnR. Friedery, $312,500(17.33years); RaymondJ.       Seabrook, $327,200(13.21years); and DavidA. Westerlund,       $289,800(30.32years) offset by benefits received from a prior       employer.
Mr.Fiedlers       retirement income benefits are provided by a pension agreement that is part       of       his employment agreement. The agreement provides a benefit of 60percent of       his last gross base salary provided he is employed on the earlier of       December31, 2005, or reaches age 60and retires in good standing from       the corporation. Mr.Fiedler retired as an employee of the corporation at       the end of 2005 and his retirement benefit is 300,000per year based on       his 2005 salary of 500,000.
Termination       of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements The       corporation maintains revocable, funded grantor trusts, which, in the event       a       change in control of the corporation occurs, would become irrevocable with       funds       thereunder to be available to apply to the corporations obligations under its       deferred compensation plans covering key employees, including the Named       Executive Officers, except Mr.Fiedler. Under the trusts, a change in       control can occur by virtue, in general terms, of an acquisition by any person       of 40percent or more of the corporations voting shares; a merger in which       shareholders of the corporation before the merger own less than 60percent       of the corporations common stock after the merger; shareholder approval of a       plan to sell or dispose of substantially all of the assets of the corporation;       a       change of a majority of the corporations board within a 12-month period unless       approved by two-thirds of the directors in office at the beginning of such       period; a threatened change in control deemed to exist if there is an agreement       which would       result in a change in control or public announcement of intentions to cause       a       change in control; and by the adoption by the board of a resolution to the       effect that a change or threatened change in control has occurred for purposes       of the trusts. For amounts deferred on or after January1, 2005, the       definition of change in control has the meaning set forth in Section409A       of the Code, or any Treasury Department regulations or guidance. The trusts       were       funded as of December31, 2005, with approximately $57.0million of       net equity of corporate-owned life insurance policies on the lives of various       employees, including participants in the plans, and 1,037,890shares of the       corporations common stock and cash equivalents valued at $41.3million       ($39.72per share) at the close of business on December31, 2005, to       support approximately $171.6million of current deferred compensation       account balances of the beneficiaries of the trusts in the event of a change       in       control. The corporation has borrowing capacity to fully fund the trusts in       advance of a change in control and is required to do so prior to a change in       control. If the funds set aside in the trusts would be insufficient to pay       amounts due the beneficiaries, then the corporation would remain obligated       to       pay those amounts. In the event of the insolvency of the corporation, the funds       in the trusts would be available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of       the       corporation. The trusts were not established in response to any effort to       acquire control of the corporation, and the board is not aware of any such       effort.
The         corporation intends to establish separate revocable, funded grantor trusts         in         2006 which adopt the definition of change in control as set forth in the         Treasury Departments guidance and any regulations issued under         Section409A of the Code.
The         corporation has change-in-control severance agreements with certain key         employees, including the Named Executive Officers, except Mr.Fiedler. The         agreements are effective on a year-to-year basis and would provide severance         benefits in the event of both a change in control of the corporation and         an         actual or constructive termination of employment within two years after a         change         in control. Under the agreements, a change in control can occur by virtue, in         general terms, of an acquisition by any person of 30percent or more of the         corporations voting shares; a merger in which the shareholders of the         corporation before the merger own 50percent or less of the corporations         voting shares after the merger; shareholder approval of a plan of liquidation         or         a plan to sell or dispose of substantially all of the assets of the corporation;         and if, during any two-year period, directors at the beginning of the period         fail to constitute a majority of the board. Actual termination is any         termination other than by death or disability, by the corporation for cause,         or         by the executive, other than for constructive termination. Constructive         termination means, in general terms, any significant reduction in duties,         compensation or benefits or change of office location from those in effect         immediately prior to the change in control, unless agreed to by the executive.         The severance benefits payable, in addition to base salary and incentive         compensation accrued through Page               88 of               97 the         date         of termination, shall include two times current annual base salary and target         incentive compensation; the bargain element value of then-outstanding stock         options; the present value of the amount by which pension payments would         have         been larger had the executive accumulated two additional years of benefit         service; two years of life, disability, accident and health benefits;         outplacement services; and legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred in         enforcing the agreements. In the event such benefits, together with other         benefits paid because of a change in control, would be subject to the excise         tax         imposed under Section280G of the Code, the corporation would reimburse the         executive for such excise taxes paid, together with taxes incurred as a result         of such reimbursement. The agreements were not entered into in response to         any         effort to acquire control of the corporation, and the board is not aware         of any         such effort.
The       corporation has severance benefit agreements with certain key employees,       including the Named Executive Officers, except Mr.Fiedler. The agreements       provide severance benefits in the event of an actual or constructive termination       of employment. Actual termination is any termination other than by death or       disability, by the corporation for cause, or by the executive, other than for       constructive termination. Constructive termination means, in general terms,       any significant reduction in compensation or benefits, unless agreed to by       the       executive. The severance benefits payable, in addition to base salary and       incentive compensation accrued through the date of termination, include two       times current annual salary and target incentive compensation for       Mr.Hoover and one and one-half times current annual salary and target       incentive compensation for Messrs.Friedery, Seabrook and Westerlund; the       present value of the amount by which pension payments would have been larger       had       the executive accumulated two additional years of benefit service for       Mr.Hoover and one and one-half years of benefit service for       Messrs.Friedery, Seabrook and Westerlund; two years of life, disability,       accident and health benefits for Mr.Hoover and one and one-half years of       life, disability, accident and health benefits for Messrs.Friedery,       Seabrook and Westerlund; outplacement services; and legal fees and expenses       reasonably incurred in enforcing the agreements.
Upon       the       occurrence of a change in control as defined in the change-in-control severance       agreements, the executive is entitled to the greater of each of the benefits       provided in this agreement and each of the benefits provided in the       change-in-control severance agreement, including reimbursement for excise taxes       which may be incurred as a result of such payments.
The         corporation entered into an employment agreement with Mr.Fiedler         negotiated in connection with the acquisition of Schmalbach-Lubeca AG and         effective from December19, 2002, through December31, 2005. That         agreement has expired and Mr.Fiedler retired as an employee of the         corporation at the end of 2005.
Directors         Compensation Directors         who are not employees of the corporation receive as compensation a total         target         annual retainer composed of a $30,000annual fixed retainer, plus an annual         incentive retainer based upon the corporations actual operating performance for         each fiscal (calendar) year. The annual incentive retainer is calculated         in         accordance with the corporations performance-based incentive compensation plan         at a rate of 50percent of the directors annual fixed retainer. Both         annual retainers are paid 50percent in cash and 50percent in         restricted stock. The restrictions on the stock will lapse upon the director         ceasing to serve as a director for any reason other than voluntary resignation,         in which case the restrictions will not lapse and the director will forfeit         the         shares. For federal income tax purposes, the value of the shares will be         taxable         to the recipient as compensation income in an amount equal to the fair market         value of the corporations common stock on the date the restrictions lapse.         There has been no retirement plan for directors since 1997.
Nonemployee         directors also receive a fee of $1,500for attending each board meeting, a         fee of $1,250for attending one or more committee meetings held on any one         day and a fee of $1,250per quarter for serving as a chair of a board         committee and a per diem allowance of $750for special assignments.         Directors who are also employees of the corporation receive no additional         compensation for their service on the board or on any board committee.         Nonemployee directors may elect to defer the payment of a portion or all         of         their directors fees or retainers into the 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for         Directors or a portion or all of their directors annual incentive retainer into         the 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan. These plans replace the         directors prior deferred compensation plans for fees and retainers earned prior         to 2005. Amounts deferred or transferred into the 2005 Deferred Compensation         Company Stock Plan receive a 20percent company match with a maximum match         of $20,000per year. Amounts deferred, transferred or credited to this plan         will be represented in the participants account as stock units, with each unit         having the value equivalent to one share of Ball Corporation common stock.         All         distributions of accounts will be made in the form of Ball common stock         following termination of each directors service. Amounts deferred to the 2005 Page89           of 97 Deferred       Compensation Plan for Directors are invested among various investment funds       available under the Plan. A participants amounts are not actually       invested in the investment funds for the account, but the return on a       participants account is determined as if the amounts were notionally invested       in those funds.
Each       nonemployee director will receive a 4,000-share restricted stock award upon       reelection for a three-year term. Each newly eligible nonemployee director       will       receive a 4,000-share restricted stock award upon election or appointment for       an       initial term (except initial terms of less than one year), and upon reelection       for a three-year term. The restrictions against disposal of the stock will       lapse       upon the termination of the directors service to the corporation as a director,       for whatever reason other than voluntary resignation during a term, in which       case the restrictions will not lapse and the director will forfeit the shares.       For federal income tax purposes, the value of the stock will be taxable to       the       director as compensation income in an amount equal to the fair market value       of       the common stock on the date the restrictions lapse. Messrs.Smart, Solso       and Taylor each received a 4,000-share restricted stock award upon reelection       as       directors on April27, 2005, under the terms of the 2005 Stock and Cash       Incentive Plan. The corporation has established a 10,000 share stock ownership       guideline for each non-management director.
In         2001         the corporation implemented a Deposit Share Program for its nonemployee         directors. The program is intended to increase share ownership by directors         who         must make additional investments in the corporations common stock to         participate in the program. Under this program, each director receives one         share         of restricted stock for every share acquired by the director. Restricted         stock         is granted pursuant to the shareholder approved Ball Corporation 2005 Stock         and         Cash Incentive Plan or its successor. Under the terms of the Deposit Share         Program for Directors, which was amended and restated in April 2004, future         awards have share acquisition periods and restricted stock lapse provisions         established at the time of the award. On January26, 2005, Mr.Smart         was granted the opportunity to participate in the program up to a maximum         of         6,000 shares that must be acquired during a two-year period beginning on         the         grant date. No other deposit share grants were made to nonemployee directors         pursuant to the Amended and Restated Deposit Share Program during         2005.
