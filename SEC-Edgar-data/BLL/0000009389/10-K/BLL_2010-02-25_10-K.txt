Exhibits,       Financial Statement Schedules 90 Signatures 91 Index       to Exhibits 93 PART I Item 1.Business Ball Corporation (Ball, we, the company or our) is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured inplants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers within our aerospace and technologies segment (Ball Aerospace). In 2008 our total consolidated net sales were $7.6billion. Our packaging businesses are responsible for 90 percent of that number, with the remaining 10 percent contributed from our aerospace business.
Our largest product lines are aluminum and steel beverage cans, which contributed 65percent of our 2008 total net sales and 75percent of our 2008 total segment earnings before interest and taxes. We also produce steel food cans, steel aerosol cans, polyethylene terepthalate (PET) and polypropylene plastic bottles for beverages and foods, plastic pails, steel paint cans and decorative steel tins. Our ongoing packaging business dates back to 1969 when Ball began supplying beverage cans.
We sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the People  s Republic of China (PRC) and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in Brazil, the U.S. and the PRC.
Ball Aerospace is a leader in the design, development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems. It produces spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency and microwave technologies, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions. Our packaging and aerospace businesses share a long history and a common financial philosophy, and we benefit from the presence of each.
Our corporate strategy is to grow our worldwide beverage can business and our aerospace business, to improve the performance of the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, and plastic packaging, Americas, segments and to utilize free cash flow and earnings growth to increase shareholder value.
We are headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, and employ approximately 14,500people worldwide. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BLL. Our predecessor company was founded in 1880 by five Ball brothers and operated for many years as Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company.
Our Financial Strategy Ball Corporation maintains a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through:  Focusing       on free cash flow generation  Increasing       Economic Value Added (EVA)  Delivering       long-term earnings per share growth of 10percent to 15 percent over       time The cash generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1) to finance the company's operations, (2) to fund stock buy-back programs and dividend payments, (3) to fund strategic investments and (4) to service the company'sdebt. We also will, when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders, make strategic acquisitions or divest parts of our business.
The compensation of a majority of our employees is tied directly to the companys performance through our EVA incentive program. When the company performs well, our employees are paid more. If the company does not perform well, our employees get paid less or no incentive compensation.
Page 1 of 96 Our Reporting Segments Ball Corporation reports its financial performance in five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines, after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics: (1)metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia; (2)metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3)metal food and household products packaging, Americas; (4)plastic packaging, Americas; and (5)aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Due to first quarter 2008 management reporting changes, Balls operations in the PRC with 2008 net sales of $289.6million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment (previously included within the companys European operations). Prior periods required to be shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) have been conformed to the current presentation.
Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, production volumes, labor, transportation, utility and warehousing costs, as well as the availability and price of raw materials, such as aluminum sheet, tinplate steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. These raw materials are generally available from several sources, and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages. There has been significant consolidation of suppliers in both North America and in Europe. Raw materials and energy sources, such as natural gas and electricity, may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors, and the pass through of steel and aluminum costs to our customers may be limited in some instances. We cannot predict the timing or effects, if any, of such occurrences on future operations.
A substantial part of Balls packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses, including SABMiller plc and bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Additional details about sales to major customers are included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, which can be found in Item 8 of this Annual Report (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).
Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia, Segment Industry Background and Balls Operations According to publicly available information and company estimates, the combined U.S. and Canada metal beverage container markets decreased in 2008 to 101billion units from 105billion units in 2007. Five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the U.S. and Canada. Two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in Mexico. Ball produced in excess of 30billion recyclable beverage cans in the U.S. and Canada in 2008  about 30percent of the total market. Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September. All of the beverage cans produced by Ball in the U.S. and Canada are made of aluminum, as are all beverage cans produced by our competitors in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In 2008 we were able to pass through substantially all aluminum-related cost increases levied by producers. In North America, four aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements. Some of those aluminum suppliers have experienced significant financial and liquidity constraints in recent years, which may be exacerbated by the global economic crisis.
We believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum sheet as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes, as well as the use of derivative instruments.
Beverage containers are sold in a highly competitive market based on quality, service and price, which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by plants that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably. In addition the aluminum beverage can competes aggressively with other packaging materials. The glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water industries over the past quarter century. In Canada, metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of packaged beverage industry volumes than in the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer industry.
Page 2 of 96 Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, is Balls largest segment, accounting for 40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008. Metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages. Decorated two-piece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 14 manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and one in Canada. Can ends are produced within two of the U.S. facilities, as well as in a third facility that manufactures only ends. Through Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC, a 50:50 joint venture, which is accounted for as an equity investment, Ball and MillerCoors, LLC, operate beverage can and end manufacturing facilities in Golden, Colorado. On July 1, 2008, the U.S. and Puerto Rico businesses of Coors Brewing Company (Coors) and our largest North American brewery customer, Miller Brewing Company (Miller), were combined to form MillerCoors, LLC.
The beverage can market in the PRC is approximately 12billion cans, of which Balls operations represent an estimated 22percent, with an additional 13percent manufactured by two joint ventures in which we participate. Our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of beverage cans in the PRC. Six other manufacturers make up the remainder of the market. Our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants in the PRC, as well as in our two joint ventures. We also manufacture and sell high-density plastic containers in two PRC plants primarily servicing the motor oil industry. Capacity grew rapidly in the PRC in the late 1990s, resulting in a supply/demand imbalance. A number of can makers, including Ball, responded by rationalizing capacity. Demand growth has resumed over the past several years, and we expect the PRC market to continue to grow over time, after the effects of the current global economic crisis begin to dissipate.
We participate in a 50:50 joint venture in Brazil, Latapack-Ball Embalagens, Ltda., that manufactures aluminum cans and ends and is accounted for as an equity investment. The Brazilian joint venture is expanding capacity at its existing facility near Sao Paulo and is building a new plant near Rio de Janeiro.
In order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business, during 2008 Ball announced or completed the closure of three metal beverage packaging plants in North America:  We       closed a metal beverage packaging plant in Kent, Washington. The plant had       two 12-ounce aluminum beverage can manufacturing lines that produced       approximately 1.1billion cans annually. The closure is expected to       result in net fixed costs savings of approximately $10 million in       2009.
We       announced on October 30, 2008, the closure of our metal beverage can       plants in Kansas City, Missouri, and Guayama, Puerto Rico. The Kansas City       plant, which primarily manufactures specialty beverage cans, will be       closed by the end of the first quarter 2009 with manufacturing volumes       absorbed by other North American beverage can plants. The Puerto Rico       facility, which manufactured 12-ounce beverage cans, was closed at the end       of 2008. Cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected       to be up to $30 million in 2009 and be $7 million cash positive upon final       disposition of the assets.
Where growth is projected in certain markets or for certain products, Ball is undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities and may establish or obtain additional manufacturing capacity to the extent required by the growth of any of the markets we serve.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe, Segment Industry Background and Balls Operations The European beverage can market is approximately 55 billion cans, or more than half the size of the North American beverage can market. While current economic conditions have slowed growth in the near term, the European market is expected to grow, and is highly regional in terms of growth and packaging mix. Growth in central and eastern Europe has been particularly strong in recent years but has been impacted by the recent economic downturn, causing the company to delay completion of its new plant in Lublin, Poland. Western markets, including the United Kingdom and France continue to hold up on a relative basis.
Page 3 of 96 Sales volumes of metal beverage containers in Europe tend to be highest during the period from May through August with a smaller increase in demand during the winter holiday season for the United Kingdom. As in North America, the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the European beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated soft drink, juice and mineral water industries.
Ball Packaging Europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in Europe, with an estimated 29percent of European shipments, and supplies two-piece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer, carbonated soft drinks, mineral water, fruit juices, energy drinks and other beverages.
The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment, which accounted for 25 percent of Balls consolidated net sales in 2008, consists of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in Europe. Of the 12European plants, four are located in Germany, three in the United Kingdom, two in France and one each in the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia. In addition Ball Packaging Europe is currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in Haslach, Germany in order to produce the Ball Resealable End (BRE). The European plants produced approximately 16billion cans in 2008, with approximately 56percent of those being produced from aluminum and 44 percent from steel. Six of the can plants use aluminum and four use steel.
Ball announced plans in January 2008 to build a new beverage can manufacturing plant in Poland in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for beverage cans there and elsewhere in central and eastern Europe. The plant is being built in Lublin, which is in eastern Poland near the borders of Belarus and Ukraine. It will initially have one production line with an annual capacity of approximately 750 million cans per year. However, due to the recent global economic downturn, we will delay the completion of the plant until market conditions warrant such startup. In addition we are delaying construction of our planned beverage can plant in India due to current economic conditions in that country.
European raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year, although Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer term agreements. In Europe three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95 percent of our requirements. Aluminum is purchased primarily in U.S. dollars, while the functional currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are non-U.S. dollars. The company generally tries to minimize the resulting foreign exchange rate risk through the use of derivative contracts. In addition purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing arrangements.
Metal Food & Household Products Packaging, Americas, Segment Industry Background and Balls Operations The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment competes primarily in the steel tinplate food and aerosol can markets in North America. The steel tinplate food can market consists of approximately 31 billion cans annually, of which about 43 percent are three-piece cans and 57 percent are two-piece cans. The steel tinplate aerosol can market is approximately 3.2 billion cans annually. We anticipate slight growth in the aerosol market, while the food market is expected to be essentially flat over time.
Sales volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be highest from May through October as a result of seasonal fruit, vegetable and salmon packs. We estimate our 2008 shipments of more than 5.6 billion steel food containers to be approximately 19 percent of total U.S. and Canadian metal food container shipments. We estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 50 percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel aerosol shipments.
Competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers. Several producers in Mexico also manufacture steel food containers. Competition in the U.S. steel aerosol can market primarily includes two national suppliers. Steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and the stand-up pouch. As a result, demand for this product line is dependent on product innovation and cost reduction. Service, quality and price are among the other key competitive factors. In North America, two steel suppliers provide more than 70percent of our tinplate steel. Some steel suppliers have experienced significant financial and liquidity constraints in recent years, which may be exacerbated by the global economic crisis. We believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate as a result of the inclusion of provisions in Page 4 of 96 certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs. In 2008 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers.
The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment accounted for 16percent of consolidated net sales in 2008. The two major product lines in this segment are steel food and aerosol containers. Ball produces two-piece and three-piece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood, nutritional products, pet food and other products. These containers and ends are manufactured in nine plants in the U.S. and Canada and sold primarily to food processors in North America.
The segment also manufactures and sells aerosol cans, paint cans and custom and specialty containers in eightplants in the U.S. and is the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in North America. In addition the company manufactures and sells aerosol cans in two plants in Argentina.
In October 2007, as part of a restructuring of Balls metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment, Ball announced plans to close aerosol container manufacturing plants in Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California. Ball closed the Commerce facility during the third quarter of 2008 and closed the Tallapoosa facility in January 2009. The two plant closures result in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10production lines, including the relocation of two high-speed aerosol lines into existing Ball facilities, and allow us to supply customers from a consolidated asset base. These actions are expected to yield annual pretax cost savings in excess of $15million in 2009 and improve aerosol plant manufacturing utilization to more than 85percent from about 70percent.
Also in October 2007, Ball announced its intention to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business based in its Baltimore, Maryland, manufacturing plant. During 2008 it was determined, based on market conditions that we would remain in that business.
Plastic Packaging, Americas, Segment Industry Background and Balls Operations Demand for containers made of PET and polypropylene has slowed in the beverage and food markets due to current economic conditions. While PET and polypropylene beverage containers compete against metal, glass and cardboard, the historical increase in the sales of PET containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions.
Competition in the PET plastic container industry is intense and includes several national and regional suppliers and self manufacturers. In the smaller polypropylene container industry, Ball is one of three major competitors. Service, quality and price are important competitive factors with price being by far the most important, resulting in poor margins for most of the industry. The ability to produce customized, differentiated plastic containers is also a key competitive factor. We believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of plastic resin as a result of the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes.
Plastic packaging, Americas, accounted for 9percent of Balls consolidated net sales in 2008. We estimate our 2008 shipments of 5.5billion plastic bottles to be approximately 10 percent of total U.S. PET container shipments. In addition this segment shipped approximately 750million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2008. The company operates eight plastic container manufacturing facilities in the U.S.
Most of Balls PET containers are sold under long-term contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks, including bottlers of Pepsi-Cola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Most of our polypropylene containers are also sold under long-term contracts, primarily to food packaging companies. Plastic beer containers are being produced for several of our customers, and we are manufacturing plastic containers for the single-serve juice and wine markets. Our line of Heat-Tek PET plastic bottles for hot-filled beverages, such as sports drinks and juices, includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces.
Page 5 of 96 Balls emphasis in this segment is on customized, differentiated containers. This includes unique barrier plastics such as Gamma, Gamma-Clear, AmazonHM and KHS Corpoplast GmbH Plasmax barrier bottles. The company is not investing in the carbonated soft drink and bottled water business, which is a commodity business, where return on investment has been unacceptable.
On June 26, 2008, Ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in Brampton, Ontario, which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2008. The Brampton operations have been consolidated into the companys other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the closure of this facility is expected to result in annual, fixed-cost savings of approximately $4 million beginning in 2009.
Aerospace and Technologies Segment Balls aerospace and technologies segment, which accounted for 10percent of consolidated net sales in 2008, includes national defense, antenna and video technologies, civil and operational space and systems engineering solutions businesses. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S. government agencies. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 91 percent of segment sales in 2008.
Geopolitical events, shifting executive and legislative branch priorities, funding shortfalls combined with increased competition for new business have resulted in a decline in opportunities in areas matching Balls aerospace and technologies segments core capabilities in space hardware. Although we have seen declines in our space hardware opportunities, our traditional strength, we have seen growth in opportunities related to our services and tactical components. The businesses include hardware, software and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space science and exploration, environmental and Earth sciences, and defense and intelligence applications. Major contractual activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations.
Other hardware activities include target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and sensor cooling devices using either closed-cycle mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle solid and liquid cryogens; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors. Additionally, the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare, electronic warfare, avionics, intelligence, training and space systems needs.
Backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was $597million and $774million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The 2008backlog includes $378million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2009, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders, which are subject to annual funding, were $309million and $463million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations.
On February15, 2008, the segment completed the sale of its shares in Ball Solutions Group Pty Ltd (BSG) to QinetiQ Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5 million, including cash sold of $1.8 million.BSG was previously a wholly owned Australian subsidiary that provided services to the Australian department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million.
Balls aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the U.S. government or its contractors that have standard termination provisions. The government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience. However, if contracts are terminated in this manner, Ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination. U.S. government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints.
Page 6 of 96 Patents In the opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole.
Research and Development Research and development (R&D) efforts in the North American packaging segments, as well as in the European metal beverage container business, are primarily directed toward packaging innovation, specifically the development of new sizes and types of containers, as well as new uses for the current containers. Other R&D efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies. Our North American packaging R&D activities are primarily conducted in the Ball Technology & Innovation Center (BTIC) located in Westminster, Colorado. The European R&D activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in Bonn, Germany.
In our aerospace business, we continue to focus our R&D activities on the design, development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems. This includes the production of spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency and microwave technologies, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions. Our aerospace R&D activities are conducted in various locations in the U.S.
Note23, "Research and Development," in the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report, contains information on company research and development activity. Additional information is also included in Item 2, Properties.
Sustainability and the Environment Throughout our companys history, we have focused on sustainability and the environment in all aspects of our businesses and recently have formalized our initiatives in light of the current environment. We continue to make progress on the sustainability goals stated in the sustainability report we issued on June 30, 2008. We have committed to formally report on the status of our sustainability efforts in 2010.
Key issues for our company include reducing our use of electricity and natural gas, reducing waste and increasing recycling at our facilities, analyzing and reducing our water consumption, reducing our existing volatile organic compounds and further improving safety performance in our facilities.
The 2007 recycling rate in the United States for aluminum cans was 54percent, the highest recycling rate for any beverage container. According to the most recently published data, the aluminum can sheet we buy contains an average of 41percent post consumer recycled content and approximately 9percent post industrial content, reducing the amount of virgin material to 50percent.
Recycling rates vary throughout Europe but average around 60percent for aluminum and steel containers, which exceeds the European Unions goal of 50 percent recycling for metals. Due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel, metal packaging recycling rates in Europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials. Balls European operations help establish and financially support recycling initiatives in growing markets, such as Poland and Serbia, to educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel cans and to increase recycling rates. We have also initiated a similar program in China to educate consumers in that market regarding the benefits of recycling.
Compliance with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the company. As more fully described under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. However, the companys information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
Page 7 of 96 Legislation that would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers, or would require diversion of solid wastes, including packaging materials, from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate. While container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future. If such legislation were widely adopted, it could potentially have a material adverse effect on the business of the company, including its liquidity, results of operations or financial condition, as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally, in view of the companys substantial global sales and investment in metal and PET container manufacturing. However, the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in U.S. states, Canadian provinces and European countries that have deposit systems.
Employee Relations At the end of 2008, the company employed approximately 10,400employees in the U.S. and 4,100in other countries. An additional 1,000people were employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which Ball participates.
Approximately 30 percent of Ball's North American packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our European plant employees are union workers. Collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the U.S. have terms of three to five years and those in Europe have terms of one to two years. The agreements expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company representatives. The company believes that its employee relations are good and that its safety, training, education and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels.

Page 8 of 96 Item 1A. Risk Factors Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its requirements, could have a significant negative impact on our sales.
While we have diversified our customer base, we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage, packaged food and household product companies, some of which operate in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.
Although approximately 65percent of our customer contracts are long-term, these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality or volume requirements. Because we depend on relatively few major customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers' employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers.
The primary customers for our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. These sales represented approximately 9percent of Ball's consolidated 2008 net sales. Our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks, including funding cuts and delays, technical uncertainties, budget changes, competitive activity and changes in scope.
We face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability.
Competition within the packaging industry is intense. Increases in productivity, combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price, service and quality. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours. The current global economic crisis may result in reductions in demand for our products, which, in turn, could increase these competitive pressures.
We are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows.
Our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET, single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials. Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the United States and the United Kingdom. Certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative solutions. There can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products, which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow.
We have a narrow product range, and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased.
For the 12months ended December 31, 2008, 65percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage cans. Our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to cans, or the demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Page 9 of 96 Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from increased international operations.
We derived 31percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the U.S. for the year ended December31, 2008. This sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are not limited to, the following:  political       and economic instability in foreign markets;  foreign       governments' restrictive trade policies;  the       imposition of duties, taxes or government   royalties;  foreign       exchange rate risks;  difficulties       in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property       rights; and  the       geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in       different areas of the world.
Any of these factors, some ofwhich are also present in the U.S.,could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
For the 12months ended December 31, 2008, 73percent of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations with the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, 15percent with the euro as the functional currency and 12percent were attributable to operations having functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar or the euro.
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Historically, Ball's foreign operations, including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, have been denominated in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated. As a result, the U.S. dollar value of Ball's foreign operations has varied, and will continue to vary, with exchange rate fluctuations. Ball has been, and is presently, primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Serbian dinar.
A decrease in the value of any of these currencies, especially the euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. In addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.
We actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and, as a result, we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. Our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results.
Our business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world.
We may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to lower prices, exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability.
If we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement our key objectives.
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our experienced management team. Losing the services of key members of our management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives.
Page 10 of 96 Decreases in our ability to apply new technology and know-how may affect our competitiveness.
Our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products, we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
Bad weather and climate changes may result in lower sales.
We manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods. Unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers. In addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers. The effects of global warming on climate could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world.
We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials.
We purchase aluminum, steel, plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments to manage our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices. Economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages. Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Because our North American contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer, increasing raw material costs may not impact our near-term profitability but could decrease our sales volumes over time. In Europe, some contracts do not allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly use derivative agreements to manage this risk. Our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase.
Prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position.
As of December 31, 2008, approximately 30 percent of our employees in North America and most of our employees in Europe were covered by one or more collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years. Although we consider our employee relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us. Potential legislation has been discussed in the United States, which may, if enacted, facilitate the ability of unions to unionize workers and to establish collective bargaining agreements with employers, including the company.
Our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business including those outlined below.
In our aerospace business, existing U.S. government contracts are subject to continued appropriations by Congress and may be terminated or delayed if future funding is not made available.
Our backlog includes both cost-type and fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of the work performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees.
Our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs.
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated us, along with numerous other Page 11 of 96 companies, as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. The new U.S. executive administration could bring renewed focus and attention to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues.
There can be no assurance that any acquired business, will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company.
While we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans, if we cannot successfully integrate newly acquired businesses with those of Ball, we may experience negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks, including difficulties in assimilating and integrating new businesses, additional demands on management, expenses related to undisclosed or potential liabilities, retention of major customers and other risks.
If we have a fair value impairment in a business segment, net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected by a write down of goodwill.
We have $1,825.5million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008.We are required to periodically determine if our goodwill has become impaired, in which case we would write down the impaired portion of goodwill. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected.
If the investments in Ball's pension plans do not perform as expected, we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses.
Ball maintainsdefined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its North American and United Kingdom employees, which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions. The plans  assets consist primarily of common stocks, fixed income securities and, in the U.S., alternative investments. Due to the significant fall in worldwide equity prices during 2008, the company will increase contributions to the plans during 2009. At this time the company estimates the additional U.S. pension plan contribution to be within the range of $35 million to $40 million pretax; however, we are monitoring legislative activity and equity markets to determine the final amount we will contribute to ensure that the plans will be able to pay out benefits as scheduled. Further equity market declines, longevity increases or legislative changes could result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings, and the recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders' equity.
Restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect o ur short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures.
On December 31, 2008, we had total debt of $2,410.1million and unused committed credit lines in excess of $500 million. Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date was 3.7 times (see Exhibit12 attached to this Annual Report). A reduction of financial liquidity could have important consequences, including the following:  reduce       our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and       development expenditures and other business   activities;  increase       our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,       including the credit risks stemming from the current global credit       crisis;  limit       our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses       and the industries in which we operate;  restrict       us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business       opportunities; and  limit,       along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt,       among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of       assets, pay cash dividends or refinance debt   maturities.
In addition approximately 60 percent of our debt bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. While we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.
Page 12 of 96 The current global credit, financial and economic crisis could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
The current global credit, financial and economic crisis could have significant negative effects on our operations, including, but not limited to, the following:  the       creditworthiness of customers, suppliers and counterparties could       deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of       raw materials;  the       recent downward trend of market performance could affect the fair value of       our pension assets, potentially requiring us to make significant       additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain       prescribed funding levels;  asignificant       weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in       noncompliance with our debt covenants; and  reduced       cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to       execute our long-term strategy to increase liquidity, reduce debt,       repurchase our stock and invest in our   businesses.
We are subject to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), under which we are often required to make changes in our accounting and reported results.
U.S. GAAP changes are routine and have become more frequent and significant over the past few years. These changes can have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods. In the application of U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingencies and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The proposed steps to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards in the U.S. could exacerbate these risks.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments There were no matters required to be reported under this item.
Item 2. Properties The companys properties described below are well maintained, are considered adequate and are being utilized for their intended purposes.
Balls corporate headquarters and the aerospace and technologies segment offices are located in Broomfield, Colorado. The Colorado-based operations of the aerospace and technologiessegment occupy a variety of company-owned and leased facilities in Broomfield, Boulder and Westminster, which together aggregate 1.3millionsquare feet of office, laboratory, research and development, engineering and test and manufacturing space. Other aerospace and technologies operations carry on business in smaller company-owned and leased facilities in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
The offices of the companys North American packaging operations are located in Westminster, Colorado, and the offices for the European packaging operations are located in Ratingen, Germany. Also located in Westminster is the Ball Technology and Innovation Center, which serves as a research and development facility for the North American metal packaging and plastic container operations. The European Technical Center, which serves as a research and development facility for the European beverage can manufacturing operations, is located in Bonn, Germany.
Information regarding the approximate size of the manufacturing locations for significant packaging operations, which are owned or leased by the company, is set forth below. Facilities in the process of being shut down have been excluded from the list. Where certain locations include multiple facilities, the total approximate size for the location is noted. In addition to the facilities listed, the company leases other warehousing space.

In addition to the consolidated manufacturing facilities, the company has ownership interests of 50percent or less in packaging affiliates located primarily in the U.S., PRC and Brazil, which affiliates own or lease manufacturing facilities in each of those countries.
Page 15 of 96 Item 3. Legal Proceedings As previously reported, the company is investigating potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Argentina, which came to our attention on or about October15, 2007. The Department of Justice and the SEC were also made aware of this matter, on or about the same date. Based on our investigation to date, we do not believe this matter involved senior management or management or other employees who have significant roles in internal control over financial reporting.
As previously reported, on October6, 2005, Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. (BMBCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, was served with an amended complaint filed by Crown Packaging Technology, Inc. et.al. (Crown), in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division at Dayton, Ohio. The complaint alleges that the manufacture, sale and use of certain ends by BMBCC and its customers infringes certain claims of Crowns U.S. patents. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief. BMBCC has formally denied the allegations of the complaint. A Markman order construing the claim terms has been issued in this case and motions for summary judgment have been filed by both parties. A trial has been tentatively set to begin in May 2009. Based on the information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
As previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers the company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On June12, 1992, the company was served with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contributions from the company and approximately 38other companies. The company filed its answer denying the allegations of the complaint. On July8, 1992, the company was served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company, Inc., seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the allegations of the complaints.
In July 1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (collectively Waste Management) and Denver pursuant to which Waste Management and Denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company, and Waste Management agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the site. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to guarantee the obligations for Waste Management. Waste Management and Denver may seek additional payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed $319million. In 2003 Waste Management, Inc., indicated that the cost of the site might exceed $319million in 2030, approximately three years before the projected completion of the project. The company might also be responsible for payments (based on 1992 dollars) for any additional wastes that may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified after the execution of the settlement agreement. While remediating the site, contaminants were encountered, which could add an additional cleanup cost of approximately $10million. This additional cleanup cost could, in turn, add approximately $1million to total site costs for the PRP group.
At this time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively involved. Based on the information available to the company at this time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
As previously reported, the USEPA has sent notice of potential liability to Ball and other PRPs with respect to four parcels at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site, and other adjacent sites, located in Jefferson County, Colorado, as well as with respect to the Solvents Recovery of New England site located in Southington, Connecticut. Based on the information available to the company at the present time, the company believes that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
On December30, 2002, the company received a letter from the USEPA pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste disposal practices of Heekin Can Company, which the company acquired in 1993, and the relationship between the company and Heekin Can Company. Region 5 of the USEPA is involved in the cleanup Page 16 of 96 of the Jackson Brothers Paint Company site, which consists of four, and possibly five, sites in and around Laurel, Indiana. The Jackson Brothers Paint Company apparently disposed of drums of waste in those sites during the 1960s and 1970s. The USEPA has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was sent to the sites from the Cincinnati plant operated by Heekin Can Company. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management referred this matter to the USEPA for removal of the drums and cleanup. At the present time, there are an undetermined number of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified by the USEPA as originating from Heekin Can Company. The USEPA has sent letters to seven PRPs including Heekin Can Company. On January30, 2003, the company responded to the USEPAs requests for information pursuant to Section104(e) of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs to be between $4million and $5million. Based on the information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

Page 19 of 96 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball or the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW Ball Corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage, food and household products industries. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured inplants around the world. We also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.
We sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage, food and household products companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in North America, Europe, the People  s Republic of China (PRC) and Argentina, as do our equity joint ventures in Brazil, the U.S. and the PRC. We also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers. Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contracts and long-term relationships help us to mitigate those risks in the majority of circumstances.
In the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products and expanding volume. Over the past two years, we have closed several packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand. We have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our worldwide beverage can business.
While the North American beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature, the European, PRC and Brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long-term. While we are able to capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our European can manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion, we have put on hold various projects, including the completion of the construction of the Poland plant and new construction in India, due to the current world-wide economic environment. We are proceeding with the recently announced new one-line metal beverage can plant in our Brazil joint venture and are adding further can capacity in the existing Brazilian can plant. These Brazilian expansion efforts will be owned by Balls unconsolidated 50-percent-owned joint venture, Latapack-Ball Embalagens, Ltda., and the expansion is being funded by cash flows from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture.
As part of our packaging strategy, we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer. These innovations include new shapes, sizes, opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging. This packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage, food and household products customers. As part of this focus, we installed a new aluminum bottle line, as well as a 24-ounce beverage can production line in our Monticello, Indiana, facility, both of which became operational during the third quarter of 2008.
Balls consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments, as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item 7A of this report.
Page 20 of 96 The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. It is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities, or changes in agency budgets, could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance. We expect that the delay of certain program awards, as well as federal budget considerations under the new administration, will have an unfavorable impact on this segment in 2009, and we are taking steps to adjust our resources accordingly.
We recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost-to-cost, percentage of completion method of accounting. Our present contract mix consists of approximately two-thirds percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, while the remainder arefixed-price contracts. We include time and material contracts in the fixed-price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates. Failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect segment performance during 2009 compared to 2008.
Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of BATCs total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. Because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.
Management uses various measures to evaluate company performance. The primary financial metric we use is economic value added (tax-effected operating earnings, as defined by the company, less a charge for net operating assets employed). Our goal is to increase economic value added on an annual basis. Other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); diluted earnings per share; operating cash flow and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods. Nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics and production and sales volumes. Additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).
We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of Ball and, because of this, we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the companys common stock as part of a diversified portfolio. For most management employees, a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive, dependent upon economic value-added operating performance. For more senior positions, more compensation is at risk through economic value-added performance and various stock compensation plans. Through our employee stock purchase plan and 401(k) plan, which matches employee contributions with Ball common stock, employees, regardless of organizational level, have opportunities to own Ball stock.
CONSOLIDATED SALES AND EARNINGS The company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines, after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics: (1)metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia; (2)metal beverage packaging, Europe; (3)metal food and household products packaging, Americas; (4)plastic packaging, Americas; and (5)aerospace and technologies. We also have investments in companies in the U.S., the PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings.
Due to first quarter 2008 management reporting changes, Balls operations in the PRC with 2008 net sales of $289.6million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment (previously included within the companys European operations). Also, effective January1, 2007, a plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of $52.1million was transferred from the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment. Prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to the current presentation.
Page 21 of 96 Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas and Asia The metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through fiscal year 2008) and the PRC, which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as non-beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the PRC.
This segment accounted for 40percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (41percent in 2007, including the impact from the $85.6 million legal settlement with Miller discussed below, and 42percent in 2006). Excluding the effect of the legal settlement, sales were 4percent lower in 2008 than in 2007, primarily as a result of 2008 decreases in North American sales volumes of approximately 5 percent. The decrease in North American sales volumes was due primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers, consistent with the industry, and lost beer sales volumes on discontinuance of a contract that did not provide sufficient profitability. This decrease was somewhat offset by sales volume increases in the PRC of 14 percent during 2008. Sales were 10 percent higher in 2007 than in 2006 (7percent higher including the effect from the legal settlement) with flat volumes being offset by higher sales prices, which were primarily due to rising aluminum prices and the pass through of various cost increases to customers. Based on publicly available information, we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 30percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments and 22 percent of total PRC shipments in 2008. We continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business, which includes cans of different shapes, diameters and fill volumes, and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions.
During the second quarter of 2007, Miller asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by the subsidiary, and on October 4, 2007, the dispute was settled in mediation. Miller received $85.6 million ($51.8 million after tax) on settlement of the dispute, and Ball retained all of Millers beverage can and end supply through 2015. Miller received a one-time payment of $70.3 million ($42.5million after tax) in January2008 (recorded on the December31, 2007, consolidated balance sheet in other current liabilities) with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract, which extends through 2015. On July 1, 2008, Millers business was combined with the U.S. business of Coors Brewing Company, which we also supply, to form MillerCoors, LLC.
Segment earnings in 2008 were $243.5million ($284.1 million excluding business consolidation costs discussed in more detail below) compared to $240.8million ($326.4 million excluding the legal settlement) in 2007 and $285.8million in 2006. Excluding the $40.6 million in business consolidation charges in 2008 and $85.6 million settlement in 2007, earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by 13 percent, primarily due to raw material inventory gains of $52 million realized in 2007, which did not recur in 2008. Earnings in 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower North American sales volumes, which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the PRC. Positive cost impacts from a new end technology project commenced in 2006 and other cost optimization measures partially offset the prior year non-recurring inventory gain and the unfavorable net sales volume decreases. The higher segment earnings in 2007, before the legal settlement, compared to 2006 were due to raw material inventory gains in 2007 that exceeded 2006 by approximately $30million. Also contributing were approximately $9million of lower manufacturing costs related to the new end technology project and improved production efficiencies. These gains were offset by increased repair and maintenance costs and higher labor and other conversion costs, a portion of which could not be passed through to our customers.
On April 23, 2008, Ball announced that by the end of 2008 it would close a metal beverage packaging plant in Kent, Washington, and in 2008 recorded pretax charges of $7.1 million ($4.3 million after tax), including the sale of the plant facility in the fourth quarter. The closure of the Kent facility is expected to result in net fixed costs savings of approximately $10 million in 2009. Also in the second quarter of 2008, a gain of $7.2 million ($4.4million after tax) was recorded for the recovery of previously expensed pension, employee severance and other benefit closure obligation costs no longer required. This reflects a decision made in the second quarter to continue to operate existing end-making equipment and not install a new beverage can end module that would have been part of our multi-year project.
On October 30, 2008, Ball announced the closure of two North American metal beverage can plants. A plant in Kansas City, Missouri, which primarily manufactures specialty beverage cans, will be closed by the end of the first quarter 2009, with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other North American beverage can plants. A plant in Puerto Rico, which manufactured 12-ounce beverage cans, was closed at the end of 2008. A pretax charge of Page 22 of 96 approximately $40.7million ($25.2 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 with an additional $5 million ($3million after tax) expected in 2009. Cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected to be up to $30 million in 2009 and be $7 million cash positive upon final disposition of the assets.
Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe The metal beverage packaging, Europe, segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in Europe. Ball Packaging Europe, which represents an estimated 29percent of total European metal beverage container manufacturing capacity, has manufacturing plants located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Serbia, and is the second largest metal beverage container business in Europe.
This segment accounted for 25percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (22 percent in 2007 and 20percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 as compared to 2007 were 13 percent higher due largely to approximately 8 percent higher sales volume, consistent with overall market growth; higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of 8percent on the strength of the euro. These positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes, including product mix changes towards smaller containers. Segment sales in 2007 were 26percent higher than in 2006, due primarily to over 9percent higher sales volume, higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of 9percent on the strength of the euro. Higher segment volumes in both periods were aided by the growth in Europe of specialty can volumes, including the successful introduction of the Ball sleek can into Italy. The slow return of the metal beverage can to the German market, following the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on, is being offset by stronger demand outside Germany.
Segment earnings were $230.9million in 2008, $228.9million in 2007 and $252.3 million ($176.8million excluding a $75.5 million property insurance gain) in 2006. Earnings in 2008 were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of $55 million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives, which exceeded the negative impact from product mix, as well as approximately $20 million related to a stronger euro. These improvements were partially offset by $36 million of higher other costs including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the British pound to the euro and $35.1 million for business interruption recoveries in 2007 that were not repeated in 2008 (for further details see below). Earnings in 2007 compared to 2006, excluding the $75.5million property insurance gain received in 2006 due to a fire at the companys Hassloch, Germany, metal beverage can plant (further details are provided below), were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of $76 million due to the combined impact of increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives, $16million from cost control programs and $13million related to a stronger euro. These improvements were partially offset by $26 million of other higher costs and $15.9million of lower business interruption insurance recognition in 2007.
On April1, 2006, a fire in the metal beverage can plant in Hassloch, Germany, damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment. The property insurance proceeds recorded for the combined years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, which were based on replacement cost, were 86.3million ($109.9million). A 26.7million($33.8million) fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire. As a result, a pretax gain of 59.6million ($75.5million) was recorded in the 2006 consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds. An additional 27.2million ($35.1million) and 40million ($51million) were recorded in cost of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs, as well as 11.3million ($14.3million) in 2006 to offset clean-up costs.
Metal Food and Household Products Packaging, Americas The metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S., Canada and Argentina. The company acquired U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) on March27, 2006, and with that acquisition, added to its metal food can business the production and sale of aerosol cans, paint cans, plastic pails and decorative specialty cans. Effective January1, 2007, responsibility for the plastic pail product line, with 2007 net sales of $52.1million, was transferred to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment. Accordingly, 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer.
Page 23 of 96 This segment accounted for 16percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (16 percent in 2007 and 17percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 increased 3 percent as compared to 2007 mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an approximate 3 percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of decisions by management to discontinue low margin business, which led to the announced closure of our Commerce, California, and Tallapoosa, Georgia, facilities in 2007. We estimate our 2008 shipments account for approximately 19 percent and 50 percent of total annual U.S. and Canadian steel food container and steel aerosol container shipments, respectively. Segment sales in 2007 increased 4 percent as compared to 2006 due to an approximate 10percent increase in sales for the inclusion of a full years sales from the acquisition of U.S. Can, partially offset by a 3percent decline in sales from lost business, as well as customer operating issues in food cans, including a fire in a customers factory, and unfavorable weather conditions in the Midwest.
Segment earnings were $69.7 million ($68.1 million excluding a $1.6 million gain from business consolidation activities) in 2008, compared to a loss of $8million (earnings of $36.2 million excluding business consolidation costs of $44.2 million) in 2007 and earnings of $2.4million ($37.9 million excluding business consolidation costs of $35.5 million) in 2006. Excluding the business consolidation activities for each period, earnings in 2008 exceeded 2007 by approximately 88 percent primarily related to improved pricing, better manufacturing performance and the settlement of a claim in the amount of almost $7 million offset by the negative impact of 3 percent lower sales volumes in 2008. The 4percent lower earnings in 2007 compared to 2006, excluding the business consolidation charges, were primarily related to increased steel and coating material costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing performance in 2007 and higher cost of sales in the second quarter of 2006 related to $6.1million of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory valuations associated with the acquired U.S. Can finished goods inventory. While pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials, other direct materials and freight and utility costs, we continue to seek price increases in the market place.
In October 2007, Ball announced plans to close aerosol manufacturing plants in Tallapoosa, Georgia, and Commerce, California, and announced its intent to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in Baltimore, Maryland. A pretax charge of $44.2million ($26.8million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily related to these closures. Ball incurred additional net pretax charges of $3.5 million primarily related to lease cancellation costs for the closure of the Commerce facility during 2008. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2008, it was determined, based on market conditions that we would remain in the custom and decorative tinplate can business, which resulted in the reversal of $5.4 million in business consolidation charges previously recorded. We closed the Tallapoosa facility early in the first quarter of 2009 and do not anticipate further charges related to this closure. When completed in 2009, the actions are expected to yield annualized pretax cost savings in excess of $15million and improve the aerosol plant utilization rate to more than 85percent from about 70percent. The cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment, a charge of $35.5million ($28.7million after tax) was recorded primarily related to the closure of a plant in Burlington, Ontario, for employee termination and pension costs, plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment charges. The Burlington plant was sold during the third quarter of 2008 completing the restructuring plan, except for pension costs, which resulted in an additional $0.3 million in business consolidation charges.
As reported in our second quarter Form 10-Q, during the third quarter our aerosol business experienced a tinplate supply issue due to a major suppliers failure to deliver committed metal. While this matter affected a limited, seasonal part of this segments product mix, it caused a supply disruption with some of our customers that resulted in lost sales and profitability for Ball during the year. We have made every effort to fulfill our customers requests and minimize the impact on our customer base. We are now receiving the necessary tinplate to produce products for our customers, and future raw material supply arrangements are scheduled.
Plastic Packaging, Americas The plastic packaging, Americas, segment consists of operations located in the U.S. and Canada (through most of the third quarter of 2008), which manufacture PET and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging, as well as high density polyethylene and polypropylene containers for industrial and household product applications. On March 28, 2006, Ball acquired certain North American plastic bottle container Page 24 of 96 assets from Alcan Packaging (Alcan), including two plastic container manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada, as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other Alcan facilities. Effective January1, 2007, the plastic packaging, Americas, segment assumed responsibility for plastic pail assets acquired as part of the U.S. Can acquisition. Accordingly, 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer. Manufacturing operations ceased in Canada during the third quarter of 2008 with the closure of the Brampton, Ontario, plant.
This segment accounted for 9percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (10percent in both 2007 and 2006). Segment sales in 2008 decreased 2 percent, or approximately $17 million, as compared to 2007 due to a decrease of approximately 9percent in sales volume offset by higher raw material cost increases passed through to customers during 2008. The volume loss included decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due, in part, to lower convenience store sales by our customers, which were partially offset by higher sales in specialty business markets (e.g., custom hot-fill, alcohol, food and juice drinks). Reduced preform sales also contributed to the 2008 sales decrease due, in part, to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer. Segment sales in 2007 increased 8percent as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in sales of 7percent related to the March 2006 acquisition of Alcan and the inclusion of the acquired U.S. Can plastic pail business, as well as an increase of 3percent for higher sales volumes related to the legacy business.
Segment earnings were $7.5 million in 2008, $25.9million in 2007 and $28.3million in 2006. Excluding the business consolidation charges of $8.3 million in 2008 (further details are provided below) and $0.4 million in 2007, earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by approximately 40 percent primarily due to the previously mentioned volume losses and a $1.8 million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing during the second quarter of 2008. Earnings in 2007 were lower than in 2006 primarily due to lower sales margins related to approximately $5million of customer pricing concessions and $2million of higher labor and overhead costs. The earnings inhibitors were partially offset by approximately $2million from volume growth in specialty PET sales combined with the incremental margin impact of sales in the first quarter of 2007 related to the acquired Alcan and U.S. Can plants. In view of the low PET margins, we continue to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives, as well as PET development efforts in the custom hot-fill, beer, wine, flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets. In the polypropylene plastic container arena, development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets.
We estimate our 2008 shipments of PET plastic bottles to be approximately 10percent of total U.S. and Canadian PET container shipments. In addition the plastic packaging, Americas, segment shipped approximately 750million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2008.
On June 26, 2008, Ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in Brampton, Ontario, which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2008. A pretax charge of $8.3 million ($7.8 million after tax) was recorded during 2008 for employee termination and other benefit costs, lease cancellation costs and fixed asset impairment. The Brampton operations have been consolidated into the companys other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the closure of this facility is expected to result in annual, fixed-cost savings of approximately $4 million beginning in 2009.
Aerospace and Technologies Aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 10percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 (11 percent in 2007 and 10percent in 2006). Segment sales in 2008 were 5 percent lower as compared to 2007 as a result of a combination of large programs nearing completion, program terminations, delays in program awards and government funding constraints. The reductions were partially offset by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts. Segment sales in 2007 were 17percent higher than in 2006 due to new programs, cost overruns on fixed-price contracts, increased scope on previously awarded contracts and growth in ourcommercialcontracts.
Some of the segments high-profile contracts include: the WorldView2 advanced commercial remote sensing satellites; the James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; the Space-Based Space Surveillance System, which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris; NPOESS, the next-generation satellite weather monitoring system; and a number of antennas for the Joint Strike Fighter.
Page 25 of 96 Segment earnings in 2008 were $83.3 million ($76.2 million excluding the sale of an Australian subsidiary discussed in more detail below), $64.6million in 2007 and $50million in 2006. Excluding the pretax gain on the sale of BSG of $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2008, earnings in 2008 were up 18 percent in comparison to 2007. Earnings improved year over year as the sales volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on contracts due to improvements in program execution, risk retirement on several fixed price programs, as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and benefit expenses. Earnings improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher net sales, particularly related to the WorldView and other commercial space contracts, an improved contract mix and better program execution.
On February15, 2008, Ball completed the sale of its shares in BSG to QinetiQ Pty Ltd for approximately $10.5million, including cash sold of $1.8 million. BSG provided services to the Australian department of defense and related government agencies. After an adjustment for working capital items, the sale resulted in a pretax gain of $7.1 million.
Sales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 91percent of segment sales in 2008, 84percent in 2007 and 90percent in 2006. Contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at December31, 2008 and 2007, was $597million and $774million, respectively.
Additional Segment Information For additional information regarding the companys segments, see the summary of business segment information in Note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report. The charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by Ball management and were developed from information available at the time. If actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. Additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in Note6 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
Undistributed Corporate Expenses, Net Undistributed corporate expenses, net, were $39.6 million, $38.3 million and $37.5 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the undistributed corporate expenses for 2008 was $11.5 million for mark-to-market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments that will reverse and result in a gain in 2009. These aluminum derivative instruments are fully matched with customer sales arrangements that mature in 2009; therefore, the mark-to-market losses will reverse in 2009 resulting in $11.5 million of pretax earnings.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $288.2million, $323.7million and $287.2million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The decreases in SG&A expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 were due to $7.6million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the sale in February 2008 of the aerospace and technologies segments Australian subsidiary, lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal costs of $3.7 million, life insurance death benefits of $6.5 million, settlement of a claim for approximately $7million, the favorable net year-over-year change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of $11.6 million and other miscellaneous net cost reductions.
The increase in SG&A expenses in 2007 compared to 2006 were $4.5 million of additional SG&A from the U.S. Can acquisition, higher research and development costs and aerospace bid and proposal costs of $9.4million, increased sales and marketing efforts of $5.4million and $15.8million of compensation and benefit increases, including year-over-year incentive compensation costs.
For the U.S. pension plans, we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption of 8.25 percent and our discount rate assumption of 6.25 percent for 2009. Based on these assumptions and excluding 2008 curtailment expense, U.S. pension expense for 2009 is anticipated to increase $3.9 million compared to 2008, most of which will be included in cost of sales. Pension expense in Europe and Canada combined is expected to be comparable tothe 2008 expense. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage Page 26 of 96 point would result in an approximate $2.4 million increase in the 2009 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $2.8 million of additional pension expense in 2009. Additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in Note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report.
Interest and Taxes Consolidated interest expense was $137.7million in 2008, $149.4million in 2007 and $134.4million in 2006. The reduced expense in 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt, as U.S. and European Central Banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis. The higher expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of U.S. Can and the Alcan assets, combined with higher interest rates in 2007.
Balls consolidated effective income tax rate for 2008 was 32.6percent compared to 26.3percent in 2007and 29.4percent in 2006. The lower tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 and 2006 was primarily the result of earnings mix (higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates) and net tax benefit adjustments of $17.2 million recorded in 2007. Additionally, the inability to fully use Canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 and 2006 contributed to higher rates in those years. The 2008 rate was partially reduced by a $4.5 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for an enacted tax law change in the United Kingdom, which was offset by the impact of non-deductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain company-owned life insurance plans. The $17.2 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in Germany and the United Kingdom and a tax loss related to the companys Canadian operations, which were offset by an increase in the tax provision in 2007 to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to a company-owned life insurance plan (discussed below).
Based on current estimates, the 2009 effective income tax rate is expected to be around 33.5percent.
During 2007 the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the IRS on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a company-owned life insurance plan. An additional accrual of $7 million was made in the third quarter of 2007 to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of $18.4 million, including interest, for the years 2000-2004, which were under examination, and for the unaudited years 2005-2006. This settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans, which will not have a significant impact on earnings per share, cash flow or liquidity in future periods. Further details are available in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this report.
Results of Equity Affiliates Equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our 50percent ownership in packaging investments in the U.S. and Brazil. Earnings were $14.5million in 2008, $12.9million in 2007 and $14.7million in 2006.
CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS For information regarding the companys critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. We had in excess of half a billion dollars of available funds under committed multi-currency revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2008. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, the current global credit, financial and economic crisis or any of the other factors we describe in Item1A, Risk Factors.
Page 27 of 96 In our worldwide beverage can business, we use financial derivative contracts as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk within Item 7A of this report to manage future aluminum price volatility for our customers. As these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts, they have little or no economic impact on our earnings. Balls financial counterparties to these derivative contracts require Ball to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark-to-market value of the contracts exceeds specified levels. Additionally, Ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers and other financial counterparties on these derivative contracts. At December 31, 2008, Ball had $229.5 million of cash posted as collateral and had received $124 million of cash from customers for a net amount of $105.5 million. The cash flows of the collateral postings are shown in the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows. Assuming aluminum prices remain unchanged, we would expect to recover all of these cash deposits in 2009.
Cash flows provided by operations were $627.6million in 2008 compared to $673million in 2007 and $401.4million in 2006.
The reduction in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the payment of approximately $70 million in January 2008 of a legal settlement to a customer. This reduction was partially offset by the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation, lower tax payments, lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital during the year. The improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher net earnings before the legal settlement in 2007 and the insurance gain in 2006 related to the Hassloch fire. The improvement in 2007 was also the result of reduced changes in working capital components and lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher pension contributions.
Management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1)to evaluate the companys operating results, (2)to plan stock-buy back levels, (3)to evaluate strategic investments and (4) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital spending). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. An example of such an item included the companys decision in 2007 to contribute an additional $44.5 million ($27.3 million after tax) to its pension plans.Additional examples include property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the fire-damaged assets in our Hassloch, Germany, plant, which are included in capital spending amounts in 2006.
Based on this, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows: ($       in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash       flows from operating activities $ 627.6 $ 673.0 $ 401.4 Capital       spending (306.9 ) (308.5 ) (279.6 ) Proceeds       for replacement of fire-damaged assets  48.6 61.3 Incremental       pension funding, net of tax  27.3  Free       cash flow $ 320.7 $ 440.4 $ 183.1 Based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2009 to be approximately $625million, capital spending to be approximately $250million and free cash flow to be in the $375million range. Capital spending of $306.9million in 2008 exceeded depreciation and amortization expense of $297.4million. We have reduced our expected capital spending year over year, and we do not intend to buy back stock until the capital markets show sufficient signs of recovery. Initially in 2009 we will focus on reducing our debt and growing our cash balances.
Debt Facilities and Refinancing Interest-bearing debt at December31, 2008, increased $51.5million to $2.41billion from $2.36billion at December31, 2007. The 2008 debt increase from 2007 was primarily due to the financing of $105.5 million in net cash collateral deposits. In 2009 we intend to allocate our operating cash flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while covering our capital spending programs, dividends and incremental pension funding.
At December31, 2008, $502million was available under the companys multi-currency revolving credit facilities. The company also had $332million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year, of which $155.6million was outstanding. The committed credit facilities are available until October 2011.
Page 28 of 96 Given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until October 2011, the companys liquidity is strong and is expected to meet its ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements. While the current financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties, thus limiting exposure with any one party. The company also monitors the credit ratings of its suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.
The current financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit risks with some of our customers and suppliers. In October 2008, we advanced interest-bearing funding of $22 million in support of one of our key suppliers, which advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory.
The company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing, revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of Balls North American packaging operations up to $250million. The agreement qualifies as off-balance sheet financing under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.140, as amended by SFASNo.156. Net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled $250million and $170 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.
The company was in compliance with all loan agreements at December31, 2008, and all prior years presented, and has met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements, bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Additional details about the companys debt and receivables sales agreements are available in Notes15 and 9, respectively, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report.
Other Liquidity Items Cash payments required for long-term debt maturities, rental payments under noncancellable operating leases, purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at December31, 2008, are summarized in the following table: Payments       Due By Period (a) ($       in millions) Total Less       than 1Year 1-3       Years 3-5       Years More       than 5Years Long-term       debt $ 2,250.7 $ 147.3 $ 1,140.5 $ 509.3 $ 453.6 Capital       lease obligations 3.8 0.5 0.8 0.8 1.7 Interest       payments on long-term debt (b) 485.2 98.7 166.4 93.3 126.8 Operating       leases 187.3 46.7 66.0 36.7 37.9 Purchase       obligations (c) 3,818.9 2,004.9 1,632.3 181.7  Total       payments on contractual obligations $ 6,745.9 $ 2,298.1 $ 3,006.0 $ 821.8 $ 620.0 (a) Amounts       reported in local currencies have been translated at the year-end exchange       rates.
(b) For       variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at       year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging       instruments.
(c) The       companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum,       steel, plastic resin and other direct materials. Also included are       commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, aerospace and       technologies contracts and other less significant items. In cases where       variable prices and/or usage are involved, managements best estimates       have been used. Depending on the circumstances, early termination of the       contracts may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments       could vary significantly.
Page 29 of 96 Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, may be in the range of $88million to $93 million in 2009. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $69.5million, $73.7million, $76.4million, $81million and $84.5million for the years ending December 31, 2009 through 2013, respectively, and a total of $482.7million for the years 2014 through 2018. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately $24million to $25 million in each of the years 2009 through 2013 and a total of $125.6million for the years 2014 through 2018.
Our share repurchases in 2008 aggregated $299.6million, net of issuances, compared to $211.3million net of repurchases in 2007 and $45.7million in 2006. The net repurchases in 2008 included a $31 million settlement on January 7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase of 675,000 shares. Additionally, in 2007 net repurchases included a $51.9million settlement on January5, 2007, of a forward contract entered into in December2006 for the repurchase of 1,200,000shares. We do not expect to repurchase a significant number of common shares in 2009.
On December12, 2007, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $100million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the $100million on January7, 2008, and received 2,038,657shares, which represented 90percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and the company received an additional 138,521 shares.
Annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40cents per share in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Total dividends paid were $37.5million in 2008, $40.6million in 2007 and $41million in 2006.
Contingencies The company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which the company participates. We do business in countries outside the U.S., have changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our packaging products and participate in changing capital markets. We attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures, including, at times, the use of certain derivative financial instruments as explained in Item 7A of this report.
From time to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites.
Pursuant to the merger agreement with the former shareholders of U.S. Can, a certain portion of the common share consideration issued for the acquisition of U.S. Can was placed in escrow and was subsequently converted into cash, which was to be used for the settlement of certain post-acquisition claims, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. During the second quarter of 2007, Ball asserted claims against the former shareholders of U.S. Can, which were disputed. The representative for the former shareholders of U.S. Can filed a lawsuit against the company in the first quarter of 2008 seeking a declaration of the parties rights and obligations with respect to the claims asserted by the company. This matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 2008.
Our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future events could affect these estimates. See Note1 to the consolidated financial statements within Item8 of this report for a summary of the companys critical and significant accounting policies.
Management believes that evaluation of Balls performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements.
Page 30 of 96 Forward-Looking Statements The company has made or implied certain forward-looking statements in this report which are made as of the end of the time frame covered by this report. These forward-looking statements represent the companys goals, and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied. From time to time we also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public.

Some factors that could cause the companys actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, demand and preferences; loss of one or more major customers or changes to contracts with one or more customers; insufficient production capacity; changes in senior management; the current global credit crisis and its effects on liquidity, credit risk, asset values and the economy; overcapacity in foreign and domestic metal and plastic container industry production facilities and its impact on pricing; failure to achieve anticipated productivity improvements or production cost reductions, including those associated with capital expenditures such as our beverage can end project; changes in climate and weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power; availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the recent significant increases in resin, steel, aluminum and energy costs, and the ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs; changes in the pricing of the companys products and services; competition in pricing and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; insufficient or reduced cash flow; transportation costs; the number and timing of the purchases of the companys common shares; regulatory action or federal and state legislation including mandated corporate governance and financial reporting laws; the effects of the German mandatory deposit or other restrictive packaging legislation such as recycling laws; interest rates affecting our debt; labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs, including pension, medical and health care costs; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses of the companys defined benefit retirement plans; boycotts; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other litigation; maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation; accounting changes; local economic conditions; the authorization, funding, availability and returns of contracts for the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts and related services provided thereunder; delays, extensions and technical uncertainties, as well as schedules of performance associated with such segment contracts; the current global credit situation; international business and market risks such as the devaluation or revaluation of certain currencies and the activities of foreign subsidiaries; international business risks (including foreign exchange rates and activities of foreign subsidiaries) in Europe and particularly in developing countries such as the PRC and Brazil; changes in the foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against the European euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and Argentine peso, and in the foreign exchange rate of the European euro against the British pound, Polish zloty, Serbian dinar and Indian rupee; terrorist activity or war that disrupts the companys production or supply; regulatory action or laws including tax, environmental, health and workplace safety, including in respect of chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process , particularly the recent publicity concerning Bisphenol-A, or BPA, a chemical used in the manufacture of many types of containers (including certain of those produced by the company) ; technological developments and innovations; successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures and the integration activities associated therewith; changes to unaudited results due to statutory audits of our financial statements or managements evaluation of the companys internal controls over financial reporting; and loss contingencies related to income and other tax matters, including those arising from audits performed by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. If the company is unable to achieve its goals, then the companys actual performance could vary materially from those goals expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The company currently does not intend to publicly update forward-looking statements except as it deems necessary in quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Page 31 of 96 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Financial Instruments and Risk Management In the ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in regard to common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective.
We have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below.
Commodity Price Risk We manage our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot-based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage packaging net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing.
Most of the plastic packaging, Americas, sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most metal food and household products packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2008 and in 2007, we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur over the next 12 months.
In Europe and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the company's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement to minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes.
Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the companys ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the markets ability to accept price increases and the companys commodity price exposures under its contract terms, a hypothetical 10percent adverse change in the companys steel, aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated $6million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Additionally, if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10percent, we estimate there could be an $8million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates.
The company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity, as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost. A hypothetical 10percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices, without considering such pass-through provisions, could result in an estimated $7million after-tax reduction of net earnings Page 32 of 96 over a one-year period. A hypothetical 10percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated $2million after-tax reduction of net earnings over the same period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. Subsequent to year end, the company has taken further steps to reduce its exposure to natural gas and diesel fuel prices in 2009.
Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2008, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. Collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate.
Based on our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2008, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments, a 100-basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated $7million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys earnings. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Serbian dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the companys European operations into U.S. dollars.
Considering the companys derivative financial instruments outstanding at December31, 2008, and the currency exposures, a hypothetical 10percent reduction (U.S. dollar strengthening) in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar could result in an estimated $18million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. This amount includes the $8million currency exposure discussed above in the Commodity Price Risk section. This hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by $84million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes.
Common Share Repurchases As part of the companys ongoing share repurchase program and as a way to partially reduce the earnings volatility of the companys variable deferred compensation stock program, from time to time the company sells equity put options on its common stock. The company currently has 500,000 shares of equity put options outstanding at a strike price of $40 per share that expire in less than 12 months.
On December3, 2007, Ball entered into a forward repurchase agreement for the purchase of 675,000shares of its common stock. This agreement was settled for $31million on January7, 2008, and the shares were delivered that day. On December12, 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately $100million. The agreement provided for the delivery of 2,038,657shares, which represented 90percent of the total estimated shares to ultimately be delivered. The $100million was paid on January7, 2008, at the time the shares were delivered. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and the company received an additional 138,521shares.
Page 33 of 96 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ball Corporation: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Page 38 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 1. Critical and Significant Accounting Policies In the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingencies and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Critical Accounting Policies The company considers certain accounting policies to be critical, as their application requires managements best judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Following is a discussion of the accounting policies we consider critical to our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition in the Aerospace and Technologies Segment Sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment are primarily recognized under the cost-to-cost, percentage-of-completion method. This business segment sells using two types of long-term sales contracts  cost-type sales contracts, which represent approximately two-thirdsof sales, and fixed price sales contracts, which account for the remainder. A cost-type sales contract is an agreement to perform the contract for cost plus an agreed upon profit component, whereas fixed price sales contracts are completed for a fixed price or involve the sale of engineering labor at fixed rates per hour. Cost-type sales contracts can have different types of fee arrangements, including fixed fee, cost, milestone and performance incentive fees, award fees or a combination thereof.
During initial periods of sales contract performance, our estimates of base, incentive and other fees are established at a conservative estimate of profit over the period of contract performance. Throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost and extent of progress toward completion. Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period that such losses are determined to be probable. Because of sales contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable generally include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed. As a prime U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, the aerospace and technologies segment is subject to a high degree of regulation, financial review and oversight by the U.S. government.
Acquisitions The company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method as required by SFAS No.141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141). Under SFASNo.141, the acquiring company allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified and named, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Among other sources of relevant information, the company uses independent appraisals and actuarial or other valuations to assist in determining the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities. SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007)) replaces the original SFASNo.141 issued in June2001 effective January 1, 2009, as discussed below in the new accounting standards.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually and when circumstances require utilizing the two-step impairment test prescribed by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), using the notion of implied fair value in the second step whenever a potential impairment is identified in the first step. For this evaluation, our reporting units are consistent with our reportable segments identified in Note 2 except that assets within metal beverage packaging, Americas, are tested separately from those in Asia. These reporting units have been identified based on the level at which discrete financial information is available to segment management. The fair values of goodwill are estimated using the net present value of discounted cash Page 39 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 1. Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) flows, excluding any financing costs or dividends, generated by each reporting unit. Our discounted cash flows are based upon reasonable and appropriate assumptions, which are weighted for their likely probability of occurrence, about the underlying business activities of our reporting units. We recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. When a business within a reporting unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition using the relative fair value methodology. Our methodology of valuing goodwill has not changed from the prior year.
We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. We test annually, and when circumstances require, intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment, which are written down to fair value as deemed necessary.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Employee Benefits The company has defined benefit plans that cover the majority of its employees. We also have postretirement plans that provide certain medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS No.158; SFAS No.87,  Employers Accounting for Pensions;  SFAS No.106,  Employers  Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions  and SFASNo.112, Employers  Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43. These statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary scale inflation rates, health care cost trend rates, mortality and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates, because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.
Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by the plan. For pension plans, accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10percent corridor, the prior service cost and the transition asset are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the average remaining service period of active participants. For other postemployment benefits, the 10percent corridor is not used.
Effective with its December31, 2006, year-end reporting, Ball adopted SFASNo.158, which requires the recognition of the funded status of each defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the consolidated balance sheet. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset, and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability.
In addition to defined benefit and postretirement plans, the company maintains reserves for employee medical claims, up to our insurance stop-loss limit, and workers compensation claims. These are regularly evaluated and revised, as needed, based on a variety of information, including historical experience, actuarial estimates and current employee statistics.
Taxes on Income Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carry forwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions.
Page 40 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 1. Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported in the financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities.
In June2006 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN)48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as a tax expense, consistent with the practice prior to adoption. Additional details about the adoption of FIN48 are provided in Note16. In May 2007 the FASB amended FIN48 by issuing FASB Staff Position (FSP)FIN48-1, which provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The adoption of FSPFIN48-1 did not result in any changes to the amounts recorded in accordance with FIN48.
Business Consolidation Costs The company estimates its liabilities for business consolidation activities by accumulating detailed estimates of costs and asset sales proceeds, if any, for each business consolidation initiative. This includes the estimated costs of employee severance, pension and related benefits; impairment of property and equipment and other assets, including estimates of net realizable value; accelerated depreciation; contract termination payments for contracts and leases; contractual obligations and any other qualifying costs related to the exit plan. These estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall exit plan and are then monitored on a monthly basis. Such disclosures represent management  s best estimates, but require assumptions about the plans that may change over time. Changes in estimates for individual locations and other matters are evaluated periodically to determine if a change in estimate is required for the overall restructuring plan. Subsequent changes to the original estimates are included in current period earnings and identified as business consolidation gains or losses.
Derivative Financial Instruments The company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, product sales, raw materials purchasing, inflation rates and common share repurchases. The companys derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a recognized asset or liability, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, or a derivative designated as a fair value hedge of a firm commitment not yet recorded on the balance sheet, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss associated with all hedges is reported in earnings immediately. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with gains and losses also reported immediately in earnings. In the statements of cash flows, derivative activities are classified in the same category as the items being hedged. The accounting for our cash collateral calls related to our derivative activities are classified as investing activities as discussed in Note 3.
Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of earnings consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged. Gains and losses upon the early termination of effective derivative contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive earnings and amortized to earnings in the same period as the originally hedged items affect earnings.
Page 41 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 1. Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ball Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our). Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in which we do not exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents have original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method of accounting.
Depreciation and Amortization Property, plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings and improvements  10 to 40years; machinery and equipment  3 to 15years; other intangible assets  13 years, weighted average).
Deferred financing costs are amortized over the life of the related loan facility and are reported as part of interest expense. When debt is repaid prior to its maturity date, the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs, or pro rata portion thereof, is also reported as interest expense.
Under certain business consolidation activities, accelerated depreciation may be required over the remaining useful life for designated assets to be scrapped or abandoned. The accelerated depreciation related to plant closures is disclosed as part of the business consolidation costs in the appropriate period.
Environmental Reserves We estimate the liability related to environmental matters based on, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matters and revise our estimates.
Revenue Recognition in the Packaging Segments Sales of products in the packaging segments are recognized when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
Fair Value Measurements Effective January 1, 2008, the company adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which establishes a framework for measuring value and emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Fair value losses or gains are reported in earnings when identified.
Page 42 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 1. Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Stock-Based Compensation Ball has a variety of restricted stock and stock option plans. The compensation cost associated with restricted stock grants has been calculated using the fair value at the date of grant and amortized over the restriction period. Stock-based compensation is reported as part of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Ball amended one of its deferred compensation stock plans to allow for limited diversification beginning in 2007, which required an initial mark-to-market adjustment of $6.7million.
Effective January1, 2006, the company adopted SFASNo.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, and elected to use the modified prospective transition method and the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected stock price volatility assumption utilized in the model was calculated from the historical method. Tax benefits associated with option exercises are reported in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Further details regarding the expense calculated under the fair value based method are provided in Note18.
Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings as a component of shareholders equity.
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.
Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standards SFAS No. 157 became effective for Ball on January 1, 2008. At this time, the January1, 2008, adoption covers only financial assets and liabilities and those nonfinancial assets and liabilities already disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis but, subject to a deferral, will be expanded to all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities as of January1, 2009. The company is in the process of evaluating what impact applying SFAS No. 157 to all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have on its consolidated financial statements but does not anticipate any material impact at this time. Details regarding the adoption of SFASNo.157 and its effects on the companys consolidated financial statements are available in Note20.
New Accounting Standards In December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). This statement amends accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, requiring that such interests be reported as a separate component of shareholders equity. SFAS No. 160 also requires separate presentation in the consolidated statements of income of net income allocable to the noncontrolling interests from that attributable to the companys shareholders. This statement is effective for Ball beginning on January 1, 2009, and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Page 43 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 1. Critical and Significant Accounting Policies (continued) In December2007 the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), which replaces the original SFASNo.141 issued in June2001. The new standard retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No.141 that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFASNo.141 (revised 2007) requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at their fair values on the acquisition date, which replaces SFASNo.141s cost-allocation process. This standard also requires all costs to effect the acquisition and any related restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred. The new standard will be effective for Ball beginning on January1, 2009, inasmuch as we enter into a business combination transaction.
In March2008 the FASB issued SFASNo.161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an Amendment of FASB Statement No.133 (SFAS No. 161). SFASNo.161 is intended to enhance the current disclosure requirements in SFASNo.133. It requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation, as well as information about credit-risk-related contingent features. It also requires a company to disclose the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format to make the location of the derivative positions existing at period end and the effect of using derivatives during the reporting period more transparent in the companys financial statements. The company also will be required to cross-reference information about derivative instruments within the footnotes to help users of the financial statements. SFASNo.161 is effective for Ball beginning on January1, 2009, and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In April2008 the FASB issued FSPNo.142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP No. 142-3). This guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for Ball as of January1, 2009, on a prospective basis, and early adoption is prohibited. The company does not anticipate it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at this time.
In November 2008 the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 08-06, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations (EITF 08-06). EITF 08-06 requires an entity to measure its equity method investment initially at cost, to recognize other-than-temporary impairments recorded by an investee and to account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment. The guidance will be effective for Ball on January 1, 2009. The company does not anticipate it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at this time.
Also in November 2008, the EITF issued EITF 08-07, Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets (EITF 08-07). EITF 08-07 requires that a defensive intangible asset (acquired intangible asset that the acquirer does not intend to actively use for more than a transition period) be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting with a useful life that reflects the entitys consumption of the expected benefits related to that asset and not be aggregated with an entitys existing intangible assets. The guidance will be effective for Ball on January 1, 2009, inasmuch as we enter into a business combination.
In December 2008 the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures About Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1).
This guidance requires disclosure of how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies, the major categories of plan assets, significant concentrations of risk within plan assets, inputs and valuation techniques to measure fair value and the effect of significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period. FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for Ball for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009. The company is in the process of evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Page 44 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 2. Business Segment Information Balls operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines, after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics resulting in five reportable segments. Due to first quarter 2008 management reporting changes, Balls operations in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) with 2008 net sales of $289.6million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, segment (previously included with the companys European operations). Also, effective January1, 2007, a plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of $52.1million was transferred from the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment to the plastic packaging, Americas, segment. Prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to the current presentation.
Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia : Consists of operations in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico (through the end of 2008) and the PRC, which manufacture and sell metal beverage containers in North America and the PRC, as well as non-beverage plastic containers in the PRC.
Metal beverage packaging, Europe : Consists of operations in several countries in Europe, which manufacture and sell metal beverage containers.
Metal food & household products packaging, Americas : Consists of operations in the U.S., Canada and Argentina, which manufacture and sell metal food cans, aerosol cans, paint cans and decorative specialty cans.
Plastic packaging, Americas : Consists of operations in the U.S. and Canada (through most of the third quarter of 2008), which manufacture and sell polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene containers, primarily for use in beverage and food packaging. This segment also includes the manufacture and sale of plastic containers used for industrial and household products.
Aerospace and technologies : Consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and the providing of services used primarily in the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements. We also have investments in companies in the U.S., PRC and Brazil, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings.

Page 48 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 3. Collateral Calls In our worldwide beverage can business, we use financial derivative contracts to manage future aluminum price volatility for our customers. As these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts, they have little or no economic impact on our earnings. Balls financial counterparties to these derivative contracts require Ball to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark-to-market value of the contracts exceeds specified levels.Additionally, Ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers and financial counterparties on these derivative contracts. At December 31, 2008, Ball had $229.5 million of cash posted as collateral and had received $124 million of cash from customers for a net amount of $105.5 million. The cash flows of the posted collateral calls are shown within the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows. The majority of these contracts settle during 2009.
4. Acquisitions 2006 U.S. Can Corporation On March27, 2006, Ball acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of U.S. Can Corporation (U.S. Can) for 444,756common shares of Ball Corporation (valued at $44.28 per share for a total of $19.7million). Contemporaneously with the acquisition, Ball also refinanced $598.2million of U.S. Can debt, including $26.8million of bond redemption premiums and fees, and the company expects to realize tax benefits of approximately $44million from acquired net operating tax loss and credit carryforwards of which approximately $25million have been realized as of December31, 2008. The acquired operations are included in the metal food and household products packaging, Americas, segment, except for a plastic pail product line that was transferred to the companys plastic packaging, Americas, segment effective January1, 2007, for which 2006 amounts have been retrospectively adjusted. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, its results have been included in the consolidated financial statements since March27, 2006.
Alcan Packaging On March28, 2006, Ball acquired North American plastic bottle container assets from Alcan Packaging (Alcan) for $184.7million cash. The acquired business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles used in food packaging and, to a lesser extent, barrier PET plastic bottles used for beverages and food. The operations acquired form part of Balls plastic packaging, Americas, segment.

A plant in Kansas City, Missouri, which primarily manufactures specialty beverage cans, will be closed by the end of the first quarter of 2009 with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other North American beverage can plants. A plant in Puerto Rico, which manufactured 12-ounce beverage cans, was closed at the end of 2008. A pretax charge of $40.7million ($25.2 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge included $17 million for employee severance, pension and other employment benefit costs; and $9 million of accelerated depreciation and $14 million for the write down to net realizable value of certain fixed assets and related spare parts. All remaining costs, excluding pension costs of $6 million, are expected to be incurred or paid during 2009. The carrying value of fixed assets remaining for sale in connection with the plant closures was $5.5 million at December31, 2008.

Taxes on Income (continued) The income tax provision recorded within the consolidated statements of earnings differs from the provision determined by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to pretax earnings as a result of the following: ($       in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Statutory       U.S. federal income tax $ 158.5 $ 127.6 $ 156.4 Increase       (decrease) due to: Foreign       tax rate differences (24.2 ) (6.3 ) (1.1 ) Company-owned       life insurance 2.5 (3.9 ) (5.8 ) Research       and development tax credits (5.0 ) (4.5 ) (11.6 ) Manufacturing       deduction (3.6 ) (3.3 ) (2.0 ) Foreign       losses with no tax benefit 4.1   United       Kingdom legislative change for depreciation (4.5 )   State       and local taxes, net 10.2 3.9 9.0 Foreign       tax holiday (0.3 ) (1.3 ) (6.1 ) Uncertain       tax positions, including interest 8.7 11.5  Statutory       rate reduction  (10.4 )  Foreign       subsidiary stock loss  (17.2 )  Foreign       exchange loss of European subsidiary   (8.1 ) Other,       net 1.0 (0.4 ) 0.9 Provision       for taxes $ 147.4 $ 95.7 $ 131.6 Effective       tax rate expressed as a percentage       ofpretaxearnings 32.6 % 26.3 % 29.4 % The lower tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 and 2006 was primarily the result of earnings mix (higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates) and net tax benefit adjustments of $17.2 million recorded in 2007. Additionally, the inability to fully use Canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 and 2006 contributed to higher rates in those years. The 2008 rate was partially reduced by a $4.5 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for a law that was enacted, which changed the treatment of statutory tax depreciation in the United Kingdom. This was offset by the impact of non-deductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain company-owned life insurance plans. The $17.2 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was primarily a result of income tax rate reductions enacted in Germany and the United Kingdom and a tax loss related to the companys Canadian operations, which were offset by an increase in the tax provision in 2007 to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to a company-owned life insurance plan.
In 1995 Ball Packaging Europes Polish subsidiary was granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, an exemption was granted on manufacturing earnings for up to 39.5million of income tax. The tax exemption was fully utilized as of December 31, 2007. In 2005 Ball Packaging Europes Serbian subsidiary was granted a tax holiday. Under the terms of the holiday, the earnings of this subsidiary are exempt from income taxation for a period of 10years beginning in the first year the Serbian subsidiary has taxable earnings. As of December31, 2008, the 10-year period had commenced and seven years remain.
Net income tax payments were $120.3million, $63.6million and $138.6million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Taxes on Income (continued) The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were: ($       in millions) 2008 2007 Deferred       tax assets: Deferred       compensation $ 76.0 $ 64.2 Accrued       employee benefits 95.5 105.0 Plant       closure costs 33.5 32.1 Accrued       pensions 116.5 33.4 Inventory       and other reserves 24.1 25.8 Net       operating losses 36.9 45.2 Unrealized       losses on derivative transactions 42.7 0.7 Other 28.6 22.3 Total       deferred tax assets 453.8 328.7 Valuation       allowance (24.0 ) (17.8 ) Net       deferred tax assets 429.8 310.9 Deferred       tax liabilities: Depreciation (266.1 ) (261.6 ) Goodwill       and other intangible assets (85.2 ) (81.4 ) LIFO       inventory reserves (13.5 ) (19.6 ) Other (20.3 ) (22.9 ) Total       deferred tax liabilities (385.1 ) (385.5 ) Net       deferred tax asset (liability) $ 44.7 $ (74.6 ) At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the net deferred tax asset (liability) was included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows: ($       in millions) 2008 2007 Deferred       taxes and other current assets $ 91.1 $ 48.3 Intangibles       and other assets, net 26.0 4.3 Income       taxes payable  (1.4 ) Deferred       taxes and other liabilities (72.4 ) (125.8 ) Net       deferred tax asset (liability) $ 44.7 $ (74.6 ) The change in deferred taxes during 2008 is primarily attributable to the increase in accrued pension and derivative liabilities.
At December31, 2008, Ball Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards, expiring between 2021 and 2026, of $32.7million with a related tax benefit of $13.6million. Also at December31, 2008, Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards, with no expiration date, of $48.4million with a related tax benefit of $11.2million. Balls Canadian subsidiaries had a net operating loss carryforward, with no expiration date, of $38.4million with a related tax benefit of $12.1million. Due to the uncertainty of ultimate realization, these European and Canadian benefits have been offset by valuation allowances of $8.7million and $11.5 million, respectively. At December31, 2008, the company has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $5.1 million and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5.8million; however, due to the uncertainty of realization of the entire foreign tax credit, a valuation allowance of $3.8million has been applied to reduce the carrying value to $2 million.
Page 59 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 16. Taxes on Income (continued) Effective January1, 2007, Ball adopted FINNo.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.A rollforward of the unrecognized tax benefits for 2008 follows: ($       in millions) Unrecognized       Tax Benefit Balance       at January 1, 2007 $ 45.8 Additions       based on tax positions related to the current year 3.9 Additions       for tax positions of prior years 7.6 Reductions       for settlements (18.4 ) Effect       of foreign currency exchange rates 2.2 Balance       at January 1, 2008 41.1 Additions       based on tax positions related to the current year 5.6 Additions       for tax positions of prior years 3.1 Effect       of foreign currency exchange rates (1.0 ) Balance       at December 31, 2008 $ 48.8 Balance       sheet classification: Income       taxes payable $ 4.2 Deferred       taxes and other liabilities 44.6 Total $ 48.8 The 2008 provision for income taxes included an $8.7 million accrual under FINNo.48 compared to $11.5million accrued in 2007. The majority of the 2007 FIN No. 48 provision was related to the effective settlement during the third quarter of 2007 with the Internal Revenue Service for interest deductions on incurred loans from a company-owned life insurance plan.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2008, that, if recognized, would reduce tax expense is $44.3million. At this time there are no positions where the unrecognized tax benefit is expected to increase or decrease significantly within the next 12months. U.S. Federal and state income tax returns filed for the years 2000-2007 are open for audit, with an effective settlement of the Federal returns through 2004. The income tax returns filed in Europe for the years 2002 through 2007 are also open for audit. The companys significant filings in Europe are in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Serbia and the United Kingdom.
The company recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Ball recognized $3.1 million and $2.7million of additional income tax expense in 2008 and 2007, respectively, for potential interest on these items.
The accrual for uncertain tax positions at December31, 2008, includes approximately $8million representing potential interest expense. No penalties have been accrued.
Managements intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings of Balls controlled foreign corporations and, as a result, no U.S. income or foreign withholding tax provision has been made. It is not practicable to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings.

The employee becomes a general unsecured creditor of the company with respect to amounts deferred. Amounts deferred into the deferred compensation stock plan receive a 20percent company match with a maximum match of $20,000 per year. Amounts deferred into the stock plan are represented in the participant's account as stock units, with each unit having a value equivalent to one share of Balls common stock. Beginning in 2007, participants in the stock plan were allowed to reallocate a prescribed number of units to other notional investment funds subject to specified time constraints.
The company  s pension plans cover substantially all U.S., Canadian and European employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The defined benefit plans for salaried employees, as well as those for hourly employees in Germany and the United Kingdom, provide pension benefits based on employee compensation and years of service. Plans for North American hourly employees provide benefits based on fixed rates for each year of service. While the German plans are not funded, the company maintains book reserves, and annual additions to the reserves are generally tax deductible. With the exception of the German plans, our policy is to fund the plans in amounts at least sufficient to satisfy statutory funding requirements taking into consideration what is currently deductible under existing tax laws and regulations.

Page 63 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 17. Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the North American plans at December31 were: U.S.
Canada 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Discount       rate 6.25% 6.25% 6.00% 7.00% 5.75% 5.00% Rate       of compensation increase 4.80% 4.80% 4.80% 3.50% 3.50% 3.50% Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the European plans at December31 were: United       Kingdom Germany 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Discount       rate 6.10% 5.70% 5.00% 5.75% 5.50% 4.50% Rate       of compensation increase 3.80% 4.00% 4.00% 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% Pension       increase 2.50% 3.10% 2.75% 1.75% 1.75% 1.75% The discount and compensation increase rates used above to determine the benefit obligations at December31, 2008, will be used to determine net periodic benefit cost for 2009.
A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an approximate $2.4 million increase in the 2009 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $2.8 million of additional pension expense in 2009.
Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the North American plans for the years ended December31 were: U.S.
Canada 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Discount       rate 6.25% 6.00% 5.75% 5.75% 5.00% 5.00% Rate       of compensation increase 4.80% 4.80% 3.33% 3.50% 3.50% 3.50% Expected       long-term rate of return on assets 8.25% 8.25% 8.50% 6.76% 6.82% 6.78% Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the European plans for the years ended December31 were: United       Kingdom Germany 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Discount       rate 5.70% 5.00% 4.90% 5.50% 4.50% 4.01% Rate       of compensation increase 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% Pension       increase 3.10% 2.75% 2.50% 1.75% 1.75% 1.75% Expected       long-term rate of return on assets 7.25% 7.25% 7.00% N/A N/A N/A Current financial accounting standards require that the discount rates used to calculate the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations reflect thetime value of money as of the measurement date of the benefit obligation and reflect the rates of return currently available on high quality fixed income securities whose cash flows (via coupons and maturities) match the timing and amount of future benefit payments of the plan. In addition changes in the discount rate assumption should reflect changes in the general level of interest rates.
Page 64 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 17. Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) In selecting the U.S. discount rate for December 31, 2008,several benchmarks were considered, including Moody's long-term corporate bond yield forAa bonds and the Citigroup Pension Liability Index. In addition the expected cash flows from the plans were modeled relative to the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matched to cash flows from a portfolio of bonds rated Aa or better.When determining the appropriate discount rate, the company contemplated the impact of lump sum payment options under its U.S. plans when considering the appropriate yield curve. In Canada the markets for locally denominated high-quality, longer term corporate bonds are relatively thin. As a result, the approach taken in Canada was to use yield curve spot rates to discount the respective benefit cash flows and to compute the underlying constant bond yield equivalent. The Canadian discount rate at December31, 2008, was selected based on a review of the expected benefit payments for each of the Canadian defined benefit plans over the next 60 years and then discounting the resulting cash flows to the measurement date using the AA corporate bond spot rates to determine the equivalent level discount rate. In the United Kingdom and Germany, the company and its actuarial consultants considered the applicable iBoxx 15+ year AA corporate bond yields for the respective markets and determined a rate consistent with those expectations. In all countries, the discount rates selected for December31, 2008, were based on therange of values obtained from cash flow specific methods, together with the changes in the general level of interest rates reflected by the benchmarks.
The assumption related to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits over the life of the plans. The assumption was based upon Balls pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance was placed on historical asset returns of our plans. An asset-return generation model was used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class correlation. The analysis included expected future risk premiums, forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indexes, expected inflation and real risk-free interest rate assumptions and the funds expected asset allocation.
The expected long-term rates of return on assets were calculated by applying the expected rate of return to a market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted average expected contributions and benefit payments. The market related value of plan assets used to calculate expected return was $1,052.4million for 2008, $853million for 2007 and $780.7million for 2006.
Included in other comprehensive earnings, net of the related tax effect, was an increase in pension and other postretirement item obligations of $147.8 million in 2008 and decreases in pension and other postretirement item obligations of $57.9million and $55.9million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
For pension plans, accumulated gains and losses in excess of a 10percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets Investment policies and strategies for the plan assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are established by pension investment committees of the company and its relevant subsidiaries and include the following common themes: (1) to provide for long-term growth of principal income without undue exposure to risk, (2) to minimize contributions to the plans, (3) to minimize and stabilize pension expense and (4) to achieve a rate of return above the market average for each asset class over the long term. The pension investment committees are required to regularly, but no less frequently than once annually, review asset mix and asset performance, as well as the performance of the investment managers. Based on their reviews, which are generally conducted quarterly, investment policies and strategies are revised as appropriate.
Page 65 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 17. Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Target asset allocations in the U.S. and Canada are set using a minimum and maximum range for each asset category as a percent of the total funds market value. Assets contributed to the United Kingdom plans are invested using established percentages. Following are the target asset allocations established as of December31, 2008: U.S.
Canada United       Kingdom Cash       and cash equivalents 0-10 % 0-10 %  Equity       securities 30-75 % (a) 50-75 % (c) 55-63 % (d) Fixed       income securities 25-70 % (b) 25-45 % 37-45 % Alternative       investments 0-35 %   (a) Equity       securities may consist of: (1)up to 25percent large cap       equities, (2) up to 10percent mid cap equities, (3)up to       10percent small cap equities, (4)up to 35percent foreign       equities and (5)up to 35percent special equities. Holdings in       Ball Corporation common stock or Ball bonds cannot exceed 5percent       of the trusts assets.
(b) Debt       securities may include up to 10percent high yield non-investment       grade bonds, up to 10percent bank loans and up to 15percent       international bonds.
(c) May       include between 15percent and 45percent non-Canadian equity       securities and must remain within the Canadian tax law for foreign       property limits.
(d) Equity       securities must consist of United Kingdom securities and up to       27percent foreign securities.
The actual weighted average asset allocations for Balls defined benefit pension plans, which are within the established targets for each country, were as follows at December31: 2008 2007 Cash       and cash equivalents 1% 5% Equity       securities 43% 51% Fixed       income securities 47% 36% Alternative       investments 9% 8% 100% 100% Contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded German plans, may be in the range of $88million to $93 million in 2009. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act and actual plan asset performance, among other factors. Benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $69.5million, $73.7million, $76.4million, $81million and $84.5million for the years ending December 31, 2009 through 2013, respectively, and a total of $482.7million for the years 2014 through 2018. Payments to participants in the unfunded German plans are expected to be approximately $24 million to $25million in each of the years 2009 through 2013 and a total of $125.6million for the years 2014 through 2018.
Other Postemployment Benefits The company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution postretirement health care and life insurance plans for substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees. Employees may also qualify for long-term disability, medical and life insurance continuation and other postemployment benefits upon termination of active employment prior to retirement. All of the Ball-sponsored postretirement health care and life insurance plans are unfunded and, with the exception of life insurance benefits, are self-insured.
In Canada, the company provides supplemental medical and other benefits in conjunction with Canadian provincial health care plans. Most U.S. salaried employees who retired prior to 1993 are covered by noncontributory defined benefit medical plans with capped lifetime benefits. Ball provides a fixed subsidy toward each retiree  s future purchase of medical insurance for U.S. salaried and substantially all nonunion hourly employees retiring after January 1, 1993. Life insurance benefits are noncontributory. Ball has no commitments to increase benefits provided by any of the postemployment benefit plans.

Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) An analysis of the change in other postretirement benefit accruals for 2008 and 2007 follows: ($       in millions) 2008 2007 Change       in benefit obligation: Benefit       obligation at prior year end $ 178.0 $ 185.1 Service       cost 3.2 3.1 Interest       cost 10.5 10.2 Benefits       paid (9.5 ) (15.3 ) Net       actuarial gain (0.3 ) (3.1 ) Plan       amendment  (5.9 ) Effect       of exchange rates (4.2 ) 3.9 Benefit       obligation at year end 177.7 178.0 Change       in plan assets: Fair       value of assets at prior year end   Employer       contributions 9.5 15.3 Benefits       paid (10.2 ) (15.4 ) Medicare       Part D subsidy 0.7 0.1 Fair       value of assets at end of year   Funded       status $ (177.7 ) $ (178.0 ) Components of net periodic benefit cost were: ($       in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Service       cost $ 3.2 $ 3.1 $ 3.3 Interest       cost 10.5 10.2 10.8 Amortization       of prior service cost 0.3 0.4 1.5 Recognized       net actuarial gain 0.4 0.6 2.4 Net       periodic benefit cost $ 14.4 $ 14.3 $ 18.0 The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2009 are $0.4million and $0.3million, respectively.
The assumptions used for the determination of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost were the same as those used for the U.S. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans. For other postretirement benefits, accumulated gains and losses, the prior service cost and the transition asset are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.
For the U.S. health care plans at December31, 2008, a 9percent health care cost trend rate was used for pre-65 and post-65 benefits, and trend rates were assumed to decrease to 5percent in 2013 and remain at that level thereafter.For the Canadian plans, a 9percent health care cost trend rate was used, which was assumed to decrease to 5percent by 2017 and remain at that level in subsequent years.
Health care cost trend rates can have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase or decrease the total of service and interest cost by $0.3million and the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4.3million to $4.8million.
Page 67 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 17. Employee Benefit Obligations (continued) Other Benefit Plans Through December31, 2006, the company matched employee contributions to the 401(k) plan with shares of Ball common stock up to 50percent of up to 6percent of a participants annual salary. Effective January1, 2007, the company matches U.S. salaried employee contributions with shares of Ball common stock up to100percent of the first 3percent of a participants salary plus 50percent of the next 2percent. The expense associated with the company match amounted to $20.7million, $20.8million and $16.1million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
In addition substantially all employees within the companys aerospace and technologies segment who participate in Balls 401(k) plan receive a performance-based matching cash contribution of up to 4percent of base salary.The company recognized $8.4million and $8.7million of additional compensation expense related to this program for the years 2008 and 2007, respectively. There was no matching contribution for the year ended December31, 2006.
In 2008 the companys 401(k) plan matching contributions could not exceed $9,200 per employee and the limit on employee contributions was $15,500 per employee.
18. Shareholders Equity At December 31, 2008, the company had 550million shares of common stock and 15 million shares of preferred stock authorized, both without par value. Preferred stock includes 550,000 authorized but unissued shares designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
Under the company  s shareholder Rights Agreement dated July26, 2006, as amended, one preferred stock purchase right (Right) is attached to each outstanding share of Ball Corporation common stock. Subject to adjustment, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $185 per Right. Subject to certain limited exceptions for passive investors, if a person or group acquires 10percent or more of the company's outstanding common stock (or upon occurrence of certain other events), the Rights (other than those held by the acquiring person) become exercisable and generally entitle the holder to purchase shares of Ball Corporation common stock at a 50 percent discount. The Rights, which expire in 2016, are redeemable by the company at a redemption price of $0.001 cent per Right and trade with the common stock. Exercise of such Rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire control of the company without the approval of Ball  s board of directors. The Rights would not interfere with any merger or other business combinations approved by the board of directors.
The company increased its share repurchase program in 2008 to $299.6million, net of issuances, compared to $211.3million net repurchases in 2007 and $45.7million in 2006. The net repurchases in 2008 included a $31 million settlement on January 7, 2008, of a forward contract entered into in December 2007 for the repurchase of 675,000 shares. Additionally, in 2007 net repurchases included a $51.9million settlement on January5, 2007, of a forward contract entered into in December2006 for the repurchase of 1,200,000shares.
On December12, 2007, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy $100million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. The company advanced the $100million on January7, 2008, and received 2,038,657shares, which represented 90percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous days closing price. The agreement was settled on July 11, 2008, and the company received an additional 138,521 shares.
In connection with the employee stock purchase plan, the company contributes 20percent of up to $500 of each participating employees monthly payroll deduction toward the purchase of Ball Corporation common stock. Company contributions for this plan were $3.2 million each in 2008, 2007 and 2006.
Page 68 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 18. Shareholders Equity (continued) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings (Loss) The activity related to accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) was as follows: ($       in millions) Foreign       Currency Translation Pension       and Other Postretirement Items, Net       of Tax Effective       Financial Derivatives, Net       of Tax Accumulated       Other Comprehensive Earnings (Loss) December       31, 2005 $ 74.6 $ (169.9 ) $ (5.4 ) $ (100.7 ) 2006       change 57.2 55.9 6.0 119.1 Effect       of SFASNo.158 adoption (a)  (47.9 )  (47.9 ) December       31, 2006 131.8 (161.9 ) 0.6 (29.5 ) 2007       change 90.0 57.9 (11.5 ) 136.4 December       31, 2007 221.8 (104.0 ) (10.9 ) 106.9 2008       change (48.2 ) (147.8 ) (93.4 ) (289.4 ) December       31, 2008 $ 173.6 $ (251.8 ) $ (104.3 ) $ (182.5 ) (a) W ithin the       companys 2006 annual report, the consolidated statement of changes in       shareholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2006, included a       transition adjustment of $47.9 million, net of tax, related to the       adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit       Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB       Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), as a component of 2006       comprehensive earnings rather than only as an adjustment to accumulated       other comprehensive loss. The 2006 amounts have been revised to correct       the previous reporting.
Managements intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Therefore, no taxes have been provided on the foreign currency translation component for any period. The change in the pension and other postretirement items is presented net of a related tax benefit of $93.9million for 2008 and related tax expense of $31.3million and $2.9million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The change in the effective financial derivatives is presented net of related tax benefit of $42.5million for 2008, related tax benefit of $3.2million for 2007 and related tax expense of $5.7million for 2006.
The pension and other postretirement items component of other comprehensive loss increased significantly in 2008 due to poor stock market performance causing lower than expected pension plan assets (presented in further detail in Note 17).
Page 69 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 18. Shareholders Equity (continued) Stock-Based Compensation Programs The company has shareholder-approved stock option plans under which options to purchase shares of Ball common stock have been granted to officers and employees at the market value of the stock at the date of grant. Payment must be made at the time of exercise in cash or with shares of stock owned by the option holder, which are valued at fair market value on the date exercised. In general, options are exercisable in four equal installments commencing one year from the date of grant and terminating 10 years from the date of grant. A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December31, 2008, follows: Outstanding       Options Nonvested       Options Number       of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Number       of Shares Weighted Average       Grant Date Fair Value Beginning       of year 4,747,005 $ 32.06 1,664,980 $ 10.88 Granted 879,000 50.11 879,000 12.82 Vested (553,770 ) 10.80 Exercised (335,345 ) 19.86 Canceled/forfeited (63,013 ) 45.52 (63,013 ) 11.00 End       of period 5,227,647 35.72 1,927,197 11.78 Vested       and exercisable, end of period 3,300,450 28.26 Reserved       for future grants 3,669,241 The options granted in April2008 included 384,995 stock-settled stock appreciation rights, which have the same terms as the stock options. The weighted average remaining contractual term for all options outstanding at December31, 2008, was sixyears and the aggregate intrinsic value (difference in exercise price and closing price at that date) was $30.7million. The weighted average remaining contractual term for options vested and exercisable at December31, 2008, was 4.5years and the aggregate intrinsic value was $44million. The company received $6.7million from options exercised during 2008. The intrinsic value associated with these exercises was $9.8million, and the associated tax benefit reported as other financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows was $4.3 million. The total fair value of options vested during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6million, $5million and $4.8million, respectively.
These options cannot be traded in any equity market. However, based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, adapted for use in valuing compensatory stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), options granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 have estimated weighted average fair values at the date of grant of $12.82 per share, $11.22per share and $10.46 per share, respectively. The actual value an employee may realize will depend on the excess of the stock price over the exercise price on the date the option is exercised. Consequently, there is no assurance that the value realized by an employee will be at or near the value estimated. The fair values were estimated using the following weighted average assumptions: 2008       Grants 2007       Grants 2006       Grants Expected       dividend yield 0.80 % 0.81 % 0.92 % Expected       stock price volatility 24.48 % 17.94 % 19.70 % Risk-free       interest rate 2.99 % 4.55 % 5.01 % Expected       life of options 5.25       years 4.75       years 4.54       years Page 70 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 18. Shareholders Equity (continued) In addition to stock options, the company issues to officers and certain employees restricted shares and restricted stock units, which vest over various periods. Other than the performance-contingent grants discussed below, such restricted shares and restricted stock units generally vest in equal installments over five years. Compensation cost is recorded based upon the fair value of the shares at the grant date.
To encourage certain senior management employees and outside directors to invest in Ball stock, Ball adopted a deposit share program in March 2001 (subsequently amended and restated in April2004) that matches purchased shares with restricted shares. In general, restrictions on the matching shares lapse at the end of four years from date of grant, or earlier in stages if established share ownership guidelines are met, assuming the relevant qualifying purchased shares are not sold or transferred prior to that time. Grants under the plan are accounted for as equity awards and compensation expense is recorded based upon the closing market price of the shares at the grant date.
The company recorded $3.8million, $6.5million and $6.7million of expense in connection with this program in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
In April2008 and 2007, the companys board of directors granted 246,650and 170,000 performance-contingent restricted stock units, respectively, to key employees, which will cliff-vest if the companys return on average invested capital during a 36-month performance period and 33-month performance period, respectively, is equal to or exceeds the companys cost of capital. If the performance goals are not met, the shares will be forfeited. Current assumptions are that the performance targets will be met and, accordingly, grants under the plan are being accounted for as equity awards and compensation expense is recorded based upon the closing market price of the shares at the grant date. On a quarterly basis, the company reassesses the probability of the goals being met and adjusts compensation expense as appropriate. No such adjustment was considered necessary at the end of 2008 for either grant. The expense associated with the performance-contingent grants totaled $6.2 million and $2.2million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses pretax expense of $20.5million ($12.4million after tax) and $15.9million ($9.6million after tax) and $12.9 million ($7.8 million after tax), respectively, for share-based compensation arrangements. These amounts represented $0.13per both basic and diluted share in 2008, $0.10per basic share and $0.09 per diluted share in 2007, respectively, and $0.08 per basic share and $0.07 per diluted share in 2006, respectively. At December31, 2008, there was $37.5million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized in earnings over a weighted average period of 2.3 years.

20. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Ball adopted SFASNo.157 effective January1, 2008, for financial assets and liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. As discussed in Note1, SFASNo.157 establishes a framework for measuring value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Although it does not require any new fair value measurements, the statement emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As defined in SFASNo.157, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). However, it permits a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient. SFASNo.157 requires that the fair value of a liability include the nonperformance risk (including an entitys credit risk and other risks such as settlement risk) related to the liability being measured.
Page 72 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 20. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) The statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value using the following definitions (from highest to lowest priority):  Level1        Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the       measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.       Level1 primarily consists of financial instruments, such as       exchange-traded derivatives and listed equity   securities.
Level2        Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are       observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term       of the asset or liability. Level2 includes those financial       instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.       These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various       assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value,       volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the       underlying instruments. Substantially all of these assumptions are       observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument,       can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels       at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this       category include non-exchange-traded derivatives, such as over-the-counter       forwards and options.
Level3        Prices or valuation techniques requiring inputs that are both       significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e.,       supported by little or no market activity).
As summarized in the following table, the company has classified allfinancial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2008. The companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

Page 73 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 20. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) The company uses closing spot and forward market prices as published by the London Metal Exchange, the New York Metal Exchange, Reuters and Bloomberg to determine the fair value of its aluminum, currency, energy and interest rate spot and forward contracts.Option contracts are valued using a Black-Scholes model with observable market inputs for aluminum, currency and interest rates. We do not obtain multiple quotes to determine the value for our financial instruments, as we value each of our financial instruments either internally using a single valuation technique or from one reliable observable market source. The company also does not adjust the value of its financial instruments except for in determining the fair value of a trade that settles in the future by discounting the value to its present value using 12-month LIBOR as the discount factor. We perform validations of our internally derived fair values reported for our financial instruments on a quarterly basis utilizing counterparty statements. The company additionally evaluates counterparty creditworthiness and has not identified any circumstances requiring that the reported values of our financial instruments be adjusted as of December 31, 2008.
For the year ended December31, 2008, the company recorded a net pretax gain of $3.9million for the changes in the fair value of its derivative instruments.
21. Financial Instruments and Risk Management Policies and Procedures In the ordinary course of business, we employ established risk management policies and procedures, which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currencies and prices of the companys common stock in regard to common share repurchases, although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including lenders, on a regular basis, but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective.
Commodity Price Risk We manage our North American commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot-based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases. The terms include fixed, floating or pass-through aluminum ingot component pricing. This matched pricing affects most of our North American metal beverage packaging net sales. We also, at times, use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass-through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing.
Most of the plastic packaging, Americas, sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes. As a result, we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin. Most metal food and household products packaging, Americas, sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur, or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs. In 2008 and 2007, we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases. We anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur over the next 12 months.
Page 74 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 21. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued) In Europe and the PRC, the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long-term contracts for the purchase of the materials, as well as certain sales of containers, that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year. These purchase and sales contracts include fixed price, floating and pass-through pricing arrangements. We also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchased volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass-through arrangement to minimize the companys exposure to significant price changes.
The company had aluminum contracts limiting its aluminum exposure with notional amounts of approximately $1.4billion and $1billion at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The aluminum contracts include derivative instruments for which the company elects mark-to-market accounting, as well as cash flow and fair value hedges that offset sales contracts of various terms and lengths. Cash flow and fair value hedges related to forecasted transactions and firm commitments expire within the next four years.
Included in shareholders equity at December31, 2008, within accumulated other comprehensive earnings is a net after-tax loss of $100million associated with these contracts. However, a net loss of $63million is expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months, which will be passed through to customers by higher revenue from sales contracts resulting in no earnings impact to Ball. The consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2008, included $183.7million in other current assets, $137.2 million in long-term other assets, $264.8million in current liabilities and $175.5 million in long-term liabilities related to unrealized gains/losses on unsettled commodity derivative contracts. The consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007, included $32million in other current assets and $50.2million in current liabilities for these gains/losses.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a pretax charge of $11.5 million for mark-to-market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments, which were no longer deemed highly effective for hedge accounting purposes.
Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December31, 2008, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. Collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate.
At December31, 2008, the company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements in Europe with notional amounts of 135million paying fixed rates expiring within the next three years. An approximate $7million net after-tax loss associated with these contracts is included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December31, 2008, of which $4million is expected to be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months. At December31, 2008, the company had outstanding interest rate collars in the U.S. totaling $150million. Ball additionally has $100 million of forward rate agreements expiring in less than three months. The value of these contracts in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December31, 2008, was insignificant. Approximately $3.5million of net gain related to the termination or deselection of hedges is included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at December31, 2008. The amount recognized in 2008 earnings related to terminated hedges was insignificant.
We also use European inflation option contracts to limit the impacts from spikes in inflation against certain multi-year contracts. At December 31, 2008, the company had inflation options in Europe with notional amounts of 115million. The company uses mark-to-market accounting for these options, and the fair value at December 31, 2008, was 0.6million.The contracts expire within the next five years.
Page 75 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 21. Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued) The consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2008, included $1.9million in current liabilities and $8.3 million in long-term liabilities related to unrealized gains/losses on unsettled interest rate instruments. The consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007, included $6.7million in other current assets and $0.1million in current liabilities for these gains/losses.
The fair value of all non-derivative financial instruments approximates their carrying amounts with the exception of long-term debt. Rates currently available to the company for loans with similar terms and maturities are used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt based on discounted cash flows. The fair value of derivatives generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts at December31, taking into account any unrealized gains and losses on open contracts.
2008 2007 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair ($       in millions) Amount Value Amount Value Long-term       debt, including current portion $ 2,254.5 $ 2,183.0 $ 2,308.9 $ 2,323.6 Unrealized       pretax gain (loss) on interest rate derivative contracts (10.6 ) (10.6 ) 5.7 5.7 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the companys quarterly earnings. Our foreign currency translation risk results from the European euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Serbian dinar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, in other currencies. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not a foreign exchange pass-through arrangement, the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. We additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the companys European operations into U.S. dollars. Such contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008, expire within two years, and the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to these contracts were not significant. The consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2008, included $13.3million in other current assets, $1.8 million in long-term other assets, $0.6million in current liabilities and $5.7 million in long-term liabilities related to unrealized gains/losses on unsettled foreign exchange rate contracts. The consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007, included $0.4million in other current assets and $1.9million in liabilities for these gains/losses.

Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred in connection with the companys internal programs for the development of products and processes. Costs incurred in connection with these programs, the majority of which are included in cost of sales, amounted to $32.9million, $27.4million and $22.5million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
24. Subsidiary Guarantees of Debt As discussed in Note15, the companys notes payable and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the companys domestic wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain foreign denominated tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the companys wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The senior credit facilities are secured by: (1) a pledge of 100percent of the stock owned by the company in its material direct and indirect majority-owned domestic subsidiaries and (2) a pledge of the companys stock, owned directly or indirectly, of certain foreign subsidiaries, which equals 65percent of the stock of each such foreign subsidiary. The following is condensed, consolidating financial information (in millions of dollars) for the company, segregating the guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Separate financial statements for the guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries are not presented, because management has determined that such financial statements would not be material to investors.

Contingencies The company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due, in part, to the competitive nature of the industries in which the company participates. We do business in countries outside the U.S., have changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our packaging products and participate in changing capital markets. We attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures, including, at times, the use of certain derivative financial instruments.
From time to time, the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its businesses. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Ball as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. Our information at this time does not indicate that the matters identified will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
Pursuant to the merger agreement with the former shareholders of U.S. Can, a certain portion of the common share consideration issued for the acquisition of U.S. Can was placed in escrow and was subsequently converted into cash, which was to be used for the settlement of certain post-acquisition claims, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. During the second quarter of 2007, Ball asserted claims against the former shareholders of U.S. Can, which were disputed. The representative for the former shareholders of U.S. Can filed a lawsuit against the company in the first quarter of 2008 seeking a declaration of the parties rights and obligations with respect to the claims asserted by the company. This matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 2008.
26. Indemnifications and Guarantees During the normal course of business, the company or its appropriate consolidated direct or indirect subsidiaries have made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which the specified entity may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities, commitments and guarantees include indemnities to the customers of the subsidiaries in connection with the sales of their packaging and aerospace products and services; guarantees to suppliers of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company guaranteeing the performance of the respective entity under a purchase agreement, construction contract or other commitment; guarantees in respect of certain foreign subsidiaries pension plans; indemnities for liabilities associated with the infringement of third party patents, trademarks or copyrights under various types of agreements; indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility, equipment, furniture and other personal property leases for certain claims arising from such leases; indemnities to governmental agencies in connection with the issuance of a permit or license to the company or a subsidiary; indemnities pursuant to agreements relating to certain joint ventures; indemnities in connection with the sale of businesses or substantially all of the assets and specified liabilities of businesses; and indemnities to directors, officers and employees of the company to the extent permitted under the laws of the State of Indiana and the United States of America. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. In addition the majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential future payments the company could be obligated to make. As such, the company is unable to reasonably estimate its potential exposure under these items.
The company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The company does, however, accrue for payments under promissory notes and other evidences of incurred indebtedness and for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnifications, commitments and guarantees, when future payment is both reasonably determinable and probable. Finally, the company carries specific and general liability insurance policies and has obtained indemnities, commitments and guarantees from third party purchasers, sellers and other contracting parties, which the company believes would, in certain circumstances, provide recourse to any claims arising from these indemnifications, commitments and guarantees.
Page 85 of 96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Ball Corporation and Subsidiaries 26. Indemnifications and Guarantees (continued) The companys senior notes and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of the companys wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. Foreign tranches of the senior credit facilities are similarly guaranteed by certain of the companys wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. These guarantees are required in support of the notes and credit facilities referred to above, are co-terminous with the terms of the respective note indentures and credit agreements and would require performance upon certain events of default referred to in the respective guarantees. The maximum potential amounts which could be required to be paid under the guarantees are essentially equal to the then outstanding principal and interest under the respective notes and credit agreement, or under the applicable tranche. The company is not in default under the above notes or credit facilities.
Ball Capital Corp. II is a separate, wholly owned corporate entity created for the purchase of receivables from certain of the companys wholly owned subsidiaries. Ball Capital Corp. IIs assets will be available first to satisfy the claims of its creditors. The company has provided an undertaking to Ball Capital Corp. II in support of the sale of receivables to a commercial lender or lenders who would require performance upon certain events of default referred to in the undertaking. The maximum potential amount which could be paid is equal to the outstanding amounts due under the accounts receivable financing (see Note9). The company, the relevant subsidiaries and Ball Capital Corp. II are not in default under the above credit arrangement.
From time to time, the company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, no such matter, individually or in the aggregate, exists which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Controls       and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures to seek to ensure that material information relating to the company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the companys financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board of directors. Based on their evaluation as of December31, 2008, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2008.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Page 86 of 96 Changes in Internal Control There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2008, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
