BUSINESS Cintas Corporation is a publicly held company, and is primarily a corporate identity uniform company which also provides ancillary services as discussed below. Cintas was founded in 1968 by Richard T. Farmer, Chairman of the Board, when he left his family's industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric. In the early 1970's, Cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business.
Cintas provides a highly specialized service to businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people. Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents, along with other items, to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to its customers as well as the sale of ancillary services including sanitation supplies, first aid and safety products and services and cleanroom supplies.
The rental markets served by Cintas are highly fragmented and competition for this business varies at each of Cintas' locations. There are other companies in the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those of Cintas, although much of the competition consists of smaller local and regional firms. In certain instances, local competitors may also have financial resources comparable to those of Cintas in a particular market. Cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect its operations are quality, service, design and price, in that order.
The service provided to the rental markets served by Cintas principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing on-going uniform replacements as required to each customer. Cintas also offers ancillary products which includes the rental or sale of entrance mats, fender covers, towels, mops, linen products and first aid and safety products and services.
Due to its diverse customer base and average account size, the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on Cintas.
In its sale of customized uniforms, Cintas competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers.
Cintas operates fifteen manufacturing facilities, which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs. Additional products are purchased from several outside suppliers. Because of Cintas' ability to manufacture much of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not have a significant impact on Cintas. Cintas purchases fabric, used in its manufacturing process, from several suppliers. Cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials.
Cintas does not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental remediation that would have a material effect on its financial condition. Cintas is not aware of any material non-compliance with environmental laws.
At May 31, 2001, Cintas employed approximately 24,193 employees of which approximately 832 were represented by labor unions. Cintas considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory.
The table sets forth the revenues derived from each service provided by Cintas.
Year Ended May 31 2001 2000 (in thousands) 1999 Rentals $ 1,610,606 $ 1,424,892 $ 1,297,248 Other Services 550,094 477,099 454,320 $ 2,160,700 $ 1,901,991 $ 1,751,568 ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES Cintas occupies 273 facilities located in 214 cities, of which 113 facilities are leased for various terms ranging from monthly to the year 2019. Cintas expects that it will be able to renew its leases on satisfactory terms. All other properties are owned. The corporate offices provide centrally located administrative functions including accounting, finance, marketing and computer system development and support. Cintas operates processing plants that house administrative, sales and service personnel and the necessary equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and bulk items. Branch operations provide administrative, sales and service functions. Cintas operates seven distribution facilities and has fifteen manufacturing plants. Cintas also operates facilities that distribute first aid products. Cintas considers the facilities it operates to be adequate for their intended use. Cintas owns or leases 6,373 vehicles.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In December 1992, Cintas was served with an "Imminent and Substantial Endangerment and Remediation Order" by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) relating to the facility leased by Cintas in San Leandro, California. The order requires Cintas and three other allegedly responsible parties to respond to alleged soil and groundwater contamination at and around the San Leandro facility. Based on Cintas' prior experience in remediation at similar sites, and based on all available data, the estimated cost associated with the required remediation is approximately $750,000. More precise estimates will not be available until DTSC makes a final decision about remediation activities at the site. Cintas has adequately provided in the financial statements for the potential costs of this remediation.
In acquiring Unitog in March 1999, Cintas became a potentially responsible party, and thus faces the possibility of joint and several liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act in connection with alleged environmental contamination in an area near a rental facility in Tempe, Arizona. This facility, located near the South Indian Bend Wash Federal Superfund site, has been tested for soil and groundwater contamination. Soil testing at Cintas' facility detected volatile organic compounds, and Cintas promptly took steps to remediate the contamination. Groundwater testing in the area of Cintas' property has detected a very low level of volatile organic compound contamination. The United States Environmental Protection Agency in March 1999 issued a Record of Decision to the effect that groundwater contamination in the vicinity of Cintas' plant does not warrant remediation at this time. Instead, the low levels of groundwater contamination near Cintas' facility will be monitored and allowed to attenuate naturally. The Record of Decision requires active groundwater remediation in other parts of the site, which are believed to be unrelated to Cintas. According to the Record of Decision, the EPA estimates that the 30 year net present value of costs to be incurred to remediate and monitor groundwater contamination at the site is $22 million. It is possible that the EPA will attempt to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs it has incurred to date with respect to the site as well as the costs it expects to incur going forward.
As part of the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Unitog Company and Cintas, Cintas performed environmental testing at nine previously untested Unitog laundry facilities. The testing resulted in the discovery of soil and groundwater contamination at certain of these sites. As a result of all of the environmental matters noted above, Cintas recorded a charge to operating expense of $5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 1999 to reflect its current estimate of the additional costs to be incurred relative to these sites. At May 31, 2001, Cintas has an undiscounted liability of $4.6 million for these environmental matters.
Cintas is also a party to incidental litigation brought in the ordinary course of business, none of which individually or in the aggregate, is considered to be material to its operations or financial condition. Cintas maintains insurance coverage against certain liabilities that it may incur in its operations from time to time.

Amounts related to inventory are computed by performing a thorough analysis of future marketability by specific inventory item.
(2) Represents an increase in the appropriate balance sheet reserve due to acquisitions during the respective period, excluding Unitog Company.
(3) Represents reductions in the balance sheet reserve due to the actual write-off of non-collectible accounts receivable or the physical disposal of obsolete inventory items. These amounts do not impact Cintas' income statement.
(4) In the years ended May 31, 1998 and 1999, Cintas acquired several new businesses resulting in a broader and more complex product line. The amount recorded in the year ended May 31, 2000 was significantly less than in the prior years due to the extensive improvements made in product development, forecasting, distribution and sourcing for these acquired operations. Such improvements have resulted in significantly reducing the exposure to obsolete inventory.
(5) Represents inventory values either contributed to charitable organizations or destroyed. A reserve for obsolescence was recognized as an expense in prior periods. Most of these amounts were attributed to inventories from acquired companies.
