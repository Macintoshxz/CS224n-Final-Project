FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as estimates, anticipates, projects, plans, expects, intends, believes, seeks, could, should, may and will or the negative versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used. Such statements are based upon current expectations of Cintas and speak only as of the date made. These statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this Annual Report. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs, lower sales volumes, the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions, fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs, costs and possible effects of union organizing activities, uncertainties regarding any existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation, the cost, results and timely completion of assessment and remediation of internal controls for financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the initiation or outcome of litigation, higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products, changes in federal and state tax laws and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service. Cintas undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made.
2 PART I ITEM 1.
BUSINESS Cintas Corporation, a Washington corporation, provides highly specialized services to businesses of all types throughout the United States and Canada. Cintas designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs, provides entrance mats, shop towels, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid, safety and fire protection products and services and document management services for over 700,000 businesses. Cintas was founded in 1968 by Richard T. Farmer, Chairman of the Board, when he left his familys industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric. In the early 1970s, Cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business.
Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents to its customers. Other items, including entrance mats, shop towels and restroom supplies, are also rented or sold to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to its customers as well as the sale of ancillary products and services. These ancillary products and services include first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management services and cleanroom supplies.
The primary markets served by Cintas are local in nature and highly fragmented. Competition for this business varies at each of Cintas locations. There are other companies in the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those of Cintas, although much of the competition consists of smaller local and regional firms. In certain instances, local competitors may also have financial resources comparable to those of Cintas in a particular market. Cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect these operations are product, quality, service, design and price.
Cintas serves these markets principally through the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing ongoing uniform replacements as required to each customer. Cintas also provides ancillary products and services which include the rental or sale of entrance mats, shop towels, mops, linen and restroom products and first aid, safety and fire protection products and services and document management services.
Due to its diverse customer base and average account size, the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on Cintas. No individual customer accounts for greater than one percent of Cintas total revenues.
In its sale of customized uniforms, Cintas competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers. Cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect these operations are design, service and price.
Cintas operates fourteen manufacturing facilities, which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs. Additional products are purchased from numerous outside suppliers. Because of Cintas ability to manufacture much of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not have a significant impact on Cintas. Cintas purchases fabric, used in its manufacturing process, from several suppliers. Cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials.
Cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the industry. While environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs, Cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs, primarily for water treatment and waste removal, on a regular basis. Environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately $14 million in fiscal 2005 and approximately $12 million in fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were $4 million in fiscal 2005 and $3 million in fiscal 2004. These expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems, which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years. Cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to sale basis and is not aware of any material non-compliance with environmental laws.
At May 31, 2005, Cintas employed approximately 30,000 employees of which approximately 450 were represented by labor unions. Since January 2003, Cintas has been the target of a corporate unionization campaign by UNITE HERE and the Teamsters unions. These unions are attempting to pressure Cintas 3 into surrendering its employees rights to a government-supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation. This is unacceptable. Cintas philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward: We believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no. This campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations. We will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees rights. Cintas considers its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory.
Cintas files annual and quarterly reports and proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The public may copy these materials at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580 Washington, D.C. 20549 and may obtain further information concerning the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains the same information regarding Cintas that is filed electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is: http://www.sec.gov. Cintas Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are posted on its website, www.cintas.com, as soon as practicable after filing with the SEC.
The following table sets forth the revenues derived from each service segment provided by Cintas.

4 ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES Cintas occupies 377 facilities located in 280 cities, of which 193 facilities are leased for various terms ranging from monthly to the year 2015. Cintas expects that it will be able to renew its leases on satisfactory terms. Of the fourteen manufacturing facilities listed below, Cintas controls the operations of four of these manufacturing plants, but does not own or lease the real estate related to these operations. All other properties are owned. The corporate offices provide centrally located administrative functions including accounting, finance, marketing and computer system development and support. Cintas operates processing plants that house administrative, sales and service personnel and the necessary equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and bulk items, such as entrance mats and shop towels. Branch operations provide administrative, sales and service functions. Cintas operates seven distribution centers and fourteen manufacturing plants. Cintas also operates first aid, safety and fire protection and document management facilities and direct sales offices. Cintas considers the facilities it operates to be adequate for their intended use. Cintas owns or leases 10,725 vehicles.

A reserve has been established for the estimated liability related to these allegations.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS STRATEGY We are North Americas leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom products and services, first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management services and cleanroom services. Our services are designed to enhance our customers images and to provide additional safety and protection in the workplace.
Our business strategy is to increase our market share of the uniform rental and sales business in North America through the sale of new uniform programs and to provide our customers with all of the products and services we offer. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers. Our long-term goal is to provide a product or service to every business in North America.
To pursue this strategy, we focus on the development of a highly talented and diverse team of employees (who we call partners)  a team that is properly trained and motivated to service our customers. We support our partners service efforts by providing superior products with distinct competitive advantages, and we embrace technological advances.
Continuous cost containment and product and process innovation are considered hallmarks of our organization. In order to sustain these efforts, we have implemented a Six Sigma effort within Cintas. Six Sigma is an analytical process that assists companies in improving quality and customer satisfaction while reducing cycle time and operating costs. We are pleased with our progress in this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this process will yield to Cintas.
We continue to leverage our size and core competencies to become a more valued business service provider to our current and future customers. We will also continue to supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions and the cultivation of new businesses.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2005 marked the 36 th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for Cintas. In addition to achieving this milestone, Cintas experienced healthy improvements in profitability, cash flow and balance sheet strength.
Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms, which it rents to its customers. Other items, including entrance mats, shop towels and restroom supplies, are also rented or sold to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers, as well as the sale of ancillary products and services. These ancillary products and services include first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management services and cleanroom supplies. These services are provided throughout the United States and Canada to businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people.
10 The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for the periods indicated: 2005 2004 2003 Revenue: Rentals 77.1 % 78.2 % 78.2 % Other services 22.9 % 21.8 % 21.8 % Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales: Rentals 54.8 % 55.5 % 55.8 % Other services 66.3 % 66.1 % 67.3 % Total cost of sales 57.5 % 57.8 % 58.3 % Gross margin: Rentals 45.2 % 44.5 % 44.2 % Other services 33.7 % 33.9 % 32.7 % Total gross margin 42.5 % 42.2 % 41.7 % Selling and administrative expenses 26.4 % 25.9 % 25.9 % Interest income -0.2 % -0.1 % -0.1 % Interest expense 0.8 % 0.9 % 1.2 % Write-off of loan receivable  0.1 %  Income before income taxes 15.5 % 15.4 % 14.7 % As evidenced above, our revenue growth has been higher in Other Services versus Rentals during fiscal 2005, resulting in a moderate shift in the percentage of revenue between our reporting segments. This shift was mainly driven by the acquisitions of first aid, safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses. Information related to acquisitions is discussed in Note 8 entitled Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Fiscal 2005 total revenue was $3.1 billion, an increase of 9.0% over fiscal 2004. Internal growth improved throughout fiscal 2005 and was 6.3% for the year. As the economy continued to strengthen and employment rates improved, our internal growth rates improved. Internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of workdays, by quarter and for the year, where applicable.
Total Company Internal Growth First Quarter Ending August 31, 2004 5.6 % Second Quarter Ending November 30, 2004 5.0 % Third Quarter Ending February 28, 2005 7.1 % Fourth Quarter Ending May 31, 2005 7.5 % For the Year Ending May 31, 2005 6.3 % Historically, increases in our internal growth rate have lagged an economic upturn as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs. Our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base. The remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid, safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses. Information related to acquisitions is discussed in Note 8 entitled Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
11 Rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental and/or sale of corporate identity uniforms, mats, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Rentals segment increased 7.4% over fiscal 2004. Internal revenue growth for the Rentals segment was 6.8% in fiscal 2005 compared to 4.2% in fiscal 2004. The 0.6% of remaining growth in fiscal 2005 resulted from the acquisition of rental volume.
The increase in Rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base. New business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers. We also continued to expand our rental market, with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs. Rentals revenue growth was partially offset by lost business of approximately 7.0%.
Other Services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services. Other direct sale products and services include cleanroom supplies, first aid, safety and fire protection products and services and document management services. Other Services revenue increased 14.9% over fiscal 2004, primarily due to acquisitions of first aid, safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses.
Internal revenue growth in the Other Services segment was 4.4% for the year. This increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of first aid, safety and fire protection products and services and document management services. Growth in these areas continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of additional products and services into our existing customer base.
Cost of rentals increased 6.0% over fiscal 2004. Cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other rental items. The cost increase over fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by the growth in Rentals segment revenues. Rising oil and fuel costs also contributed to this increase. Various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year provided a decrease in cost of rentals as a percent to Rentals revenue from 55.5% in fiscal 2004 to 54.8% in fiscal 2005.
Cost of other services increased 15.2% over fiscal 2004. Cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses. The increase over fiscal 2004 was due to the growth in Other Services revenue, derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Gross margin within this segment generally fluctuates between 30% to 35%, depending on the type of product or service sold. Products which require additional services generate higher gross margins. The gross margin for fiscal 2005 is 33.7%, which is in the upper portion of that general range, mainly due to a shift in the product mix.
Selling and administrative expenses increased 11.4% over fiscal 2004. Selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses. In order to accelerate revenue growth, we have increased our sales force, marketing plans and sales promotions. These measures combined to increase our selling costs by approximately $36 million over the prior fiscal year. The cost of providing medical benefits to our employees also increased approximately $15 million. The costs of providing medical benefits are anticipated to continue to rise.
Net interest expense decreased $5 million from the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily a result of increased interest income due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities throughout the entire year and an increase in the interest rate environment.
Pre-tax income was $477 million, a 10.4% increase over fiscal 2004. Pre-tax income from the Rentals segment increased 9.2% over the prior year due to higher rental revenue and various cost containment initiatives, which more than offset the increases in selling expenses and medical costs. Pre-tax income for the Other Services segment decreased 1.4% from the prior year mainly due to increased selling expenses and medical costs.
Cintas effective tax rate was 37.0% for both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 (see also Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Outlook section below).
Net income for fiscal 2005 of $301 million was a 10.4% increase over fiscal 2004 and diluted earnings per share of $1.74 was a 10.1% increase over fiscal 2004, both of which are consistent with the increases in pre-tax income. Return on average equity was approximately 15% in both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders equity.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $55 million in fiscal 2005, or 21.7%, primarily due to increased revenues. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions, capital 12 expenditures, expansion and possible stock repurchases. Marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities.
Accounts receivable increased $41 million due to increased revenues. Accounts receivable also increased due to a loan to an affiliated company. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Board of Directors approved and Cintas provided a $10 million loan to an affiliated company with specific repayment terms over the next three years. This affiliated company manufactures a significant portion of Cintas mats. A dividend of $5 million was subsequently received by Cintas from this affiliate in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Inventories increased $28 million mainly due to increased revenues. Other contributing factors include the continued increase in international sourcing of product, a current conversion of our comfort pant to a new fabric and style, and additional inventory requirements for our Uniform Book, a large catalog used for the direct sale of uniforms and accessories.
Net property and equipment increased by $32 million due to continued investment in rental facilities and equipment and real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of first aid, safety and fire protection and document management businesses. Capital expenditures exceeded depreciation expense by $21 million. During the year, Cintas completed construction of five new uniform rental facilities and has an additional three uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations.
Total debt decreased $12 million through repayment of certain debt, net of the change in fair market value of the debt (see Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 Fiscal 2004 total revenue was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4.7% over fiscal 2003. This growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed for much of the year. Internal growth for fiscal 2004, when adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, was 3.0%. Weakness in employment numbers through the first half of our fiscal year directly affected our business, mainly through reduced uniform wearers and usage of related products, and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective. As employment numbers strengthened over the second half of the year, our internal growth rates improved. Internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of workdays, by quarter and for the year, where applicable.
Total Company Internal Growth First Quarter Ending August 31, 2003 1.1 % Second Quarter Ending November 30, 2003 2.3 % Third Quarter Ending February 29, 2004 3.7 % Fourth Quarter Ending May 31, 2004 5.0 % For the Year Ending May 31, 2004 3.0 % Historically, increases in our internal growth rate have lagged an economic upturn as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs. Our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base.
The remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid and safety service businesses and document management businesses. Information related to acquisitions is discussed in Note 8 entitled Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental and/or sale of corporate identity uniforms, mats, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Rentals segment increased 4.3%, when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Internal revenue growth for the Rentals segment was 4.2%, adjusted for the additional workday. The amount of acquired rental volume was insignificant for the year ending May 31, 2004.
The increase in Rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base. New business remained healthy as we experienced continued 13 success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers. We continue to expand our rental market, with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs. Rentals revenue growth was mitigated by lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the sluggish economy, especially during the first half of the year.
Other Services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services. Other direct sale products and services include cleanroom supplies, first aid and safety products and services and document management services. Other Services revenue increased 4.4%, when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, primarily due to acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses.
Internal revenue in the Other Services segment, adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004, decreased by 1.3% for the year. This decrease was mainly due to the continued difficulty experienced by our uniform direct sale customers in the hospitality and airline industries. Weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers have continued to impact our direct sales effort. Partially offsetting this internal revenue decrease in uniform direct sale revenues were increased revenues from the sale of first aid products and services and document management services.
Cost of rentals increased 4.2% over fiscal 2003. Cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms and other rental items. The cost increase over fiscal 2003 was primarily driven by the growth in Rentals segment revenues. An increase in fuel and energy costs and a rise in labor delivery costs also contributed to this increase. Further assimilation of operations obtained through the Omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year mitigated the increased fuel, energy and delivery costs.
Cost of other services increased 2.8% over fiscal 2003. Cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses. The increase over fiscal 2003 was due to the growth in Other Services revenue, derived predominantly through acquisitions. The increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage, thereby providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services revenue from 67.3% in fiscal 2003 to 66.1% in fiscal 2004. Sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies and other cost containment initiatives, including Six Sigma initiatives, implemented throughout the year supported this reduction in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services revenue.
Selling and administrative expenses increased 4.6% over fiscal 2003, primarily due to increased revenues. The continued rise in medical costs and increased legal expenses contributed to the increase.
Net interest expense decreased $6 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily a result of lower debt outstanding. Total outstanding debt decreased $79 million from May 31, 2003 to May 31, 2004, as cash from operations was used to reduce debt which had been incurred predominantly during the acquisition of Omni in May 2002 (see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below and Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
A write-off of a loan receivable from a garment manufacturer is included in net income as a pre-tax charge of $4.3 million. Due to developments concerning the suppliers viability to remain as a going concern, the collectibility of the receivable was doubtful. As such, the receivable was completely written off.
Pre-tax income was $432 million, a 9.2% increase over fiscal 2003. Pre-tax income from the Rentals segment increased 6.7% over the prior year due to higher rental revenue, increased efficiencies obtained from the assimilation of operations obtained from the Omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives. Pre-tax income for the Other Services segment increased 19.6% from the prior year, due to increased sales volume, the continued leveraging of fixed costs and sourcing and cost containment initiatives.
Cintas effective tax rate was 37.0% for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 (see also Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Net income for fiscal 2004 of $272 million was a 9.2% increase over fiscal 2003 and diluted earnings per share of $1.58 was a 9.0% increase over fiscal 2003. Return on average equity was 15.4% in fiscal 2004 and 16.2% in fiscal 2003. Return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders equity.
14 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $197 million in fiscal 2004, or 341.1%, primarily due to increased revenues, a reduction in inventory levels and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in uniform and other rental items in service levels. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions, capital expenditures and expansion. Marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities.
Accounts receivable increased $7 million due to increased revenues. Aggressive collection efforts provided for a lower sequential increase in accounts receivable as compared to total revenue growth.
Inventories decreased $43 million due to improved processes and management systems, including cycle time reductions and other process improvements initiated primarily through our Six Sigma process. The completion of the Omni product line consolidation also contributed to this decrease in inventory levels.
Net property and equipment increased by $8 million due to real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses. Depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures by $4 million as Cintas continued to consolidate operations obtained from the Omni acquisition in May of 2002. In addition, due to excess plant capacity and a sluggish economy, Cintas slowed the pace of new plant construction. During the year, Cintas completed construction of four new uniform rental facilities and has an additional eight uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations.
Total debt decreased $79 million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of Omni, net of the change in fair market value of the debt (see Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At May 31, 2005, Cintas had $309 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, representing an increase of $55 million from May 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to increased net income. Cash generated from operations was $414 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to $510 million generated in fiscal 2004. This $96 million decrease was primarily due to increased accounts receivable and inventory levels. Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2005 were capital expenditures of $141 million, acquisitions of $109 million (net of cash acquired), common stock repurchases of $58 million and dividends of $55 million.
Cintas investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative. Preservation of principal, while earning an attractive yield, is the criteria used in making investment decisions.
Working capital increased $102 million to $810 million in fiscal 2005. This increase is primarily the result of increased cash and marketable securities and accounts receivable.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 totaled $141 million, including $118 million for the Rentals segment and $23 million for Other Services. Cintas continues to reinvest in land, buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth. Cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 will be between $150 and $170 million.
On May 13, 2002, Cintas completed the acquisition of Omni Services, Inc. This acquisition, coupled with smaller acquisitions in both the Rentals and Other Services segments, was financed with a combination of cash, long-term notes and commercial paper. As a result of this additional debt, the total debt to total capitalization ratio was 33.6% at May 31, 2002. Significant debt repayments have occurred since that time, including $11 million in fiscal 2005 and $69 million in fiscal 2004. The total debt to total capitalization ratio has decreased to 18.3% at May 31, 2005.
The long-term notes total $500 million and consist of $225 million with five-year maturities at a rate of 5.125% and $225 million with ten-year maturities at a rate of 6.0%. Cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of A from Standard & Poors and A2 from Moodys. Cintas also utilizes a $300 million commercial paper program, on which it has earned credit ratings of A-1 from Standard & Poors and Prime-1 from Moodys. According to Standard & Poors and Moodys, these ratings reflect Cintas commitment to conservative financial policies, strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions. The commercial paper program is fully supported by a long-term credit facility that matures in 2009. As of May 31, 2005, there is no commercial paper outstanding. Subsequent to May 31, 2005, Cintas borrowed $64 million under the $300 million commercial paper program for short-term cash requirements. This financing decision was made in order to allow certain marketable securities to reach maturity rather than Cintas incurring a penalty for early redemption.
During the year, Cintas paid dividends of $55 million, or $0.32 per share. On a per share basis, this dividend is an increase of 10.3% over the dividend paid in fiscal 2004. This marks the 22 nd consecutive year that Cintas has increased 15 its annual dividend since going public in 1983.
On May 2, 2005, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million stock repurchase program at market prices. During fiscal 2005, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Cintas stock at an average price of $39.62 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $58 million. Due to the stock being purchased late in fiscal 2005, the amount of purchased shares did not change fiscal 2005 earnings per share. Subsequent to May 31, 2005, Cintas purchased approximately 2.4 million additional shares of Cintas stock at an average price of $39.08 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $96 million. As such, from the inception of the stock repurchase program through July 22, 2005, Cintas has purchased approximately 3.9 million shares of Cintas stock at an average price of $39.27 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $154 million. The Board did not specify an expiration date for this program.
Following is information regarding Cintas long-term contractual obligations and other commitments outstanding as of May 31, 2005: LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Payments Due by Period Two to One year three Four to After five (In thousands) Total or less years five years years Long-term debt (1) $ 469,668 $ 6,731 $ 232,033 $ 872 $ 230,032 Capital lease obligations (2) 2,923 569 1,213 661 480 Operating leases (3) 61,814 18,572 25,819 10,863 6,560 Interest payments (4) 125,345 26,225 43,147 27,708 28,265 Interest swap agreements (5) (1,719 ) (101 ) (1,618 )   Unconditional purchase obligations      Total contractual cash obligations $ 658,031 $ 51,996 $ 300,594 $ 40,104 $ 265,337 Cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans. The amounts of contributions made to the plans are made at the discretion of Cintas. Future contributions are expected to increase 15% annually. Assuming this 15% increase, payments due in one year or less would be $29,397, two to three years would be $72,685 and four to five years would be $96,126. Payments for years thereafter are expected to continue increasing by 15% each year.
(1) Long-term debt primarily consists of $450,000 in long-term notes related to the Omni acquisition. Reference Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of long-term debt.
(2) Capital lease obligations are included in long-term debt detailed in Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3) Operating leases consist primarily of building leases and synthetic leases on two corporate jets.
(4) Interest payments include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt. Rates have been assumed to increase 100 basis points for fiscal 2006, an additional 50 basis points in fiscal 2007 and then remain constant in future years.
(5) Reference Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of interest swap agreements.
OTHER COMMITMENTS Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Two to One year three Four to After five (In thousands) Total or less years five years Years Lines of credit (1) $ 300,000 $  $  $ 300,000 $  Standby letters of credit (2) 43,662 43,662    Guarantees      Standby repurchase obligations      Other commercial commitments      Total commercial commitments $ 343,662 $ 43,662 $  $ 300,000 $  (1) Back-up facility for the commercial paper program (reference Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).
16 (2) Support certain outstanding debt (reference Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), self-insured workers compensation and general liability insurance programs.
Cintas has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the synthetic leases on two corporate jets. The synthetic leases on the aircraft do not currently have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on Cintas financial condition, changes in Cintas financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Changes in wages, benefits and oil and fuel costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas financial results. Medical benefits and oil and fuel costs, in particular, continue to rise. Medical benefit costs have increased due to a combination of rising healthcare costs and an increase in the number of covered participants. Medical benefits were 3.1% of total revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2.9% of total revenues in fiscal 2004. Oil and fuel costs were 2.8% of total revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2.5% of total revenues in fiscal 2004.
Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas financial condition or a negative impact on operations.
LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of Cintas. Cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation discussed below.
Cintas is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, Paul Veliz, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , filed on March 19, 2003, in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, Oakland Division, alleging that Cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service sales representatives, whom Cintas considers exempt employees, and asserting additional related ERISA claims. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief or both. Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs allegations. The court ordered arbitration for all potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of four narrowly defined exceptions. As a result, Cintas believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be required to arbitrate their claims. No determination has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class certification. There can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class. If a court or arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.
Cintas is also a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, Robert Ramirez, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , filed on January 20, 2004, and pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. The case was brought on behalf of all past and present female, African-American and Hispanic employees of Cintas and its subsidiaries. The complaint alleges that Cintas has engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment, hiring, promotions, transfers, job assignments and pay. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys fees, among other things. Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs allegations. The court ordered arbitration as to three of the ten named plaintiffs. On April 27, 2005, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a motion to intervene in order to participate in this lawsuit. No filings or determination has been made in regard to the lawsuit as to class certification. There can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class. Several related proceedings with similar allegations and seeking similar relief damages and fees are pending, including an EEOC charge filed on April 17, 2000, by Mirna Serrano with the EEOC Detroit District office on behalf of female service sales representative job applicants at all Cintas locations in Michigan, a class action lawsuit, Mirna E. Serrano, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , filed on May 10, 2004, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division on behalf of the same female service sales representative job applicants in the EEOC charge, and an administrative action filed on December 15, 2004, by James Morgan with the EEOC Washington, D.C. office and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging racial discrimination in compensation and training opportunities. In addition, a class action lawsuit, Larry Houston, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , was filed on August3, 2005, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of African-American managers alleging racial discrimination. If there is an adverse verdict or a negotiated settlement of these actions, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to these proceedings is not determinable at this time.
17 Several other similar administrative proceedings are pending including: (i) two charges filed on November 30, 2004, by an EEOC Commissioner with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging failure to hire and assign females to production job positions, and, failing to hire females, African-Americans and Hispanics into the Management Trainee program, (ii) a charge filed on January 24, 2005, by Jennifer Fargo on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the Augusta Human Relations Commission and the EEOC Detroit District office alleging gender and equal pay discrimination against female sales representatives and sales associates, (iii) a charge filed on March 23, 2005, by Clifton Cooper on behalf of himself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race, (iv) a charge filed on March 28, 2005, by Lorelei Reynolds on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Birmingham District alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and gender, (v) a charge filed on April 25, 2005, by Melissa Schulz on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit and the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, Civil Rights Division alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and gender, (vi) a charge filed on May 6, 2005, by Anthony Jones on behalf of himself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and (vii) a charge filed on June 10, 2005, by Mattie Cooper on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and gender. The investigations of these allegations are pending and no determinations have been made.
Cintas is also a defendant in a lawsuit, J. Lester Alexander, III vs. Cintas Corp., et al ., which was originally filed on October 25, 2004, and is currently pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Eastern Division. The case was brought by J. Lester Alexander, III, the Chapter 7 Trustee (the Trustee) of Terry Manufacturing Company, Inc. (TMC) and Terry Uniform Company, LLC (TUC), against Cintas in Randolph County, Alabama. The Trustee seeks damages against Cintas for allegedly breaching fiduciary duties to TMC and TUC and for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by others to those entities. The complaint also includes allegations that Cintas breached certain limited liability company agreements, or alternatively, misrepresented their intention to perform their obligations in those agreements and acted as alter egos of the bankrupt TMC and are therefore liable for all of TMCs debts. The Trustee is seeking $50 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages. Cintas denies these claims and is vigorously defending itself against all claims in the complaint. If there is an adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of this lawsuit, the resulting liability could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.
During fiscal 2001, the State of Connecticut filed suit against Cintas in the Superior Court District of Hartford alleging various violations of state environmental laws and alleging that Cintas violated certain wastewater discharge and hazardous waste violations. While this proceeding is not considered material to the business or financial condition of the registrant, management reasonably believes that the proceedings will result in monetary sanctions in excess of $100 thousand. A reserve has been established for the estimated liability related to these allegations.
The litigation discussed above, if decided adversely to or settled by Cintas, may, individually or in the aggregate, result in liability material to Cintas financial condition or results of operations. Cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of Cintas shareholders.
Cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the industry. While environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs, Cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs, primarily for water treatment and waste removal, on a regular basis. Environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately $14 million in fiscal 2005 and approximately $12 million in fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were $4 million in fiscal 2005 and $3 million in fiscal 2004. These expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems, which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years. Cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to sale basis and is not aware of any material non-compliance with environmental laws.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , (Statement 123R) which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . Generally, the approach in Statement 123R is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The new standard will be effective for public entities (excluding small business issuers) no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Cintas will adopt this Statement no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Cintas is in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of this Statement will have on its financial position and results of operations.
18 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of Cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements.
Revenue recognition Rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized either when services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. Cintas establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts. This allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility. An uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages. The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the Rentals and Other Services segments, because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Substantially all inventories represent finished goods. Cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances. The judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market. Inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence.
Uniforms and other rental items in service Uniform and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments) are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months. Other rental items including shop towels, mats, cleanroom garments, flame resistant garments, linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to forty-eight months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements.
Property and equipment Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings, five to twenty years for building improvements, three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts. Fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. Long-lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less estimated costs related to disposition.
Goodwill and impairment Goodwill, primarily obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas performs annual impairment tests by segment. These tests include comparisons to current market values, where available, and discounted cash flow analyses. Significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth. Based on the results of the impairment tests, Cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended May 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Service contracts and other assets Service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally five to ten years. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models 19 involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification. No impairment has been recognized by Cintas for the years ended May 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Environmental matters and related litigation Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. Cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements. A detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled Litigation and Other Contingencies.
Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Please reference Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. As a result of this review, Cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.
Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves for probable exposures. Based on Cintas evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures.
OUTLOOK As we look forward to fiscal 2006, our outlook remains positive, but guarded. As the economy has strengthened and employment rates have improved, our internal growth rates have also continued to improve. Based on our marketing data, we have a relatively low 7% market share of a $42.5 billion estimated potential market. As such, we see upside potential for all of our business units. Although difficult to predict, we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units. Overall performance will be largely driven by external market conditions.
In the marketplace, competition and related pricing pressure will continue; however, we believe cost containment initiatives, technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact.
When appropriate opportunities arise, we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions.
Like most other companies, we experienced, and anticipate continuing to experience, increased costs for wages and benefits, including medical benefits. Changes in oil and fuel costs and changes in federal and state tax laws also have the potential to impact our results.
Cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by UNITE HERE and the Teamsters unions. These unions are attempting to pressure Cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a government-supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation. This is unacceptable. Cintas philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward: We believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no. This campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations. We will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees rights.
We believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure, quality products, financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success. However, a number of factors influence future revenue, margins and profit which make forecasting difficult.
20 ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt, marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements. Earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately $230 million, with an average interest rate of 4.6%. This exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in short-term rates. If short-term rates change by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas income before taxes would change by approximately $1 million. This estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas capital structure.
Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar. Cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Audited   Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ended May 31, 2005, 2004 and   2003 Managements   Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Reports of   Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Consolidated   Statements of Income Consolidated   Balance Sheets Consolidated   Statements of Shareholders Equity Consolidated   Statements of Cash Flows Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 22 Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting To the Shareholders of Cintas Corporation: Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
With the supervision of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2005. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Managements assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies and our overall control environment. This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our internal audit function.
Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2005, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, audited managements assessment and independently assessed the effectiveness of Cintas internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young has issued an attestation report, which is included in this Annual Report.
/s/ Scott D. Farmer Scott D. Farmer President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ William C. Gale William C. Gale Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 23 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cintas Corporation: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, that Cintas Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Cintas Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Cintas Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Cintas Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria .
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cintas Corporation as of May 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2005 of Cintas Corporation, and our report dated July 22, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cintas Corporation at May 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Cintas Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated July 22, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

29 CINTAS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Amounts in thousands except per share and share data) 1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business description.
Cintas Corporation (Cintas) provides highly specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. Cintas designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs, provides entrance mats, shop towels, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid, safety and fire protection products and services and document management services for over 700,000 businesses.
Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms, which it rents to its customers. Other items, including entrance mats, shop towels and restroom supplies, are also rented or sold to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers, as well as the sale of ancillary products and services. These ancillary products and services include first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management services and cleanroom supplies. These services are provided throughout the United States and Canada to businesses of all types - from small service manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people.
Principles of consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cintas and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Financial results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue recognition.
Rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized either when services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. Cintas also establishes an estimate of allowances for uncollectible accounts when revenue is recorded.
Cost of rentals.
Cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other rental items. The Rentals segment inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs of distribution are included in the cost of rentals.
Cost of other services.
Cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses. The Other Services segment inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs and other costs of distribution are included in the cost of other services.
Selling and administrative expense.
Selling and administrative expense consists primarily of sales labor and commissions, management labor, payroll taxes, medical expense, insurance expense, legal costs and amortization of intangibles.
Cash and cash equivalents.
Cintas considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less, at date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.
Marketable securities.
All marketable securities are comprised of debt securities and classified as available-for-sale. The majority of these debt securities are obligations of state and political subdivisions.
Accounts receivable.
Accounts receivable are comprised of amounts owed through product shipments and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. This allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility. An uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages. The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the Rentals and Other Services segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment. When an account is considered uncollectible, it is written off against this allowance.
Inventories.
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Substantially all inventories represent finished goods.
Uniforms and other rental items in service.
These items are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments) are amortized over their useful life 30 of eighteen months. Other rental items including shop towels, mats, cleanroom garments, flame resistant garments, linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to forty-eight months.
Property and equipment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method primarily over the following estimated useful lives, in years: Buildings 30 to 40 Building improvements 5 to 20 Equipment 3 to 10 Leasehold improvements 2 to 5 Long-lived assets.
When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts. Fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. Long-lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less estimated costs related to disposition.
Goodwill.
As required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is separately disclosed from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and no longer amortized, but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Cintas completed an annual goodwill impairment test for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as required by SFAS 142. Based on the results of the impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in any of these years. Cintas will continue to perform future impairment tests as required by SFAS 142 as of March1 in future years, or when indicators of impairment are noted.
Service contracts and other assets.
Service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally five to ten years.
Accrued liabilities.
Accrued liabilities consist primarily of insurance, medical and profit sharing obligations and legal and environmental contingencies. These are recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Stock options.
Cintas applies the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been reflected in the financial statements as the exercise price of options granted to employees is equal to the fair market value of Cintas common stock on the date of grant. Cintas has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (SFAS 123), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
In December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.148 (SFAS 148), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure.
This Statement amends SFAS 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Cintas continues to apply APB 25 for the method used to account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements, where applicable, but adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 during fiscal 2003.
31 For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of Cintas stock options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period. Pro forma results as if Cintas accounted for its stock-based employee compensation using the fair value based alternative appear below: 2005 2004 2003 Net income, as reported $ 300,518 $ 272,205 $ 249,253 Deduct: Total stock-based employee   compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards,   net of related tax effects (7,971 ) (7,127 ) (6,062 ) Pro forma net income $ 292,547 $ 265,078 $ 243,191 Earnings per share: Basic  as reported $ 1.75 $ 1.59 $ 1.46 Basic  pro forma $ 1.70 $ 1.55 $ 1.43 Diluted  as reported $ 1.74 $ 1.58 $ 1.45 Diluted  pro forma $ 1.69 $ 1.54 $ 1.41 The effects of providing pro forma disclosure are not representative of earnings to be reported for future years.
During fiscal 2005, Cintas vested certain employee stock options whose exercise price was greater than current market value. This vesting will have an impact on basic pro forma and diluted pro forma earnings per share in future years.
Derivatives and hedging activities.
Derivatives and hedging activities are presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133 (SFAS 133), Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, as amended. This Standard requires the recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and recognition of the resulting gains or losses as adjustments to earnings or other comprehensive income.
Cintas formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Cintas hedging activities are transacted only with highly rated institutions, reducing the exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance.
From time to time, Cintas will use derivatives for both cash flow hedging and fair value hedging purposes. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure of variability in short-term interest rates, designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For the ineffective portion of the hedge, gains or losses are charged to earnings in the current period. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate debt, designated as fair value hedges, the effective portion of the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the fixed rate debt attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.
Cintas uses interest rate swap and lock agreements, from time to time, to hedge against variability in short-term interest rates. These agreements effectively convert a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. Cintas uses the Hypothetical Derivative Method for assessing the effectiveness of these swaps. The effectiveness of these swaps is reviewed at least every fiscal quarter. Cintas also uses reverse interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis, thus hedging for changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt being hedged. Cintas has determined that the interest rate swap agreements referenced in Note 5, entitled Long-Term Debt, designated as fair value hedges, qualify for treatment under the short-cut method of measuring effectiveness. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, these hedges are determined to be perfectly effective and there is no requirement to periodically evaluate effectiveness.
32 Fair value of financial instruments.
The following methods and assumptions were used by Cintas in estimating the fair value of financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents . The amounts reported approximate market value.
Marketable securities.
The amounts reported are at cost, which approximates market value. Market values are based on quoted market prices.
Long-term debt.
The amounts reported are at a carrying value which approximates market value. Market values are determined using similar debt instruments currently available to Cintas that are consistent with the terms, interest rates and maturities.
Reclassification.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Other accounting pronouncements . On December16, 2004, FASB issued Statement No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , (Statement 123R), which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . Generally, the approach in Statement 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, Statement 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The new standard will be effective for public entities (excluding small business issuers) no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June15, 2005. Cintas will adopt this Statement no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Cintas is in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of this Statement will have on its financial position and results of operations.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES All marketable securities are comprised of debt securities and classified as available-for-sale. Realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The cost of the securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income.
The following is a summary of marketable securities: 2005 2004 Estimated Estimated Cost Fair Value Cost Fair Value Obligations of state and political   subdivisions $ 163,168 $ 161,258 $ 134,921 $ 133,888 U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of   U.S. government agencies 55,143 54,583 112 109 Other debt securities 47,921 47,846 31,931 31,799 $ 266,232 $ 263,687 $ 166,964 $ 165,796 The gross realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $23, $19 and $105 for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the gross realized losses totaled $19, $0 and $10, respectively. Net unrealized losses are $2,545 and $1,168 at May31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at May31, 2005, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay the obligations without prepayment penalties.
Estimated Cost Fair Value Due in one year or less $ 77,809 $ 77,576 Due after one year through three years 188,423 186,111 $ 266,232 $ 263,687 33 3.

GOODWILL, SERVICE CONTRACTS AND OTHER ASSETS Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and service contracts for the years ended May31, 2005 and 2004, by operating segment, are as follows: Other Rentals Services Total Goodwill Balance as of June1, 2003 $ 671,955 $ 49,900 $ 721,855 Goodwill acquired 13,269 70,260 83,529 Foreign currency translation 37 20 57 Balance as of May31, 2004 685,261 120,180 805,441 Goodwill acquired 15,082 67,873 82,955 Foreign currency translation 1,079 63 1,142 Balance as of May31, 2005 $ 701,422 $ 188,116 $ 889,538 Other Rentals Services Total Service Contracts Balance as of June1, 2003 $ 136,118 $ 8,781 $ 144,899 Service contracts acquired 3,641 16,827 20,468 Service contracts amortization (8,161 ) (12,608 ) (20,769 ) Foreign currency translation 65 1 66 Balance as of May31, 2004 131,663 13,001 144,664 Service contracts acquired 4,473 19,423 23,896 Service contracts amortization (19,466 ) (4,204 ) (23,670 ) Foreign currency translation 1,680 26 1,706 Balance as of May31, 2005 $ 118,350 $ 28,246 $ 146,596 Information regarding Cintas service contracts and other assets follows: As of May31, 2005 Carrying Accumulated Amount Amortization Net Service contracts $ 236,179 $ 89,583 $ 146,596 Noncompete and consulting agreements $ 36,158 $ 17,163 $ 18,995 Other 23,671 2,798 20,873 Total $ 59,829 $ 19,961 $ 39,868 34 As of May31, 2004 Carrying Accumulated Amount Amortization Net Service contracts $ 216,997 $ 72,333 $ 144,664 Noncompete and consulting agreements $ 33,720 $ 19,665 $ 14,055 Other 29,100 2,516 26,584 Total $ 62,820 $ 22,181 $ 40,639 Amortization expense was $28,362, $25,974 and $27,741 for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Estimated amortization expense, excluding any future acquisitions, for each of the next five years is $28,845, $27,001, $24,582, $22,118 and $18,977, respectively.

LONG-TERM DEBT 2005 2004 Unsecured term notes due through 2017 at an   average rate of 5.35% $ 456,640 $ 464,368 Unsecured notes due through 2009 at an average   rate of 7.11% 8,594 11,489 Industrial development revenue bonds due through   2015 at an average rate of 3.67% 4,434 4,884 Other 2,923 3,467 472,591 484,208 Less: amounts due within one year 7,300 10,523 $ 465,291 $ 473,685 Debt in the amount of $7,357 is secured by assets with a carrying value of $8,475 at May31, 2005. Cintas has letters of credit outstanding at May31, 2005, approximating $43,662. Maturities of long-term debt during each of the next five years are $7,300, $4,287, $228,959, $990 and $543, respectively.
Interest expense is net of capitalized interest of $749, $521 and $186 for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest paid, net of amount capitalized, was $23,163, $25,825 and $20,766 for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Cintas has a commercial paper program supported by a $300 million long-term credit facility. As of May31, 2005, there is no commercial paper outstanding.
From time to time, Cintas uses interest rate swap and lock agreements as hedges against variability in short-term interest rates. These agreements effectively convert a portion of floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. Cintas uses the Hypothetical Derivative Method for assessing the effectiveness of these swaps. There were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of May31, 2005. When outstanding, the effectiveness of these swaps is reviewed at least every fiscal quarter. Cintas also uses reverse interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis, thus hedging for changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt being hedged. These agreements involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of underlying principal amount. The mark-to-market values of both the fair value hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are equal and recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings. Cintas has determined that the current interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, qualify for treatment under the short-cut method of measuring effectiveness. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, these hedges are determined to be perfectly effective and there is no requirement to periodically evaluate effectiveness.
Cintas entered into two lock agreements as part of the Omni acquisition in fiscal 2002. The amortization of the cash flow hedge, pertaining to these lock agreements, and the change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge, pertaining to the interest rate swap agreements, resulted in a credit to other comprehensive income of $290 and $669 for the years ended May31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The reverse interest rate swap agreements are fair value hedges that convert $225 million of fixed rate debt to a floating rate. These agreements expire in 2007 and allow Cintas to receive an effective 35 interest rate of 5.13% and pay an interest rate based on LIBOR. Because these fair value hedges are 100% effective, the net $4 million unfavorable change for fiscal 2005 and the net $10 million unfavorable change for fiscal 2004 were directly offset by a decrease in the fair value of the debt, reflecting increased floating interest rates over the prior fiscal years.
Cintas has certain significant covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios. Cross default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. Cintas is in compliance with all of the significant debt covenants for all periods presented. Were a default of a significant covenant to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas debt, net of cash and marketable securities, is $163 million. For fiscal 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $414 million. Capital expenditures were approximately $141 million for the same period.
6.
LEASES Cintas conducts certain operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment. Most leases contain renewal options for periods from one to ten years. The lease agreements provide for increases in rentals if the options are exercised based on increases in certain price level factors or other prearranged factors. Step rent provisions, escalation clauses, capital improvements funding and other lease concessions are taken into account in computing minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. Lease payments are not dependent on an existing index or rate and are not included in minimum lease payments. It is anticipated that expiring leases will be renewed or replaced.
The minimum rental payments under noncancelable lease arrangements for each of the next five years and thereafter are $18,572, $14,638, $11,181, $7,412, $3,451 and $6,560, respectively. Rent expense under operating leases during the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $25,280, $22,675 and $25,083, respectively.
7.
INCOME TAXES 2005 2004 2003 Earnings before income taxes consist of the   following components: U.S. operations $ 447,965 $ 411,091 $ 384,288 Foreign operations 29,028 20,989 11,471 $ 476,993 $ 432,080 $ 395,759 2005 2004 2003 Income taxes consist of the following   components: Current: Federal $ 155,987 $ 132,105 $ 128,198 State and local 18,043 12,291 13,136 174,030 144,396 141,334 Deferred 2,445 15,479 5,172 $ 176,475 $ 159,875 $ 146,506 2005 2004 2003 Reconciliation of income tax expense using   the statutory rate and actual income tax expense is as follows: Income taxes at the U.S. federal statutory   rate $ 166,947 $ 151,228 $ 138,515 State and local income taxes, net of   federal benefit 12,050 8,939 9,160 Other (2,522 ) (292 ) (1,169 ) $ 176,475 $ 159,875 $ 146,506 36 The components of deferred income taxes included on the balance sheets are as follows: 2005 2004 Deferred tax assets: Employee benefits $ 4,462 $ 1,964 Allowance for bad debts 3,357 2,883 Inventory obsolescence 11,238 11,266 Insurance and contingencies 10,222 10,250 Other 9,532 7,348 38,811 33,711 Deferred tax liabilities: In service inventory 82,883 83,840 Property 87,491 81,768 Intangibles 30,296 27,205 State taxes 13,861 10,897 214,531 203,710 Net deferred tax liability $ 175,720 $ 169,999 Income taxes paid were $151,243, $118,125 and $139,794 for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions by providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. Cintas has reviewed this provision and determined that no foreign earnings will be repatriated under the Act.
U.S. income taxes of $3,119, net of foreign tax credits, have not been provided for on a cumulative total of approximately $70,323 of undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries as of May31, 2005. Cintas intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United States.
8.
ACQUISITIONS For all acquisitions accounted for as purchases, including insignificant acquisitions, the purchase price paid for each has been allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During fiscal 2005, Cintas acquired 10 Rentals businesses and 27 Other Services businesses. During fiscal 2004, Cintas acquired 8 Rentals businesses and 29 Other Services businesses. The following summarizes the aggregate purchase price for all businesses acquired: 2005 2004 Fair value of tangible assets acquired $ 18,811 $ 25,642 Fair value of goodwill acquired 81,245 83,194 Fair value of service contracts acquired 24,008 20,457 Fair value of other intangibles acquired 10,082 2,554 Total fair value of assets acquired 134,146 131,847 Fair value of liabilities assumed and   incurred 12,219 18,535 Total cash paid for acquisitions $ 121,927 $ 113,312 The results of operations for the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition. The pro forma revenue, net income and earnings per share information relating to acquired businesses are not presented because they are not significant.
9.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS Cintas Partners Plan is a non-contributory profit sharing plan and ESOP for the benefit of substantially all U.S. Cintas employees who have completed one year of service. The plan also includes a 401(k) savings feature covering substantially all employees. The amounts of contributions to the profit sharing plan and ESOP, as well as the matching contribution to the 401(k), are made at the discretion of Cintas. Total contributions, including Cintas matching contributions, were $24,400, $22,160 and $20,100 for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Cintas also has a non-contributory deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP), which covers substantially all Canadian employees. In addition, a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is offered to those employees. The amounts of contributions to the DPSP, as well as the matching contribution to the RRSP, are made at the discretion of Cintas. Total contributions were $897, $774 and $628 for the years ended May31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
37 10.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share are computed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.128, Earnings per Share.
The basic computations are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The diluted computations reflect the potential dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised into common stock, under certain circumstances, that then would share in the earnings of Cintas.
The following table represents a reconciliation of the shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for the respective years: 2005 2004 2003 Numerator: Net income $ 300,518 $ 272,205 $ 249,253 Denominator: Denominator for basic earnings per share    weighted average shares (000s) 171,679 170,960 170,262 Effect of dilutive securities  employee   stock options (000s) 970 1,412 1,775 Denominator for diluted earnings per share    adjusted weighted average shares and assumed conversions (000s) 172,649 172,372 172,037 Basic earnings per share $ 1.75 $ 1.59 $ 1.46 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.74 $ 1.58 $ 1.45 11.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION Under the stock option plan adopted by Cintas in fiscal 2000, Cintas may grant officers and key employees incentive stock options and/or non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of Cintas common stock. Options are granted at the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and generally vest and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year commencing five years after grant, so long as the holder remains an employee of Cintas.
The information presented in the following table relates primarily to stock options granted and outstanding under either the plan adopted in fiscal 2000 or under similar plans: Weighted Average Shares Exercise Price Outstanding May31, 2002 (674,595 shares   exercisable) 5,861,097 $ 28.31 Granted 1,226,800 40.60 Cancelled (426,967 ) 33.77 Exercised (681,697 ) 13.60 Outstanding May31, 2003 (753,916   shares exercisable) 5,979,233 32.12 Granted 1,214,800 39.73 Cancelled (650,734 ) 35.52 Exercised (606,740 ) 16.44 Outstanding May31, 2004 (811,700   shares exercisable) 5,936,559 34.90 Granted 1,509,400 42.12 Cancelled (441,186 ) 39.66 Exercised (562,888 ) 16.08 Outstanding May31, 2005 (3,086,485   shares exercisable) 6,441,885 $ 37.92 38 The following table summarizes the information related to stock options outstanding at May31, 2005: Outstanding Options Exercisable Options Average Weighted Weighted Remaining Average Average Range   of Number Option Exercise Number Exercise Exercise   Prices Outstanding Life Price Exercisable Price $12.92    38.59 1,684,339 2.94 $ 24.92 748,239 $ 21.66 38.75    41.65 1,679,075 7.74 40.31 675,425 41.63 41.72    42.06 1,692,852 7.89 42.03 432,002 41.96 42.19    53.19 1,385,619 6.34 45.38 1,230,819 45.57 $12.92    53.19 6,441,885 6.22 $ 37.92 3,086,485 $ 38.40 At May31, 2005, 4,441,875 shares of common stock are reserved for future issuance under the 2000 plan.
Pro forma information regarding earnings and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 and has been determined as if Cintas had accounted for its stock options granted subsequent to May31, 1995, under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $19.80, $18.43 and $19.43, respectively. The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2005 2004 2003 Risk free interest rate 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00 % Dividend yield .50 % .50 % .50 % Expected volatility of Cintas common stock 35 % 35 % 34 % Expected life of the option in years 9 9 9 The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are freely transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because Cintas options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in Cintas opinion, existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
During fiscal 2005, Cintas vested certain employee stock options whose exercise price was greater than current market value. This vesting will have an impact on basic pro forma and diluted pro forma earnings per share in future years.
12.
LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of Cintas. Cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation discussed below.
Cintas is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, Paul Veliz, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , filed on March19, 2003, in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, Oakland Division, alleging that Cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service sales representatives, whom Cintas considers exempt employees, and asserting additional related ERISA claims. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief or both. Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs allegations. The court ordered arbitration for all potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of four narrowly defined exceptions. As a result, Cintas believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be required to arbitrate their claims. No determination has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class certification. There can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class. If a court or arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.
39 Cintas is also a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, Robert Ramirez, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , filed on January20, 2004, and pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. The case was brought on behalf of all past and present female, African-American and Hispanic employees of Cintas and its subsidiaries. The complaint alleges that Cintas has engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment, hiring, promotions, transfers, job assignments and pay. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys fees, among other things. Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs allegations. The court ordered arbitration as to three of the ten named plaintiffs. On April27, 2005, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a motion to intervene in order to participate in this lawsuit. No filings or determination has been made in regard to the lawsuit as to class certification. There can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class. Several related proceedings with similar allegations and seeking similar relief damages and fees are pending, including an EEOC charge filed on April17, 2000, by Mirna Serrano with the EEOC Detroit District office on behalf of female service sales representative job applicants at all Cintas locations in Michigan, a class action lawsuit, Mirna E. Serrano, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , filed on May10, 2004, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division on behalf of the same female service sales representative job applicants in the EEOC charge and an administrative action filed on December15, 2004, by James Morgan with the EEOC Washington, D.C. office and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging racial discrimination in compensation and training opportunities. In addition, a class action lawsuit, Larry Houston, et al., v. Cintas Corporation , was filed on August 3, 2005, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of African-American managers alleging racial discrimination. If there is an adverse verdict or a negotiated settlement of these actions, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to these proceedings is not determinable at this time.
Several other similar administrative proceedings are pending including: (i)two charges filed on November30, 2004, by an EEOC Commissioner with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging failure to hire and assign females to production job positions, and failing to hire females, African-Americans and Hispanics into the Management Trainee program, (ii)a charge filed on January24, 2005, by Jennifer Fargo on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the Augusta Human Relations Commission and the EEOC Detroit District office alleging gender and equal pay discrimination against female sales representatives and sales associates, (iii)a charge filed on March23, 2005, by Clifton Cooper on behalf of himself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race, (iv)a charge filed on March28, 2005, by Lorelei Reynolds on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Birmingham District alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and gender, (v)a charge filed on April25, 2005, by Melissa Schulz on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit and the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, Civil Rights Division alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and gender, (vi)a charge filed on May6, 2005, by Anthony Jones on behalf of himself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and (vii)a charge filed on June10, 2005, by Mattie Cooper on behalf of herself and a similarly situated class with the EEOC Systemic Litigation Unit alleging discriminatory pay and treatment due to race and gender. The investigations of these allegations are pending and no determinations have been made.
Cintas is also a defendant in a lawsuit, J. Lester Alexander,III vs. Cintas Corp., et al ., which was originally filed on October25, 2004, and is currently pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Eastern Division. The case was brought by J. Lester Alexander,III, the Chapter 7 Trustee (the Trustee) of Terry Manufacturing Company,Inc. (TMC) and Terry Uniform Company, LLC (TUC), against Cintas in Randolph County, Alabama. The Trustee seeks damages against Cintas for allegedly breaching fiduciary duties to TMC and TUC and for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by others to those entities. The complaint also includes allegations that Cintas breached certain limited liability company agreements, or alternatively, misrepresented their intention to perform their obligations in those agreements and acted as alter egos of the bankrupt TMC and are therefore liable for all of TMCs debts. The Trustee is seeking $50 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages. Cintas denies these claims and is vigorously defending itself against all claims in the complaint. If there is an adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of this lawsuit, the resulting liability could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time.
During fiscal 2001, the State of Connecticut filed suit against Cintas in the Superior Court District of Hartford alleging various violations of state environmental laws and alleging that Cintas violated certain wastewater discharge and hazardous waste violations. While this proceeding is not considered material to the business or financial condition of the registrant, management reasonably believes that the proceedings will result in monetary sanctions in excess of $100 thousand. A reserve has been established for the estimated liability related to these allegations.
The litigation discussed above, if decided adversely to or settled by Cintas, may, individually or in the aggregate, result in liability material to Cintas financial condition or results of operations. Cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of Cintas shareholders.

SEGMENT INFORMATION Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents to its customers. Other items, including entrance mats, shop towels and restroom supplies, are also rented or sold to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers, as well as the sale of ancillary products and services. These ancillary products and services include first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management services and cleanroom supplies. These services are provided throughout the United States and Canada to businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people.
The $4,343 write-off of the loan receivable in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 has been included in the Corporate segment.
Information as to the operations of Cintas different business segments is set forth below based on the distribution of products and services offered.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to May31, 2005, Cintas purchased approximately 2.4 million additional shares of Cintas stock at an average price of $39.08 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $96 million. As such, from the inception of the stock repurchase program through July22, 2005, Cintas has purchased approximately 3.9 million shares of Cintas stock at an average price of $39.27 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $154 million. The Board did not specify an expiration date for this program.
Also subsequent to May31, 2005, Cintas borrowed $64 million under the $300 million commercial paper program for short-term cash requirements. This financing decision was made in order to allow certain marketable securities to reach maturity rather than Cintas incurring a penalty for early redemption.
