BUSINESS Cintas Corporation, a Washington corporation, provides highly specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. Cintas designs, manufactures, and implements corporate identity uniform programs, provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, and first aid and safety products for over 500,000 businesses. Cintas was founded in 1968 by Richard T. Farmer, Chairman of the Board, when he left his family's industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric. In the early 1970's, Cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business.
Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents, along with other items, to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to its customers as well as the sale of ancillary services including sanitation supplies, first aid and safety products and services and cleanroom supplies.
The rental markets served by Cintas are highly fragmented and competition for this business varies at each of Cintas' locations. There are other companies in the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those of Cintas, although much of the competition consists of smaller local and regional firms. In certain instances, local competitors may also have financial resources comparable to those of Cintas in a particular market. Cintas believes that the primary competitive factors that affect its operations are quality, service, design and price, in that order.
The service provided to the rental markets served by Cintas principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing on-going uniform replacements as required to each customer. Cintas also offers ancillary products which includes the rental or sale of entrance mats, fender covers, towels, mops, linen products and first aid and safety products and services.
Due to its diverse customer base and average account size, the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on Cintas.
In its sale of customized uniforms, Cintas competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers.
Cintas operates thirteen manufacturing facilities, which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs. Additional products are purchased from numerous outside suppliers. Because of Cintas' ability to manufacture much of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not have a significant impact on Cintas. Cintas purchases fabric, used in its manufacturing process, from several suppliers. Cintas is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials.
Cintas does not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental remediation that would have a material effect on its financial condition. Cintas is not aware of any material non-compliance with environmental laws.
At May31, 2003, Cintas employed approximately 27,700 employees of which approximately 700 were represented by labor unions. Cintas is currently the target of a corporate unionization campaign by the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees and Teamsters. These unions are attempting to pressure Cintas into surrendering our employees' rights to a government-supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation. This is unacceptable. Cintas' philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward: We believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no. This campaign could be disruptive to our business and could 3 adversely affect results of operations. We will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees' rights. Cintas considers its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory.
Cintas files annual and quarterly reports and proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The public may copy these materials at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549 and may obtain further information concerning the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains the same information regarding Cintas that is filed electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is: http://www.sec.gov. Cintas' Annual Report on Form10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q and current reports on Form8-K and amendments to those reports are posted on its website, www.cintas.com, as soon as practicable after filing with the SEC.
The following table sets forth the revenues derived from each service provided by Cintas.
Year Ended May 31 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Rentals $ 2,101,785 $ 1,753,368 $ 1,610,606 Other Services 584,800 517,684 550,094 $ 2,686,585 $ 2,271,052 $ 2,160,700 ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES Cintas occupies 323 facilities located in 251 cities, of which 134 facilities are leased for various terms ranging from monthly to the year 2019. Cintas expects that it will be able to renew its leases on satisfactory terms. All other properties are owned. The corporate offices provide centrally located administrative functions including accounting, finance, marketing and computer system development and support. Cintas operates processing plants that house administrative, sales and service personnel and the necessary equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and bulk items. Branch operations provide administrative, sales and service functions. Cintas operates seven distribution facilities and has thirteen manufacturing plants. Cintas also operates facilities that distribute first aid products. Cintas considers the facilities it operates to be adequate for their intended use. Cintas owns or leases 9,003 vehicles.
The following chart provides additional information concerning Cintas' facilities: Type of Facility # of Facilities Processing Plant 161 Branch 77 Cleanroom 11 First Aid Facility 34 Distribution Center 7 Manufacturing Facility 13 Direct Sales Office 20 Total 323 4 ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such actions will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of Cintas. Cintas maintains insurance coverage against certain liabilities that it may incur in its operations from time to time.
Upon acquiring Unitog Company in March1999, Cintas became a potentially responsible party, and thus faces the possibility of joint and several liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act in connection with alleged environmental contamination in an area near a rental facility in Tempe, Arizona. This facility, located near the South Indian Bend Wash Federal Superfund site, has been tested for soil and groundwater contamination. Soil testing at Cintas' facility detected volatile organic compounds, and Cintas promptly took steps to remediate the contamination. Groundwater testing in the area of Cintas' property has detected a very low level of volatile organic compound contamination. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March1999 issued a Record of Decision to the effect that groundwater contamination in the vicinity of Cintas' plant does not warrant remediation at this time. Instead, the low levels of groundwater contamination near Cintas' facility will be monitored and allowed to attenuate naturally. The Record of Decision requires active groundwater remediation in other parts of the site, which are believed to be unrelated to Cintas. According to the Record of Decision, the EPA estimates that the 30year net present value of costs to be incurred to remediate and monitor groundwater contamination at the site is $22million. It is possible that the EPA will attempt to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs it has incurred to date with respect to the site as well as the costs it expects to incur going forward. To date, no specific claim has been asserted against Cintas. Thus it is not possible at this time to estimate Cintas' loss exposure, if any, with respect to this matter.
As part of the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Unitog and Cintas, Cintas performed environmental testing at nine previously untested Unitog laundry facilities. The testing resulted in the discovery of soil and groundwater contamination at certain of these sites. As a result of all of the environmental matters noted above, Cintas recorded a charge to operating expense of $5million during the third quarter of fiscal 1999 to reflect its current estimate of the additional costs to be incurred relative to these sites. At May31, 2003, Cintas has an undiscounted liability of $3.5million for these environmental matters.
As part of the acquisition of Omni, Cintas performed environmental testing at ten previously untested Omni laundry facilities. The testing resulted in the discovery of soil and groundwater contamination at certain of these sites. Cintas estimated that remedial action would cost approximately $9million to clean up these sites, which Cintas accrued as a liability as of the date of the acquisition of Omni. At May31, 2003, the accrual remains at approximately $9million. Under its agreement to acquire Omni, Cintas agreed to pay for any remedial action, up to the first $5million, and the parties agreed that remedial costs of $3million would be treated as a purchase price adjustment and credited to Cintas.
Cintas is party to additional litigation, including a class action suit filed in Federal Court in the Northern District of California alleging that Cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service sales representatives, whom Cintas considers exempt employees, and asserting additional related ERISA claims. Cintas believes it has properly classified its service sales representatives as exempt employees and will vigorously defend these allegations. The estimated liability, if any, relating to these lawsuits has not been determined, but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial statements.
