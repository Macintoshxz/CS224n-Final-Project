BUSINESS  Cintas Corporation is a publicly held company, and is primarily a corporate identity uniform company which also provides ancillary services as discussed below. The Company was founded in 1968 by Richard T. Farmer, Chairman of the Board, when he left his family's industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric. In the early 1970's, Cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business.  Cintas provides a highly specialized service to businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people. The Company classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents, along with other items, to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to its customers as well as the sale of ancillary services including sanitation supplies, first aid and safety products and services and cleanroom supplies.  The rental markets served by the Company are highly fragmented and competition for this business varies at each of the Company's locations. There are other companies in the uniform rental business which have financial resources comparable to those of the Company, although much of the competition consists of smaller local and regional firms. In certain instances, local competitors may also have financial resources comparable to those of the Company in a particular market. The Company believes that the primary competitive factors that affect its operations are quality, service, design and price, in that order.  The service provided to the rental markets served by the Company principally consists of the rental and cleaning of uniforms as well as providing on-going uniform replacements as required to each customer. The Company also offers ancillary products which includes the rental or sale of entrance mats, fender covers, towels, mops, linen products and first aid and safety products and services.  Due to its diverse customer base and average account size, the loss of one account would not have a significant financial impact on the Company.  In its sale of customized uniforms, Cintas competes on a national basis with other uniform suppliers and manufacturers.  The Company operates fourteen manufacturing facilities, which provide for a substantial amount of its standard uniform needs. Additional products are purchased from several outside suppliers. Because of the Company's ability to manufacture much of its own uniform needs, the loss of one vendor would not have a significant impact on the Company. The Company purchases fabric, used in its manufacturing process, from several suppliers. The Company is not aware of any circumstances that would hinder its ability to obtain these materials.  The Company does not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental remediation that would have a material effect on its financial condition. The Company is not aware of any material non-compliance with environmental laws.  At May 31, 2000, the Company employed approximately 22,500 employees of which approximately 900 were represented by labor unions. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory.                                         -3- The table sets forth the revenues derived from each service provided by Cintas.

PROPERTIES  The Company occupies 269 facilities located in 207 cities, of which 106 facilities are leased for various terms ranging from monthly to the year 2019. The Company expects that it will be able to renew its leases on satisfactory terms. All other properties are owned. The corporate offices provide centrally located administrative functions including accounting, finance, marketing and computer system development and support. The Company operates processing plants that house administrative, sales and service personnel and the necessary equipment involved in the cleaning of uniforms and bulk items. Branch operations provide administrative, sales and service functions. Cintas operates six distribution facilities and has fourteen manufacturing plants. The Company also operates facilities that distribute first aid products. The Company considers the facilities it operates to be adequate for their intended use. The Company owns or leases 5,918 vehicles.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  In December 1992, the Company was served with an "Imminent and Substantial Endangerment and Remedial Action Order" (the "Order") by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control relating to the facility leased by the Company in San Leandro, California. The Order requires Cintas and three other allegedly responsible parties to respond to alleged soil and groundwater contamination at and around the San Leandro facility. It is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or range of loss associated with the claim. Based on information that has been made available to the Company, however, it is not believed that the matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.  In acquiring Unitog in March 1999, the Company became a potentially responsible party, and thus faces the possibility of joint and several liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) in connection with alleged environmental contamination in an area near a rental facility in Tempe, Arizona. This facility, located near the South Indian Bend Wash Federal Superfund (SIBW) site, has been tested for soil and groundwater contamination. Soil testing at the Company's facility detected volatile organic compounds, and the Company immediately took action to remediate such contamination. Groundwater testing in the area of the Company's property has detected a very low level of volatile organic compound contamination. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March 1999 issued a Record of Decision to the effect that groundwater contamination in the vicinity of the Company's plant does not warrant remediation at this time. Instead, the low levels of groundwater contamination near the Company's facility will be monitored and allowed to attenuate naturally. The Record of Decision requires active groundwater remediation in other parts of the SIBW site, which are believed to be unrelated to the Company. According to the Record of Decision, the EPA estimates that the 30 year net present value of costs to be incurred to remediate and monitor groundwater contamination at the SIBW site is $22 million. It is possible that the EPA will attempt to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs it has incurred to date with respect to the SIBW site as well as the costs it expects to incur going forward.  As part of the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Unitog Company and the Company, the Company performed environmental testing at nine previously untested Unitog laundry facilities. The testing resulted in the discovery of soil and groundwater contamination at certain of these sites.  As a result of all of the environmental matters noted above, the Company recorded a charge to operating expense of $5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 1999 to reflect its current estimate of the additional costs to be incurred relative to these sites. At May 31, 2000, the Company has an undiscounted liability of $5.2 million for environmental matters.  The Company is also a party to incidental litigation brought in the ordinary course of business, none of which individually or in the aggregate, is considered to be material to its operations or financial condition. Cintas maintains insurance coverage against certain liabilities that it may incur in its operations from time to time.
