Business Overview Agilent Technologies,Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May1999, is the world's premier measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.
We have two business segments comprised of the electronic measurement business and the bio-analytical measurement business. Our electronic measurement business focuses on the communications and electronics industries, while our bio-analytical measurement business focuses on the life sciences industry and in the environmental, chemical, food and petrochemical industries and in materials sciences. In addition to our two businesses, we conduct centralized research through Agilent Technologies Laboratories ("Agilent Labs"). Each of our businesses, including Agilent Labs, is supported by our general infrastructure organization, which provides shared services in the areas of finance, information technology, legal, workplace services and human resources.
We sell our products primarily through direct sales, but we also utilize distributors, resellers, manufacturer's representatives, telesales and electronic commerce. Of our total net revenue of $5.42billion for the fiscal year ended October31, 2007, we generated 34percent in the U.S. and 66percent outside the U.S. As of October31, 2007, we employed approximately 19,400 people worldwide. Our primary research and development and manufacturing sites are in California, Colorado, Delaware and Washington in the U.S. and in China, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.
In the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, we moved the nanopositioning products from the electronics measurement segment to more closely align with the new materials sciences business in the bio-analytical measurement segment. All segment disclosures and numbers have been recast historically.
3 Net revenue for each of our businesses for the years ended October31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was: 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Electronic Measurement $ 3,415 $ 3,302 $ 3,168 Bio-analytical Measurement 2,005 1,671 1,518 Total Segment Revenue $ 5,420 $ 4,973 $ 4,686 In August2005, the Board of Directors of Agilent approved the divestiture of both our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business. Both of these divestitures were completed during 2006. In December2005, we completed the sale of our semiconductor products business to Avago TechnologiesLtd. ("Avago") for approximately $2.6billion in cash proceeds. On June1, 2006, Agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its semiconductor test solutions business to a separate company, VerigyLtd. ("Verigy"), then a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent. In June and July2006, Verigy sold approximately 8.7million of its ordinary shares, or approximately 15percent of its outstanding shares, in an initial public offering. On October31, 2006, we distributed our remaining holding in Verigy to our stockholders.
We have reflected the semiconductor products business and the semiconductor test solutions business as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K. For further information, see Note4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business" and Note5, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business", to our consolidated financial statements.

For example, our mass spectrometer portfolio, including recently introduced liquid chromatography mass spectrometers, are used to analyze residual pesticides in food. Additionally, bioagriculture industries seek to improve crops and foods by conducting research on these organisms, as well as testing for genetically modified content, using microarray and microfluidics solutions.
Material Science Markets.
Initial investigation has identified consistency of target customers with existing Agilent customers in Pharma/Biotech markets, as well as Academic/Government markets. In both cases, the material science markets are sub-categories within the larger existing market segments, emphasizing emerging applications based on nano-materials. In addition, there is a well established presence in the semi-conductor lithography market. Specifically, providing solutions to large accounts that require precise nano-positioning information. Agilent's new Material Science Solutions Unit is chartered to explore the world of material science in existing markets and focus on new incremental market segments.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Products A key factor in all of our bio-analytical measurement target markets is the need for new products that increase customer productivity and provide high quality data that enable decision-making by our customers.
Microarray Products Since announcing the launch of our DNA microarray program for the life sciences in December1999, we have become a leading supplier of microarray solutions which we sell primarily to pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies in our for-profit markets, as well as academic and government funded organizations in our not-for-profit markets. Using our refined inkjet manufacturing process, we make highly sensitive 60-mer oligo nucleotide, or oligo, microarrays. This unique inkjet process is highly flexible and accurate, enabling the faster manufacture of high quality custom microarrays. In 2006, we expanded our line of microarrays to offer a new line of high-density arrays providing enhanced genomics solutions and enabling specific applications in the areas of comparative human genomics (CGH) and micro RNA detection.
Microfluidics Products The Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer is the first commercial microfluidics product for the analysis of a wide range of biological molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins and cells. The bioanalyzer chips 10 allow sample quality assessment to be done in a fraction of the usual time using fewer samples and reagents than traditional gel electrophoresis. We also provide related software, which enables the bioanalyzer to be used for the development and manufacture of protein-based therapeutics. The bioanalyzer is commonly used in genomics laboratories and has enabled the standardization of RNA quality measurement.
Gas Chromatography Products Agilent is the world's leading provider of gas chromatographs, both laboratory and portable models. A gas chromatograph ("GC") is used to separate any gas, liquid or solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. We continue to expand the application space for our GCs with the development of new separation columns and product enhancements. Over the last three years, Agilent has introduced updated and advanced models of all of its major gas chromatography platforms, including the launch of the 7890A Gas Chromatography which replaced the 6890A, the world's most popular Gas Chromatograph. In December2006, Agilent also purchased the chemiluminescence product line from General Electric (GE) Analytical Instruments to expand its solutions offering in the Petrochemical/Chemical and Food markets.
Liquid Chromatography Products A liquid chromatograph ("LC") or a high performance liquid chromatograph ("HPLC") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. Used when sample vaporization is not an option, LC also separates and detects compounds to determine molecular identity and quantity. Our LC instruments are modular in construction and can be configured to form instruments that perform specific analyses. Agilent's HPLC system, the Agilent 1100 Series, has sold over 60,000 systems since its introduction, and last year was replaced by its successor, the 1200 Series LC. The 1200 Series is an advanced version which enables true "fast chromatography" through both pressure and temperature control. Using our modular approach we have also expanded the market for higher pressure liquid chromatography with the introduction of a Rapid Resolution 1200 pump. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns and ongoing product enhancements. Our leading edge innovation, HPLC-Chip, is fully commercialized and expanding demand for nano LC solutions across many markets.
Mass Spectrometry Products A mass spectrometer ("MS") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical's molecular mass and on characteristic patterns of fragment masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing proteins and other biological entities that undergo transformations because it enables the understanding and characterization of their many different states. MS systems are typically used in combination with gas or liquid chromatographs. In the past three years, Agilent significantly expanded its mass spectrometry portfolio with a focus on reliability, sensitivity and ease of use. This year, we introduced enhancements to our new LC/MS platforms, the Agilent 6410 Triple Quadrapole MS and the 6510 Quadrapole-Time of Flight MS. These new platforms serve new and growing markets for Agilent. Agilent also reinforced its leadership in GC-MS and ICP-MS quadrapole mass spectrometry with new offerings.
Atomic Force Microscopy Products An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a high-resolution imaging device that can resolve features as small as an atomic lattice in the real space. It allows researchers to observe and manipulate molecular and atomic level features in a sample of interest. Today, significant government funding and private investment is being provided for research and product development of new and innovative 11 materials based on nanoscale structures and devices. Our expanding portfolio of AFM products provides customers, reliable, easy-to-use tools that facilitate research in this new world of material science.
PCR Instrumentation The acquisition of Stratagene Corporation during fiscal 2007 provided an expansion of our Life Science tools offering with the addition of tools and instrumentation for implementing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is used by scientists studying genetics to amplify or replicate a small amount of DNA to enable further analysis of the genes. Stratagene is a leader in the PCR market providing basic PCR tools and real time PCR tools, a homogeneous measurement version of PCR. This set of instrumentation, together with the reagents products and our Microarrays portfolio, enables us to provide additional capabilities and a broader set of workflow solutions to customers in the genomics marketplace.
Software and Informatics Products We provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software facilitates the regulatory-compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality control environments. In 2005, we completed the acquisitions of Scientific Software,Inc. and Silicon Genetics,Inc., expanding our portfolio of chromatography data systems and providing an entry into bioinformatics. This year the integration of these companies into Agilent has expanded our portfolio and market opportunities. With the acquisition of Stratagene Corporation we expanded our bioinformatics portfolio further through a relationship with Strand Genomics. We have also augmented our data system capabilities through the 2007 acquisition of Kalabie, a provider of an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) product.
Bioreagents Bioreagents are the primary tools used by scientists in the Life Science market to interrogate cells, genes and proteins. These bioreagent products are used to conduct a variety of experiments necessary to understand both the form and function of biological entities. The acquisition of Stratagene Corporation during fiscal 2007 provided an expansion of our Life Science tools offering with the addition of a portfolio of reagent products for Nucleic Acid Amplification QPCR (qualitative polymerase chain reaction)& QRTPCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction), Cloning, Cell Biology and other key life science applications. These reagent tools enable us to create a broad set of complete workflow solutions to meet customer needs across our Life Science markets.
Consumables and Services We also offer a broad range of consumable products, which support our LC, GC and MS technology platforms.

Our support services include maintenance, troubleshooting, repair and training for all of our chemical and bioinstrumentation analysis hardware and software products. Special service bundles have also been designed to meet the specific application needs of various industries.
12 Bio-Analytical Measurement Customers We have roughly 30,000 customers, and as of the end of fiscal 2007, no single customer represented greater than 10percent of the net revenue of the business. The bio-analytical measurement business is susceptible to seasonality in its orders and revenues primarily based on U.S. government and large pharmaceutical company budgets. The result is that our first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to deliver the strongest profits for this group. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Sales, Marketing and Support Our sales and support delivery channels are aligned by key markets. We market products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. Additionally, we are optimizing our worldwide distribution capabilities to address high-growth opportunities such as the environmental, food safety and pharmaceutical markets in the Asia-Pacific region.
We use direct sales to market our solutions to all of our pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical accounts, large- and medium-sized chemical customers and environmental accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, telesales and electronic commerce.
We deliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, telephone support and self-diagnostic services provided over the Internet. We also offer special industry-focused service bundles that are designed to meet the specific needs of hydrocarbon processing, environmental, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical customers to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Manufacturing Our manufacturing supports our diverse product range and customer-centric focus. We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. We selectively use third parties to provide manufacturing capabilities outside our core competencies, such as the manufacture of printed circuit assemblies and the delivery of shipment logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California, Texas and Delaware in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in China, Germany, Scotland and Japan. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing and so typically do not maintain a high level of inventory.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Competition The markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition. Our principal competitors in the life sciences arena include: Affymetrix,Inc., Applied BiosystemsInc., GEHealthcare, Invitrogen Corp., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Waters Corp. Our principal competitors in the chemical analysis arena include: Applied BiosystemsInc., Perkin Elmer Corp., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Varian,Inc. Our principal competitors in the material science arena include: Seiko, Veeco, Hitachi, Zeiss and Joel. Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.
13 Bio-Analytical Measurement Government Regulation The analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis business are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. Therefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, the EPA can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or we could face fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Agilent Technologies Laboratories Agilent Labs is our central research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with satellite offices in Beijing, China; Everett, Washington; Leuven, Belgium; and South Queensferry, Scotland. Agilent Labs engages primarily in two types of research: 1)applied research that leads to technology that can be transferred to our existing businesses in communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis, and 2)research that creates new businesses that are outside of our current markets but within our fields of interest. Agilent Labs also provides technology integration across our company.
Agilent Labs employs approximately 200 people. Agilent Labs' technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific fields, such as biology, bioinformatics, chemistry, computer science, distributed measurement, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, measurement software, optics, physics, physiology, semiconductor device design and signal processing.
General Infrastructure Organization We provide support to our businesses through our general infrastructure and shared services organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. These organizations are generally headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October2007, our general infrastructure and shared services organizations employed approximately 2,500 people, which includes 200 Agilent Labs employees.
The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.
Research and Development Research and development ("R&D") expenditures were $685million in 2007, $655million in 2006 and $650million in 2005, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services.
14 Backlog On October31, 2007, our unfilled orders were unchanged from last year for the electronic measurement business at approximately $750million. On October31, 2007, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately $290million, as compared to approximately $280million at October31, 2006. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to customers within nine months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.
Materials Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. Both our electronic and bio-analytical measurement businesses purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. No single supplier is material, although some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.
Environmental Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. These laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures.
Some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP has agreed to retain the 15 liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. Remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties.
In addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us with respect to that subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP's obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.
We are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are indemnifying HP for any liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.
We are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities being assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.
International Operations Our net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 66percent in fiscal 2007, 66percent in fiscal 2006 and 64percent in fiscal 2005, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Approximately 12percent of our annual revenue in each of the last three years was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.
Long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 55percent in fiscal 2007, 55percent in fiscal year 2006 and 50percent in fiscal year 2005. Approximately 16, 19 and 17percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.
Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws 16 and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment and finance receivable portfolios we hold. The U.S. and international community's response to recent terrorist activities could exacerbate these risks. For example, there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note21, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets On November28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. ("Lumileds") to Philips pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Share Purchase Agreement") dated as of August12, 2005 among Agilent, Agilent LED International, Philips Lumileds Holding B.V. and Philips. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, Agilent received $949million in cash proceeds, as well as approximately $51million in repayment of outstanding advances to Lumileds and interest due to Agilent.
In December2005, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of our semiconductor products business to Avago pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of August14, 2005 and amended November30, 2005 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Agilent received approximately $2.6billion in cash proceeds.
On October31, 2006, we distributed Agilent's equity interest in Verigy by means of a dividend to our stockholders. Prior to the distribution, on June1, 2006, Agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its semiconductor test solutions business to Verigy, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent. In June and July2006, Verigy sold approximately 8.7million of its ordinary shares, or approximately 15percent of its outstanding shares, in an initial public offering. On October31, 2006, the aggregate market value of the Verigy shares which were distributed was $840million.

19 Item 1A.
Risk Factors Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, if the Asia Pacific market does not grow as anticipated, our results could suffer. We experienced recent weakness in our Asia Pacific market, notably in Japan and particularly during the six months ended October31, 2007. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such decline could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins.
The actions that we have taken in order to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.
We have largely completed our program to transition our company to a reduced cost structure. These reductions and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost structure, could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our income to be lower than it otherwise might be and, as a result, adversely affect our stock price.
If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.
We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:  properly identify customer needs;  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;  differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings; 20  price our products competitively;  anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and  control product quality in our manufacturing process.
Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("IT") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.
Our income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.
Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an 21 upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.
Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  negative consequences from changes in tax laws;  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;  differing labor regulations;  differing protection of intellectual property;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.
We centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results. In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure.
Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly 22 technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.
The impact of consolidation of competitors in the test and measurement market is difficult to predict and may harm our business.
The test and measurement industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, in November2007, Danaher Corporation, one of our competitors, completed the acquisition of Tektronix,Inc., another of our competitors. Consolidation in the test and measurement industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.
Our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in our fiscal year 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business, and this year we completed several acquisitions, including the acquisition of Stratagene Corporation in our third fiscal quarter. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:  the retention of key employees;  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;  the retention of key customers;  the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities within those of the acquired company; and  the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company.
A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:  effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.
Future impairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. And, our inability to timely and effectively apply our systems of 23 internal controls to an acquired business could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.
Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by HP for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.
We have agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.
Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.
Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
Our businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more 24 stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
Some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.
We are subject to laws and regulations, and failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.
A number of our products from our bio-analytical measurement business are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products.
Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
While we do not believe that we infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties, there may be potentially relevant third party intellectual property rights that we are unaware of. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property 25 litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services.
We often rely on licenses of third party intellectual property that is useful for our businesses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our intellectual property portfolio, which we use in negotiating licenses and asserting counterclaims, continually changes as we review and adjust the patents and other intellectual property in the portfolio consistent with our business strategies. Accordingly, the amount of intellectual property that is available for us to use in our defense or for negotiations is continually changing and may decrease.
Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.
Our pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
We have received a Revenue Agent's Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome of this examination or any future examinations involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002 have been under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). In August2007, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR"). In the RAR, the IRS proposes to assess a net tax deficiency, after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits, for those years of approximately $405million, plus penalties of approximately $160million and interest. If the IRS were to fully prevail, our net operating loss and tax credits generated in recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result. The RAR addresses several issues. One issue, however, relating to the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates, 26 accounts for a majority of the claimed tax deficiency. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to this claim. Therefore we have not included any tax for this item in our tax provision for 2007. We have filed a formal protest and requested a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS and have opposed this claim, and most of the other claimed adjustments proposed in the RAR, vigorously. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may take several years. Based on current information, it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is in excess of the tax provisions we have recorded in connection with the proposed assessment, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.
We have restructured our World Trade financing arrangement, which has increased the cost to us of this arrangement and we may have to restructure this arrangement in the future, which may further increase the cost to us. We also may be subject to the risk that our current financing arrangements could be accelerated prior to their scheduled repayment date.
In January2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade,Inc. ("World Trade"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Original Repurchase Agreement") with Fenway Capital, LLC (the "Counterparty") pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5billion, 15,000 ClassA Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the "Purchased Securities"), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5billion. Pursuant to the Original Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase the preferred shares for 100percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January2011.
On September10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (the "Amended Repurchase Agreement") and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as the Counterparty at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation ("Merrill Lynch"). On November16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Amended Repurchase Agreement (such Amended Repurchase Agreement as amended, the "Repurchase Agreement") and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as the Counterparty at the request of Merrill Lynch. On December7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Repurchase Agreement among Agilent, Merrill and World Trade (the "Related Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Repurchase Agreement and Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the Counterparty at a rate per annum equal to either (i)the cost of funds to the Counterparty plus 20 basis points, or (ii)three-month LIBOR plus 52 basis points As provided in Related Agreement, at any time after February5, 2008, Merrill Lynch may require that World Trade accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities to a date designated by Merrill Lynch that is no earlier than 120days from the date that Merrill Lynch provides notice. Agilent may restructure the terms of this transaction or may pursue a new transaction to replace this transaction. There can be no assurances as to the timing or terms of any such restructuring or new transaction, and any such restructuring or new transaction may result in an increase in the cost of this transaction to Agilent.
27 We have issued $600million in a debt offering and entered into a credit facility and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
In October2007, we issued $600million in senior unsecured notes. In addition, in May2007, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to $300million. Although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility, we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock or expansion of our business.
Our incurrence of this debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:  increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;  requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our long-term non-convertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants under our long-term debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
We have substantial cash requirements in the United States while a majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Although cash generated in the United States covers normal operating requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as repurchases of our stock, acquisitions of third parties, and the refinancing at maturity of our $1.5billion obligation related to our World Trade financing arrangement. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through (1)the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or (2)other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.
If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since 28 we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could harm our brands and operating results.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, Section404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we assess and our auditors attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement for each fiscal year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, an important part of our growth strategy has been, and will likely continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and our business grows. Likewise, the complexity of our systems and controls may become more difficult to manage as we transform our operating structure and continue to reduce infrastructure costs. To effectively manage these changes, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in light of likely future acquisitions of companies that are not in compliance with Section404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation, or difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause it to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.

Legal Proceedings In November2001, a securities class action, Kassin v. Agilent Technologies,Inc., et al., Civil Action No.01-CV-10639, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court") against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ("IPO"), Agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the IPO. In 2003, the Court granted Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims against Agilent based on Section10 of the Securities Exchange Act, but denied Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims based on Section11 of the Securities Act. On June14, 2004, papers formalizing a settlement among the plaintiffs, Agilent and more than 200 other issuer-defendants and insurers were presented to the Court. Under the proposed settlement, plaintiffs' claims against Agilent and its directors and officers would be released, in exchange for a contingent payment (which, if made, would be paid by Agilent's insurer) and an assignment of certain potential claims. However, class certification of plaintiffs' underlying action against the underwriter defendants was a condition of the settlement. On December5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Court's order certifying such a class in several "test cases" that had been selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs. On January5, 2007, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing to the full bench of the Second Circuit. On April6, 2007, the Second Circuit issued an order denying rehearing but noted that plaintiffs are free to "seek certification of a more modest class." On June25, 2007, the Court entered an order terminating the proposed settlement between plaintiffs and the issuer defendants based on a stipulation among the parties. Plaintiffs have amended their allegations and filed amended complaints in six "test cases" (none of which involve Agilent). Discovery is proceeding in those cases. It is uncertain if or when there will be any revised or future settlement. Under our separation agreements with HP, HP agreed to indemnify us for a substantial portion of IPO-related liabilities. If the litigation against Agilent continues, Agilent believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the case vigorously. We believe the likelihood that Agilent will be required to pay any material amount is remote.
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity  Securities Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol "A". For the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, the high and low sale prices per quarter as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system for the New York Stock Exchange are as: Fiscal 2006 High Low First Quarter (ended January 31, 2006) $ 36.10 $ 31.90 Second Quarter (ended April 30, 2006) $ 39.54 $ 33.52 Third Quarter (ended July 31, 2006) $ 39.45 $ 27.47 Fourth Quarter (ended October 31, 2006) $ 35.81 $ 26.96 Fiscal 2007 High Low First Quarter (ended January 31, 2007) $ 35.69 $ 31.68 Second Quarter (ended April 30, 2007) $ 35.80 $ 30.26 Third Quarter (ended July 31, 2007) $ 40.42 $ 34.40 Fourth Quarter (ended October 31, 2007) $ 39.37 $ 31.15 As of October31, 2007, there were 48,254 stockholders of record of common stock. The closing share price for our common stock on October31, 2007, as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system for the New York Stock Exchange, was $36.85.
We have not paid any cash dividends to date, and we currently intend to retain any future income to fund the development and growth of our business and fund stock repurchases from time to time. Our management and Board of Directors continually evaluate our capitalization strategy.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "423(b) Plan"). The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 423(b) Plan are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding common stock of Agilent or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the 423(b) Plan, in no event shall the aggregate number of shares issued under the Plan exceed 75million shares. The number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights in column (a)does not include shares of common stock issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participant contributions under the 423(b) Plan totaling $31,631,591million as of October31, 2007.
(2) We issue securities under our equity compensation plans in forms other than options, warrants or rights. Under the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 1999 Stock Plan, (the "Stock Plan"), we may issue Stock Awards, including but not limited to restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance units, as defined in the Stock Plan. Under the terms of the Stock Plan, no more than 10percent of the total shares available for issuance under the Stock Plan will constitute restricted stock awards. Under the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the "1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan"), we may issue Special Compensation, as that term is defined in Section7 of the 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan.
(3) We issue securities under our equity compensation plans in forms which do not require a payment by the recipient to us at the time of exercise or vesting, including restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units. Accordingly, the weighted-average exercise price in column (b)does not take these awards into account.
STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE GRAPH The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return, assuming the investment of $100 (and the reinvestment of any dividends thereafter) for the period beginning on October31, 2002, and ending on October31, 2007, on each of: Agilent's common stock; the S&P 500 Index; and two Peer Groups. The first Peer Group is composed of companies that are members of the S&P Information Technology Index and the S&P Healthcare Index that compete in sectors related to Agilent's businesses ("Prior Peer Group"). The sectors are Electronic Equipment Manufacturers, Communications Equipment and Healthcare Equipment. These sectors were selected by Agilent. The individual 34 companies that comprise those three sectors are chosen and maintained by S&P. This is the last year that we will compare ourselves to this peer group. We are changing our peer group, see "New Peer Group", to a peer group that consists of high technology and measurement public companies in the S&P Information Technology Sector, excluding the Software and Services Groups and including the S&P Healthcare Equipment Group. Going forward, this will be the peer group against which we will compare ourselves as this aligns with the group that Agilent uses to benchmark its executives' compensation and set target pay, as well as metrics under its long-term performance program. Agilent's stock price performance shown in the following graph is not indicative of future stock price performance. The data for this performance graph was compiled for us by Standard and Poor's.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K. This report contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding trends, seasonality, cyclicality and growth in the markets we sell into, our strategic direction, our future effective tax rate and tax valuation allowance, earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, remediation activities, new product and service introductions, changes to our manufacturing processes, the use of contract manufacturers, the impact of local government regulations on our ability to pay vendors or conduct operations, our liquidity position, our ability to generate cash from continuing operations, growth in our businesses, our investments, the potential impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, our financial results, our purchase commitments, our contributions to our pension plans, the selection of discount rates and recognition of any gains or losses for our benefit plans, our cost-control activities, savings and headcount reduction recognized from our restructuring programs and the divestiture of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses, our stock repurchase program, our transition to lower-cost regions, the existence or length of an economic recovery that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Form10-K.
Overview and Executive Summary Agilent Technologies,Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company") is the world's premier measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Agilent has two primary businesses focused on the electronic measurement market and the bio-analytical measurement market. Our fiscal year end is October31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
In December2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. In 2006, we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business, VerigyLtd. ("Verigy"). The results of our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Agilent's net revenue from continuing operations in 2007 was $5,420million, an increase of 9percent in comparison to 2006. Our bio-analytical business performed very well throughout the year and net revenue in 2007 increased by 20percent in comparison to 2006. Demand for our products and services increased across every market in which our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses operate. In our electronic measurement business, net revenue in 2007 increased 3percent in comparison to 2006. The electronic measurement business saw reasonable growth in our general purpose test market and the communications test market declined slightly over last year. Growth for the electronic measurement segment was led by aerospace/defense and wireline/wireless research and development. There was a reduction in revenues in the wireless manufacturing market during the year as the industry experienced excess capacity in handset test. Agilent's total net revenue in 2006 increased 6percent in comparison to 2005.
Net income was $638million in 2007. Net income in 2006 was $3,307million, which included the income from and gain on sale of our semiconductor products business for $1,816million, the income from the discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business for $54million and a gain of $901million on the sale of our investment in Lumileds. Net income in 2005 was $327million.
38 In 2007, we generated operating cash flows of $969million and had cash and cash equivalents balance as of October31, 2007 of $1,826million. In 2006, we generated operating cash flows of $431million and had a cash and cash equivalents balance as of October31, 2006 of $2,262million.
The following significant events occurred in fiscal year 2007: In May2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300million unsecured credit facility that will expire in May, 2012. The company is not borrowing under the facility at this time, but may borrow under the facility from time to time as needs arise.
In June2007, we completed the acquisition of Stratagene Corporation previously announced in the second quarter of 2007. We paid approximately $252million cash for Stratagene, or $10.94 per share of their common stock. The results of operations for Stratagene have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
In October2007, we completed a stock repurchase program of $2.0billion of common stock. The program was originally announced in September2006 and subsequently updated during the second quarter of 2007 to enable the accelerated repurchase of the remaining amount.
In October2007, we issued $600million of 6.5% unsecured senior notes, discounted at 0.4% and due for repayment in November2017. We may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity and we would pay a redemption price equal to the greater of either 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed on the redemption date or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest would be paid up to but not including the redemption date. Upon the closing of the offering of the senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600million. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate.
Looking forward, our continued focus will be to grow revenue at a faster rate than the electronic measurement and bio-analytical markets, primarily through increasing market share, expanding our served market size with new products and channels and by complementary acquisitions. Our primary strategy is to pursue profitable growth by expanding our leadership in core/adjacent markets and seeking revenue growth opportunities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue recognition.
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the 39 price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use relative fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, whether fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. Most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome, requiring future adjustments to revenue.
Inventory valuation.
We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
Investment impairments.
We recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our publicly traded equity securities and our cost-method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Share-based compensation.
We account for share-based awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (R), Shared-Based Payment ("SFAS No.123 (R)") which was effective November1, 2005 for Agilent. Under the standard, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards granted after November1, 2005 over the vesting period of the award. For awards issued prior to November1, 2005, we recognize share-based compensation expense based on FASB Interpretation 28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an interpretation of APB Opinions No.15 and 25", which provides for accelerated expensing. Our estimate of share-based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures and related tax effects. We consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe are representative of future behavior. We estimate the stock price 40 volatility using the implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded stock options. We have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are traded and our ability to find traded options with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. A 10percent increase in our estimated volatility from 30percent to 40percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 21percent if no other factors were changed.
In the first quarter of 2007, we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 4.25years to 4.6years. In revising this estimate, we considered several factors, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees. In the first quarter of 2007, we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees, on average, exercise their options at 4.6years. In 2007, we granted restricted stock units (rather than stock options) to the majority of our employee base that received equity compensation. See Note3, "Share-Based Compensation," to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date  October31 for U.S. plans and September30 for non-U.S plans. The U.S. discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve as well as a hypothetically constructed portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. We also reviewed the movement of industry benchmarks from the prior year. The discount rate increased slightly over the prior year to 6.25percent. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds.
The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns. A one percent change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2007 would result in a $7million impact on U.S. pension expense and a $17million impact on non-U.S. pension expense.
41 The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations excluding curtailments and settlements were $57million in 2007, $81million in 2006 and $106million in 2005.
Valuation of long-lived assets.
We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2007. Based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We have also assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. Asset impairments primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell. During 2007, we incurred $1million of asset impairment charges. In addition, we recorded $7million of investment impairment charges during 2007.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. We estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses, which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We then determine the carrying value of these businesses. We exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses. We then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows. If the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets such as our property, plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.
Accounting for income taxes.
Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. Realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. During 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets will be realized. We did not conclude that any of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be similarly realized.
42 Cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence, which make it difficult for positive evidence to overcome. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was recorded in all instances. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance for these U.S. state and foreign entities until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. Profits or losses incurred in U.S. states and by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance.
We have not provided for all U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
Restructuring and Asset Impairment We initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods: the 2001 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan ("Prior Plans"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, due to the then pending divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses, we launched a new restructuring plan ("2005 Plan") to reduce our workforce and facility footprint to match a smaller organizational size. The workforce reduction portion of our plans are now substantially complete. However, charges in connection with the consolidation of excess facilities continue to be recorded due to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the date the liability for the excess facility was recorded. Payments will continue to be made related to these properties over the next four years.
In 2006 and 2007 we executed the 2005 Plan and recorded restructuring charges of $12million in 2007 and $186million in 2006. Workforce reduction expenses were $17million in 2007 and $111million in 2006. Charges relating to facility impairments and adjustments to the accrual relating to the consolidation of excess facilities accounted for the remainder of the restructuring charge.
As of October31, 2007, our accrual for pending workforce reduction costs was $1million, and the workforce reduction component of our restructuring plans is now substantially complete. Our accrual for the consolidation of excess facilities, decreased $27million from the prior year due to $22million of lease payments and a slight improvement in our assessments of potential recoveries from sub-lease tenants in some of our vacant properties which led to a net reversal of $5million.
We continue to realign our businesses to the changing economic environment, although such actions do not constitute a restructuring plan as they have been and are expected to be independent actions undertaken from time to time, as appropriate, each of which have been or are expected to be individually immaterial. Total workforce management charges of approximately $35million have been incurred in 2007 in respect of these actions, with a further charge of approximately $20million expected in 2008.
43 The restructuring accrual is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. For further details on our restructuring plans, see Note18, "Restructuring and Asset Impairment", to our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (rolling twelve month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. For example, over the last three years the U.S dollar has weakened against the Euro and the British pound and although we successfully hedged currency movements in those currencies each year, we have experienced a net increase in reported expenses in Europe as a result of currency fluctuations over this time period.
Results from Continuing Operations In the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, we moved the nanotechnology measurement business from the electronics measurement segment to the bio-analytical measurement segment to more closely align with the new materials sciences business in that segment. All historical segment numbers presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K have been recast to conform to this change in reportable segments.

Net revenue in 2006 was $4,973million, a 6percent increase over the $4,685million net revenue recorded in 2005.
44 The bio-analytical measurement segment achieved strong revenue growth for the year of 20percent with increases in both life science and chemical analysis businesses. In life science, there was sustained momentum due to the demand from biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers for the Liquid Chromatograph ("LC") and Liquid Chromatograph/Mass Spectroscopy ("LC/MS") platforms and microarrays. In chemical analysis, growth was driven by demand in all markets, and in particular petrochemical environmental and food testing solutions. Our electronic measurement business saw a 3percent revenue growth overall with an increase in general purpose test, but a modest decline in the communication test business. In the general purpose test business the aerospace/defense market increased steadily over 2006 and the semiconductor markets were flat year over year. The communications test business increased revenues in the wireless research and development market and the wireline market also increased in the year. The wireless handset test market has been weak throughout the year, but there are now signs of stability.
Services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting. Services and other revenue increased 8percent as compared to 2006.
Backlog On October31, 2007, our unfilled orders were unchanged from last year for the electronic measurement business at approximately $750million. On October31, 2007, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately $290million, as compared to approximately $280million at October31, 2006. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to customers within nine months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.

Operating margins in 2007 increased 2percentage points as compared to 2006. Research and development expenditure has risen modestly and we have tightly controlled selling, general and administrative expenses during the year. We experienced an unfavorable impact in gross and operating margins due to the comparative weakness of the U.S. dollar and Japanese Yen denominated revenues against the Euro and Malaysian Ringgit costs only partially offset by hedging gains. Operating margins in 2006 increased 5percentage points as compared to 2005 due to continued restructuring activities and tighter controls on spending.
45 Gross inventory charges were $21million in 2007, $38million in 2006 and $59million in 2005. Sales of previously reserved inventory were $5million in 2007, $14million in 2006 and $8million in 2005.
Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. We conduct five types of research and development: basic research, which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future; foundation technologies, which enables fundamental advances across all businesses; communications, which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information; life sciences, which enables next-generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes; and measurement, which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices, digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies; software, systems and solutions such as applied mathematics, knowledge management and measurement science; life sciences such as computational biology, molecular diagnostics and high-throughput measurements; and photonics, such as precision automation technology, optical switching and high-speed optical links. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20,000 products already in production, other research is on major new product releases, and yet other focused on developing new product segments for the future. Due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense.
Income from continuing operations in 2007 was $638million. Income from continuing operations in 2006 was $1,437million, which includes a gain of $901million for the sale of our investment in Lumileds, an equity investment.
At October31, 2007, our headcount, on a continuing operations basis, was approximately 19,400 compared to 18,700 in 2006 and 19,400 in 2005. The increase in workforce is predominantly due to acquisitions and business expansion offset by reductions in infrastructure headcount.
Provision for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 32 $ 91 $ 142 For the year ended October31, 2007, we recorded an income tax provision of $32million on continuing operations as compared with an income tax provision of $91million and $142million on continuing operations for the years ended October31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in jurisdictions other than the U.S. Income or losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions were offset by adjustments to their respective valuation allowances.
For 2007, the annual effective tax rate was 4.8percent on continuing operations. The 4.8percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes at an effective tax rate of zero in the U.S. (due to a release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance) and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions. The low continuing operations tax rate includes a benefit of $31million related to valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in other comprehensive income items, portions of which are 46 attributable to increases in currency translation adjustments and to increases in the value of certain stock investments. In addition, the tax rate includes benefits totaling $73million related to the resolution of primarily non-U.S. tax issues associated with the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard.
For 2006, the annual effective tax rate was 6.0percent on continuing operations. The 6.0percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes on the sale of our Lumileds joint venture at an effective tax rate of zero in the U.S. (due to the operation of the valuation allowance) and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions. In addition, the low continuing operations tax rate is a result of the $29million benefit related to the resolution of issues covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations.
For 2005, the annual effective tax rate was 42.6percent on continuing operations. This tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations. Additionally, the repatriation tax of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") caused a 7.2percent increase in the 2005 effective tax rate as during 2005 we decided to repatriate earnings on which we had not previously provided U.S. taxes.
On October22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and reported an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970million and a related tax liability of approximately $48million in our fiscal 2005 federal income tax return. For 2005, $23million of the $48million is provided for in the discontinued operations' provision for income taxes, while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations' provision for income taxes.
Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $190million, $76million and $54million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. It is anticipated that these tax holidays will benefit Agilent in a similar way in 2008.
During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.109 which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. During 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets will be realized. We did not conclude that any of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be similarly realized. Cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence under SFAS No.109 to require full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain full valuation allowances for these U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal.
47 Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002 have been under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). In August2007, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR"). In the RAR, the IRS proposes to assess a net tax deficiency, after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits, for those years of approximately $405million, plus penalties of approximately $160million and interest. If the IRS were to fully prevail, our net operating loss and tax credits generated in recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been, and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result. The RAR addresses several issues. One issue, however, relating to the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates, accounts for a majority of the claimed tax deficiency. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to this claim. Therefore we have not included any tax for this item in our tax provision for 2007. We have filed a formal protest and requested a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS and have opposed this claim, and most of the other claimed adjustments proposed in the RAR, vigorously. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may take several years. Based on current information, it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
For all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on SaleLumileds Agilent sold its interest in Lumileds on November28, 2005. Lumileds was a global joint venture between Agilent and KoninklijkePhilips Electronics N.V. ("Philips"). Lumileds manufactures high-power light emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, upon closure of the sale transaction, the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated. The purchase price paid by Philips under the Share Purchase Agreement was $949million. In addition, Lumileds repaid the $51million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November30, 2001.
Our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the 2006 gain on sale of our interest in Lumileds was $901million in 2006 and $42million in 2005.
General Infrastructure and Shared Services For Agilent overall we have decreased our infrastructure costs compared to 2006 by $115million. We have largely completed our restructuring activities and streamlined our operations. We passed these savings on to all our businesses according to usage of related services. We have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance, IT and workplace services and moved many of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions. The general infrastructure and shared services functions ended 2007 with approximately 2,500 employees, a decrease of approximately 230 employees from one year ago and a decrease of approximately 1,400 employees from two years ago. Over the past two years, general infrastructure and shared services headcount has dropped by 1,250 people in the Americas and Europe and by 150 people in Asia.

Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2007 over 2006 Change 2006 over 2005 Change 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Orders $ 3,415 $ 3,336 $ 3,184 2 % 5 % Net revenue from products $ 2,890 $ 2,797 $ 2,661 3 % 5 % Net revenue from services and other 525 505 507 4 % % Total net revenue $ 3,415 $ 3,302 $ 3,168 3 % 4 % Electronic measurement business orders grew 2percent compared to 2006. On a geographic basis, order growth in the Americas and Europe was offset by declines in Asia, most notably in Japan. Order growth in 2007 was driven by strength in aerospace/defense and general purpose markets, which was offset by declines in the wireless manufacturing and communications market. From 2005 to 2006 orders increased 5percent due to growth in our wireless communication applications, as well as in signaling applications for the aerospace/defense market.
Electronic measurement business revenues increased 3percent year-over-year in 2007. General purpose revenues, representing approximately 60percent of our electronic measurement business, grew approximately 7percent. Our general purpose revenues are made up of sales into the general purpose, computer and semiconductor, and aerospace/defense markets. Our general purpose market business continues to experience solid growth due to ongoing global economic expansion and steady consumer electronics spending. The computer and semiconductor market business was essentially flat year-over-year, while our aerospace/defense market business continued to grow due to on-going demand for signaling and communication solutions in defense-related applications, such as satellite, electronic monitoring, explosive device detection, and electronic warfare systems. Communications test revenues, representing approximately 40percent of our electronic measurement business, declined 2percent. Communications test revenues are made up of sales into the wireless test, wireline test and wireless design software markets. Wireless manufacturing test application business was down compared to 2006, offset by growth in our wireless R&D, wireline and wireless design software business. In 2006 revenue grew 4percent with a segment profile similar to 2007 in which growth in general purpose markets was offset by declines in our communications test business.
49 Looking forward, we project continued opportunities for growth in our electronic measurement business driven by on-going wireless 3G coverage and services expansion, as well as broadband and triple-play (voice/data/video) applications. We remain cautiously optimistic with regard to the aerospace/defense market's overall spending growth in the areas of signal intelligence, communications, surveillance and electronic warfare. This growth potential could be mitigated by potential slowdowns in spending on new communication technologies, government budget limitations and computer and semiconductor market investment.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the electronic measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2007 versus 2006 and 2006 versus 2005.
Years Ended October 31, 2007 over 2006 Change 2006 over 2005 Change 2007 2006 2005 Total gross margin 57.5 % 56.2 % 53.1 % 1 ppt 3 ppts Operating margin 14.0 % 13.7 % 10.5 %  3 ppts (in millions) Research and development $ 489 $ 449 $ 440 9% 2% Selling, general and administrative $ 999 $ 955 $ 908 5% 5% Income from operations $ 477 $ 453 $ 334 5% 36% Gross margins for products and services improved 1percentage point year-over-year in 2007 as margin improvements due to lower infrastructure costs, lower material costs and a functional change in corporate overhead classification were partially offset by changes in product mix. Gross margin for products and services increased 3percentage points from 2005 to 2006, a period of significant cost reductions driven by restructuring activities and overall operational improvements.
Research and development expenses increased 9percent in 2007. The year-over-year increase was driven by continued investment in new technologies and growth opportunities, incremental research and development costs from acquisitions, the unfavorable impact of currency movements and an unfavorable functional change in corporate overhead classification. Research and development costs increased 2percent in 2006 compared to 2005 as on-going investment in new technology was offset by restructuring savings.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5percent in 2007 compared to 2006 due to selective investment in support of growth initiatives, increases from acquisitions, and the unfavorable impact of currency movements.
Operating margins were essentially flat in 2007 compared to 2006 as gross margin improvements were offset by the increased investment in research and development, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margins improved 3percentage points in 2006 compared to 2005 as gross margin improvements drove the majority of the year-over-year improvement.
Income from Operations Income from operations increased by $24million in 2007 compared to 2006 on increased revenue of $113million. Gross margin improvements, cost structure reductions, and discretionary spending controls were largely offset by increased investment in acquisitions, incremental hiring in the first half of the year and the unfavorable impact of currency movements.
50 Income from operations increased $119million in 2006 compared to 2005 on a revenue increase of $134million. Restructuring through selective workforce reductions, reductions in our cost structure, improved material costs, lower inventory charges and overall operational improvements helped comparative operating results, with most of the improvement coming from better gross margins. In absolute dollars cost of sales was down 3percent from 2005 while revenue increased by 4percent over the same period.
Bio-analytical Measurement Our bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments; software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our twelve key product categories include: gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, microfluidics, microarrays, atomic force microscopy, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) instrumentation, software and informatics, and related bioreagents, consumables and services.
Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October 31, 2007 over 2006 Change 2006 over 2005 Change 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Orders $ 2,026 $ 1,739 $ 1,589 17 % 9 % Net revenue from products $ 1,615 $ 1,328 $ 1,193 22 % 11 % Net revenue from services and other 390 343 325 14 % 6 % Total net revenue $ 2,005 $ 1,671 $ 1,518 20 % 10 % Bio-analytical measurement orders and revenues continue to grow with mid-double-digit growth in our major markets, and achieving record levels in 2007. Over the past 3years, all geographies have contributed to the growth, with the highest growth rates in Asia and Europe.
Orders for the year ended in October31, 2007, grew 17percent (Stratagene contributed 2percent of this growth) when compared to 2006. We had solid growth across all geographies with the Americas up 8percent, Europe up 19percent and Asia up 15percent year-over-year. In our chemical analysis business, we continued to see strength from petrochemical, food and environmental markets. In life sciences we saw demand from pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations, and generic drug manufacturers.
Revenue for the year ended October31, 2007, grew 20percent with strong results seen across both life sciences and chemical analysis end markets. These results include the impact of the Stratagene acquisition. The addition of Stratagene's core strengths will allow us to better serve life sciences customers by tuning our mutual products to improve specific application solutions. Stratagene contributed 2percent of this growth for the year ended October31, 2007. In life sciences, we saw particular strength in pharma and biotech. In chemical analysis, our sales in the petrochemical, environmental and food safety markets performed well. Proprietary supplies saw double-digit quarterly growth with strength across both liquid chromatography ("LC") and gas chromatography ("GC") columns with applications in both the life sciences and chemical analysis businesses. Service revenues (point-of-sale and after-market) associated with our instruments was also up year-over-year by 14percent.
51 Chemical analysis orders, representing approximately 58percent of bio-analytical measurement, grew 14percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Chemical analysis continues to see good demand for petrochemical, food and environmental testing solutions. High petrochemical profits continue to drive capital investments in both instrument replacements and upgrades. In food and environmental segments, increased testing demands from new regulations enacted in Europe and Asia, particularly China and India, drove results. These regulatory changes led to strong demand for our new gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry solutions. Also new products such as the triple quadrupole ("QQQ") mass spectrometer, which sells into these segments, were well received. In addition, higher average oil prices for the year continue to drive demand for our instrumentation in the hydrocarbon processing and petrochemical industries.
Life science orders, representing approximately 42percent of bio-analytical measurement, grew 20percent for the 2007year compared to 2006 (Stratagene contributed 5percent of this growth). We saw good demand from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, contract research organizations and generic drug manufacturers. Excluding acquisitions, our academia and government accounts continued to grow modestly compared to 2006. Our recent acquisition of Stratagene will help bolster our coverage in academia and government accounts. In the U.S., National Institutes of Health ("NIH") funding appears to be flat to declining  making it difficult for suppliers of instruments and life sciences tools to grow significantly in this space. In Asia-Pacific, government investments remain strong. Investments in Japan are focused on genomics, in China the focus is on drug testing and quality, while in India investments are concentrated in BioPharma research. From a product perspective, revenue growth for this market segment was driven by continued success of our new 1200-series LC platform, particularly the rapid resolution system, high-performance LC columns, single quad-, triple quad-, quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometers, and microarrays.
Looking forward, we expect growth to continue from our newer products such as rapid resolution LC and enhanced single quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, gas chromatography mass spectrometry systems, and new product offerings from our recent acquisitions. Our strategic focus is to continue to enable customer applications and their productivity by providing industry- and customer-focused workflow solutions.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the bio-analytical measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2007 versus 2006, and 2006 versus 2005.
Years Ended October 31, 2007 over 2006 Change 2006 over 2005 Change 2007 2006 2005 Total gross margin 54.1 % 52.6 % 50.5 % 2 ppts 2 ppts Operating margin 19.0 % 15.9 % 14.7 % 3 ppts 1 ppt (in millions) Research and development $ 164 $ 157 $ 147 4% 7% Selling, general and administrative $ 540 $ 456 $ 396 18% 15% Income from operations $ 381 $ 266 $ 223 43% 19% Gross margin in 2007 from products and services increased 2percentage points compared to last year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased revenue, manufacturing overhead efficiencies, and a decrease in general infrastructure costs. Gross margins increased by 2percentage 52 points in 2006 compared with 2005 due to revenue growth, improved microarray production processes, and increased efficiencies in support delivery.
Research and development expenses in 2007 increased by 4percent compared to last year. This increase is due to continued investment in life sciences, increase in headcount from acquisitions, program spending to support our new product releases for this year, and higher general infrastructure costs. Research and development costs increased by 7percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to investment to support new product introductions, acquisition activity and Life Science businesses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2007 increased 18percent compared to last year. This is due to higher employee-related costs, incremental headcount from acquisitions, product launch expense to support new product releases, and higher general infrastructure costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 15percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to increased infrastructure costs and integration expenses to support acquisitions.
Operating margins increased by 3percentage points in 2007 compared to 2006. This is due to higher revenues and operational efficiencies offsetting the higher investments we made in research and development and selling, general, and administrative to accommodate growth. In 2006, operating margins increased 1percentage point compared to 2005, as we heavily invested in research and development and small headcount increases in selling, general, and administrative to support growth.
Income from Operations Income from operations increased 43percent in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher revenues and operational efficiencies offsetting higher investments in research and development and higher employee-related costs. Income from operations increased 19percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to increased revenue and operational efficiencies that offset higher investments and higher general infrastructure costs that were made in research and development and selling, general, and administrative to support our growth.
Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business On December1, 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago TechnologiesLtd. ("Avago"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA"), Agilent received approximately $2.6billion in cash proceeds. For further information, see Note4, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor Products Business", to our consolidated financial statements.
53 Discontinued operations results for our semiconductor products business, including the gain from sale in the year ended October31, 2006, are summarized in the table below. In the year ended October31, 2005, the results include the camera module business, which was sold in February2005.
Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Net revenue $ 141 $ 1,796 Costs, expenses and other income (expense), net 133 1,564 Income from discontinued operations 8 232 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,816  Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations before taxes 1,824 232 Provision for income taxes 8 46 Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations, net $ 1,816 $ 186 Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business On August15, 2005, Agilent announced its intention to separate its semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy, into a stand-alone publicly traded company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds of $121million. As part of the offering, Agilent made a payment to Verigy of $19million, the amount by which the net IPO proceeds were insufficient to complete the agreed-upon Verigy initial capitalization of $140million. As a result of the IPO, Agilent recorded additional paid-in capital of $74million related to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares sold. Following the offering, Agilent owned 50million shares or approximately 85percent of Verigy's ordinary shares.
On October31, 2006, Agilent completed the spin-off of Verigy by distributing its remaining 85percent equity interest in Verigy to Agilent stockholders. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend to Agilent stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by $310million. In the distribution, Agilent distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of close of market on October16, 2006. In the aggregate, Agilent distributed 50million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent stockholders. Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October31, 2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value of the shares distributed in the distribution was $840million. The historical results of Verigy have been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. For further information, see Note5, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business", to our consolidated financial statements.
54 The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations for the presented periods ended October31 included in the consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Net revenue $ 777 $ 454 Costs and expenses 703 489 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 74 (35 ) Other income (expense), net  (2 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes 74 (37 ) Provision for income taxes 20 13 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 54 $ (50 ) Indemnifications In connection with the divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses in 2006, we have provided indemnities to Verigy and Avago against certain damages which they might incur related to the businesses of Agilent not transferred to them and other defined categories of liability. These indemnity obligations are in addition to preexisting indemnities to Hewlett Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP; indemnities to our officers and directors for certain liabilities which they might incur as a result of their service to Agilent; and other indemnifications which are customary in our industry or provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in connection with our commercial operations. These indemnities are described in greater detail in Note16, "Guarantees", to our consolidated financial statements.
Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position as of October31, 2007 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1,826million as compared to $2,262million as of October31, 2006. On May11, 2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300million unsecured credit facility that will expire on May11, 2012. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. To date the company has not borrowed under the facility, but may borrow from time to time as necessary.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $969million in 2007 compared to $431million provided in 2006.
In 2007, accounts receivable generated cash of $22million as compared to cash generation of $8million in 2006. Days sales outstanding improved to 46days in 2007 as compared to 47days in 2006. Though revenue increased by 9percent year-over-year, decline in day's sales outstanding reflects continuing improvement in receivables management. Accounts payable used cash of $13million in 2007 versus cash generation of $56million in 2006. Cash used for inventory was $21million in 2007 compared to cash used of $55million in 2006. Inventory days on-hand decreased to 88days in 2007 compared to 95days in 2006. Improvement in both days sales outstanding and inventory days on hand reflect our improved working capital management in 2007 compared to 2006.
55 We paid $51million in connection with the FY05 restructuring plan in 2007, primarily in the form of severance payments, compared to $166million during 2006. The restructuring payments in 2006 were more than offset by proceeds from the real estate sales related to the consolidation of excess facilities as reported in the investing section below. We have also paid approximately $174million in 2007 under our variable pay programs, as compared to $155million paid out during 2006. Our variable pay program rewards employees based on the success of their business group, as well as Agilent's overall performance.
We paid approximately $86million in taxes in 2007 as compared to $156million in the same period in 2006. The higher tax payments in 2006 were mostly associated with the U.S. tax liability created in 2005 for repatriation of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries of $970million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and with the 2005 federal alternate minimum tax.
We contributed $8million and $41million to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2007 and 2006, respectively. We contributed $37million and $76million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. Total contributions in 2007 were $45million or 62percent less than 2006 due largely to an approximate $31million contribution to Verigy pension plans in 2006. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. The reduced funding amounts in the U.S. were due to an improved funded status. We expect to contribute approximately $42million to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2008.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities of Continuing Operations Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations in 2007 was $456million compared to $1,838million generated in 2006. Cash generation in 2006 was high due to the divestiture of our semiconductor products business for $2.5billion, net of transaction costs and taxes. We also completed the sale of our ownership in Lumileds to Philips for $949million. In 2006, restricted cash and cash equivalents, net increased by approximately $1.6billion. We are required to hold restricted cash and cash equivalents due to the World Trade financing described under "net cash used in financing activities" below.
Investments in property, plant and equipment were $154million in 2007, as compared to investment of $185million in 2006. The lower capital expenditure from last year was due to the site consolidation and relocation following the semiconductor products business divestiture and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business in 2006. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were $12million in 2007 as compared to $207million in 2006. In 2006, we sold our Palo Alto and San Jose sites for a total consideration of approximately $186million. In 2007, we invested $344million in several acquisitions and intangible assets, net of cash acquired, including Stratagene, compared to $50million in 2006. In 2007, proceeds from sale of assets and divestiture, net were $14million.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities of Continuing Operations Net cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $980million compared to $2,548million used in 2006.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2billion of our common stock. In 2007, we completed this stock repurchase program and repurchased approximately 54million shares for $1.94billion. In 2006, we had repurchased 1.7million shares for $56million under this program. As of October31, 2007, we have acquired approximately 56 181million shares for approximately $6.5billion, cumulatively, since the inception of repurchase programs in 2005. Proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans were $375million in 2007 compared to $547million in 2006. On November15, 2007 our Board of Directors approved a share-repurchase program of up to $2billion of Agilent's common stock over the next two years.
In October2007, Agilent Technologies,Inc. entered into an underwriting agreement with Citigroup Global MarketsInc. and J.P. Morgan SecuritiesInc. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, Agilent issued an aggregate principal amount of $600million in senior notes in an underwritten public offering. The senior notes were issued at a price to the public of 99.60% of their principal amount. We received cash of $598million in October, 2007. The Notes will mature on November1, 2017, bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum, payable semi-annually on May1 and November1 of each year, commencing on May1, 2008. Upon the closing of the offering of the senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600million. Under the interest rate swaps we will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the six month US dollar LIBOR. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate.
In January2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade,Inc., a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent ("World Trade"), entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with a third party pursuant to which World Trade sold 15,000 ClassA preferred shares of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5billion. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the third party those preferred shares for 100percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January2011. The $1.5billion obligation of our subsidiary to repurchase the preferred shares has been classified as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note17 "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.
Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
On December11, 2006, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") upgraded their corporate family rating and probability of default rating of Agilent from "Ba2" to "Ba1" and revised their rating outlook to positive, leaving unchanged the speculative grade liquidity rating of "SGL-1". On January12, 2007, Standard& Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings of Agilent to "BBB-" from "BB+", with a "stable" ratings outlook. On March22, 2007, Moody's lowered its outlook to "Stable" from "Positive" due to the company's announcement to accelerate its shares repurchase program. On March29, 2007, Fitch Ratings initiated coverage of Agilent by assigning an issuer default rating of "BBB-" with "Stable" outlook.
57 Contractual Commitments Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October31, 2007 for continuing operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Operating leases $ 78 $ 94 $ 42 $ 36 Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 426    Other purchase commitments 25 20 5 2 Retirement plans 42    Total $ 571 $ 114 $ 47 $ 38 Operating leases.
Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property.
Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 42percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
In addition to the above, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October31, 2007, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments was $6million, compared with $9million as of October31, 2006. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
Other purchase commitments.
These relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers. Purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90-day period without significant penalties.
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October31, 2007 or October31, 2006.
58 Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 64percent of our revenues in 2007, 63percent of our revenues in 2006 and 64percent of our revenues in 2005 were generated in U.S. dollars.
We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October31, 2007 and October31, 2006, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" as of October31, 2007 and changed the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as of October31, 2007.
As discussed in Note3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R), "Share-Based Payment" as of November1, 2005 and changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in fiscal 2006.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide 61 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

66 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Agilent Technologies,Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May1999, is a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 16percent of our stock in November1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). HP distributed the remaining 84percent of our stock to its stockholders on June2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend.
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. The results of our semiconductor products business are presented as a discontinued operation for all periods in the consolidated financial statements included herein. In the third quarter of 2006, we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business, VerigyLtd., ("Verigy"). Verigy was a majority-owned subsidiary of Agilent until the distribution of our remaining Verigy shares to Agilent stockholders on October31, 2006. The results of our semiconductor test solutions business are presented as a discontinued operation for all periods in the consolidated financial statements included herein.
Basis of presentation.
The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our fiscal year end is October31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and has full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, statement of cash flows and statement of stockholders' equity for all periods presented.
Principles of consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Partially owned, non-controlled equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method.
Use of estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes.
67 Revenue recognition.
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.
We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2)delivery has occurred, (3)the price is fixed or determinable and (4)collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. We consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable, and accordingly we defer revenue until amounts become due. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition.
Product revenue.
Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns, when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete.
Where software is embedded in our test equipment products, the software component is generally considered to be incidental. Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence.
Service revenue.
Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer support, consulting, training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized.
Multiple element arrangements.
We use relative fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If the criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period(s) over which the last undelivered element is delivered. In the absence of fair value of a delivered element, we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. The price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value.
Deferred revenue.
Amounts billed or collected in advance of the period in which the related product or service qualifies for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.
68 Accounts receivable, net.
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns.
Share-based compensation.
For the years ended 2007 and 2006, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies,Inc. Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting in accordance with SFAS, No.123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No.123(R)"), which was effective November1, 2005 for Agilent. Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations for share-based awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under SFAS No.123 were in effect for expense recognition purposes. Additionally, we recorded compensation expense using the fair value method for all share-based awards granted after November1, 2005. We recorded SFAS No.123(R) compensation expense of $139 and $94million for the years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, share-based compensation expense included $15million of incremental net expense associated with the modification of the FY2005 LTPP program. In September2007 our Board of Directors approved a modification that removed the performance metric from the payout computation for the FY2005 plan only. The modification changed the award payout calculation to be based exclusively on the market performance.
Through year end 2005, we accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No.25"). Under the intrinsic value method, we recorded compensation expense related to stock options in our consolidated statement of operations when the exercise price of our employee share-based award was less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. Compensation expense was also recorded for the LTPP using the variable accounting method. We recorded APB No.25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8million in 2005. The APB No.25 compensation expense in 2005 primarily related to our LTPP. We currently issue new shares for award exercises.
Inventory.
Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.
Taxes on income.
Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
69 Warranty.
Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies" ("SFAS No.5"), based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of gross product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note16, "Guarantees".
Shipping and handling costs.
Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
Our accounting complies with SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No.142"). Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally three to fifteen years.
Advertising.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $48million in 2007, $44million in 2006 and $33million in 2005 for Agilent continuing operations.
Research and development.
Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.
Sales Taxes.
Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.
Net income (loss) per share.
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. In computing diluted net income (loss) per share under the treasury stock method, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds of stock option exercises. For the fiscal years 2007 and 2006 the number of shares assumed to be purchased also considered the amount of unrecognized compensation cost for future service as required under SFAS No.123 (R). Diluted net income per share for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 excluded the potentially dilutive effect of 5million, 8million and 49million options to purchase common stock, respectively, as their effect was antidilutive. Our then outstanding $1.15billion senior convertible debenture was redeemed as of September9, 2005 and therefore no longer outstanding nor part of the computation in 2006.
Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments.
We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Approximately 30percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S., and 38percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. The remainder is held by other Agilent entities throughout the world. Approximately 10percent of our overall cash and cash equivalents is maintained in demand deposit accounts with global financial institutions of high credit quality and is 70 available to be used in paying and receiving activities. The remainder is invested in institutional money market funds, short-term bank time deposits and similar short duration instruments with fixed maturities from overnight to three months. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our surplus funds. We have not experienced any credit losses from cash investments.
We classify investments as short-term investments if their original or remaining maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost.
Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $1.6billion in 2007 and 2006 and $22million in 2005.
Fair value of financial instruments.
The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available.
Concentration of credit risk.
Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. Credit evaluation is performed by an independent team to ensure proper segregation of duties. No single customer accounted for more than 10percent or more of combined accounts receivable as of October31, 2007.
Derivative instruments.
Agilent is exposed to global market exchange rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options, to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures, which include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, which has the exposure. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To achieve hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions, such as China, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFASNo.133"). In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
71 All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow or net investment hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in accumulated comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Amounts associated with net investment hedges are recognized only when the subsidiary is sold or liquidated. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No.133 are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not significant.
We may also, from time to time, acquire warrants or other equity types of securities to purchase securities of other companies as part of strategic relationships.
Property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We currently use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.
Leases.
We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from one to twenty years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to twenty years. These operating leases are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases." Capitalized software.
We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years when development is complete.
Impairment of long-lived assets.
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Employee compensation and benefits.
Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total 72 amount of accrued vacation benefit was $147million as of October31, 2007 and $133million as of October31, 2006.
Foreign currency translation.
We follow SFAS No.52, "Foreign Currency Translation", for both the translation and remeasurement of balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The cumulative translation adjustment balance at October31, 2007 and 2006 was $357million and $207million, respectively.
For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for nonmonetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income (loss). Foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income, net and were $17million net gain, $2 million net loss and $7million net gain for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
2.New Accounting Pronouncements In June2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No.48, "Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties" ("FIN No.48"). FIN No.48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the taxing authority and provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN No.48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN No.48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. The differences between the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of FIN No.48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No.48 on our consolidated financial statements.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No.157"). SFAS No.157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. SFAS No.157 applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards (except for measurements of share-based payments) and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements. SFAS No.157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS No.157 will be applied prospectively with some exceptions that will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No.157 on our consolidated financial statements.
In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FAS115" ("SFAS No.159"). SFAS No.159 allows 73 companies to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No.159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007 and will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.159 on our consolidated financial statements.
On October31, 2007, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132 (R)" ("SFAS No.158"). This standard requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of each plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet with the offsetting change in that funded status to accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon adoption, this standard requires immediate recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income of actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/benefits both of which were previously unrecognized. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are eliminated upon adoption of the new standard. As required by SFAS No.158, the company will move the measurement date for our non-U.S. plans from September30 to October31 effective October31, 2009. Adoption of this statement resulted in a $27million decrease of assets, net of taxes; a $154million decrease of liabilities, net of taxes; and a $127million increase in equity, net of taxes.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141R, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No.141R"). SFAS No.141R amends SFAS141 and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. It is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008 and will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.141R on our consolidated financial statements.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No.51" ("SFAS No.160"). SFAS No.160 requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, and the amount of consolidated net income, be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires once a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. Sufficient disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. It is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008 and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. All other requirements shall be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.160 on our consolidated financial statements.
3.Share-Based Compensation Effective November1, 2005, Agilent adopted the provisions of SFAS No.123 (R)which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. Agilent previously 74 applied the provisions of APB No.25 and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No.123").
Description of Share-Based Plans Employee stock purchase plan.
Effective November1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. Under the provisions of the ESPP, eligible employees may contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85percent of the lower of the fair market value at the entry date or the purchase date as defined by the ESPP. The ESPP has a maximum contractual term of two years. As of October31, 2007, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 24,827,099. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding common stock of Agilent or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed 75million shares.
Incentive compensation plans.
On September17, 1999, we adopted the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 1999 Stock Plan (the "Stock Plan") and subsequently reserved 67,800,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the Stock Plan. In addition, on May31, 2000, 19,000,000 shares of our common stock were registered pursuant to converted stock options previously granted by HP. In February2001, our stockholders approved an additional 45,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the Stock Plan. These shares were subsequently registered in May2002. At October31, 2007, shares available for option and restricted stock grants were 34,497,002.
Stock options, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights may be granted under the Stock Plan. Options granted under the Stock Plan may be either "incentive stock options", as defined in Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant and generally have a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted.
On March4, 2003, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock Plan. The amendment permitted the company to offer a one-time exchange of options issued under the Stock Plan having an exercise price greater than $25 for a lesser number of options to be granted at least six months and one day from the cancellation of surrendered options (the "Option Exchange Program"). On May20, 2003, we implemented the Option Exchange Program by filing a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC, which allowed eligible employees a one-time opportunity to exchange options to purchase shares of the company's common stock, whether vested or unvested, which were granted under our Stock Plan, with exercise prices greater than $25 per share. The Option Exchange Program was offered from May20, 2003 to June18, 2003 and options to purchase approximately 26million shares were exchanged, with an average exercise price of $51. As a result, the company issued options to purchase approximately 13.8million shares at a weighted-average exercise price of $28 per share during the first quarter of 2004. Under the provisions of APB No.25 no compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for issuance of the replacement options for fiscal year ended 2005. As a result of the SFAS No.123 (R)adoption, in fiscal year ended 2006, we recognized a remaining amount of approximately $3million in our consolidated statement of operations for the issuance of these replacement options.
75 Effective November1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years. The following table summarizes the shares approved by the Compensation Committee to be issued under the LTPP: Period Approved Target Award Shares Fiscal Year Shares May Be Awarded FY2005 LTPP 498,814 2008 FY2006 LTPP 466,669 2009 FY2007 LTPP 447,684 2010 FY2008 LTPP 364,396 2011 In all cases, the final award may vary from zero to 200percent of the target award as it is based on certain performance metrics. We consider the dilutive impact of this program in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are met.
On March1, 2007 we issued restricted stock units under the Stock Plan. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant and generally have a maximum contractual term of ten years.
Pro forma Information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of SFAS No.123(R) Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123 (R), Agilent provided the disclosures required under SFAS No.123, as amended by SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosures." No employee share-based compensation expense was reflected in our results from continuing operations in 2005 for employee stock option awards as all options were granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Our ESPP was deemed non-compensatory under the provisions of APB No.25. Compensation expense for the non-vested performance shares granted under the LTPP was recognized based on the grant date fair value for the respective grants. Forfeitures of awards were recognized as they occurred.
76 The pro forma information for share-based compensation in 2005 was as follows: Year Ended October 31, 2005 (in millions, except persharedata) Net income  as reported $ 327 APB No. 25 compensation recognized in net income, as reported 16 SFAS No. 123 based compensation (228 ) Tax benefit 12 Net income  pro forma $ 127 Net income per share: As reported: Basic $ 0.66 Diluted $ 0.65 Pro forma: Basic $ 0.26 Diluted $ 0.25 We recorded APB No.25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8million in 2005. The APB No.25 compensation expense in 2005 primarily related to our LTPP. In August2005 our Board of Directors approved a modification to the terms of the options held by employees of our semiconductor products business to effect the acceleration of vesting for all unvested options held by employees of that business, effective as of the date of the sale of the semiconductor products business to Avago. In connection with this modification, we recorded $8million of compensation expense in discontinued operations. The pro forma results in 2005 include approximately $32million of pro forma compensation expense relating to our Option Exchange Program. The weighted average grant date fair value of options, as determined under SFAS No.123, granted in 2005 was $7.80 per share.
Due to the valuation allowance provided on our net deferred tax assets as described in Note7, "Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations", we did not record any tax benefits attributable to pro forma share-based compensation expenses for employees in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions in 2005. The 2005 tax impact presented above was computed for both the APB No.25 and SFAS No.123 share-based compensation expense.
Impact of SFAS No.123 (R) Agilent adopted SFAS No.123 (R)using the modified prospective transition method beginning November1, 2005. Accordingly, in 2006, we recorded share-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under SFAS No.123 were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The effect of forfeitures on the unamortized compensation expense of pre-adoption awards was not material. For these awards, we have continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method under FASB Interpretation No.28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an interpretation of APB Opinions No.15 and 25". For share-based awards granted after November1, 77 2005 we have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under SFAS No.123 (R). For these awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As SFAS No.123 (R)requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation in 2007 and 2006 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Amounts previously reported prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123 (R)have not been restated.
The impact on our results for share-based compensation in 2007 and 2006 was as follows: Years Ended October31, 2007 2006 (in millions, except persharedata) Cost of products and services $ 31 $ 27 Research and development 22 17 Selling, general and administrative 86 50 Share-based compensation expense in continuing operations $ 139 $ 94 Share-based compensation expense in discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business  3 Share-based compensation expense in discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business  9 Share-based compensation expense  Agilent awards 139 106 Share-based compensation expense in discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business  Verigy awards  2 Total share-based compensation expense $ 139 $ 108 Impact on continuing operations per share: Basic $ 0.35 $ 0.22 Diluted $ 0.34 $ 0.21 Impact on discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business per share: Basic  $ 0.01 Diluted  $ 0.01 Impact on discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business  Agilent and Verigy awards per share: Basic  $ 0.02 Diluted  $ 0.02 Impact on net income per share: Basic $ 0.35 $ 0.25 Diluted $ 0.34 $ 0.24 At October31, 2007 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory as the amount would have been immaterial. Total income tax benefit recognized in 2007 and 2006 in the statement of operations for share-based compensation was immaterial. In 2007 and 2006 the windfall tax benefit realized from exercised stock options and similar awards was immaterial. The weighted 78 average grant date fair value of options, as determined under SFAS No.123 (R), granted in 2007 and 2006 was $10.98 and $10.46 per share, respectively.
Included in the 2007 share-based compensation expense amount of $139million is $6million of expense related to the FY2004 LTPP program. During 2007, we received the final performance results of our FY2004 LTPP program which ended on October31, 2006. The results indicated that we exceeded our specified performance targets. Consequently, we recorded incremental expense to reflect this program's performance results. In addition, in 2007, we recorded $4million of expense for the acceleration of unvested awards related to the separation of a senior executive.
In 2007, share-based compensation expense included $15million of incremental net expense associated with the modification of the FY2005 LTPP program. In September2007, our Board of Directors approved a modification that removed the performance metric from the payout computation for the FY2005 program only. The modification changed the award payout calculation to be based exclusively on the market metric. The number of shares to be awarded under the FY2005 LTPP program will be 200percent of the target award.
Included in income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No.123 (R)for the fiscal year ended 2006 was approximately $3million of share-based compensation expense in connection with the 2005 modification to the terms of the options held by employees of our divested semiconductor products business.
Included in income from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No.123 (R)for fiscal year ended 2006 was $9million of share-based compensation expense for Agilent options held by Verigy employees and $2million of new Verigy awards that were issued prior to the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent. As a result of the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent which took place on October31, 2006, non-vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees were cancelled. Vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees received a period of up to three months in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options were cancelled. Retirement eligible Verigy employees received a period of up to three years in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options will be cancelled. To the extent that the Agilent options were not vested as of the distribution date, Verigy issued replacement Verigy awards.
Valuation Assumptions For all periods presented, the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards and employee stock purchases made under our ESPP was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In 2007 and 2006, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. In 2005, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using the variable accounting method under APB No.25. In 2007 the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant.
79 The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options granted, ESPP purchases and the LTPP in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 Stock Option Plans: Weighted average risk-free interest rate 4.61 % 4.40 % 3.60 % Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Weighted average volatility 29 % 29 % 39 % Expected life 4.60 yrs 4.25 yrs 4 yrs ESPP: Weighted average risk-free interest rate 4.80 % 4.50 % 2.40 % Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Weighted average volatility 31 % 29 % 37 % Expected life 0.5-2 yrs 0.5-1 yrs 0.5-2 yrs LTPP: Volatility of Agilent shares 31 % 28 % N/A Volatility of selected peer-company shares 15%-57 % 23%-82 % N/A Price-wise correlation with selected peers 29 % 50 % N/A Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Beginning November1, 2005, the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded, similarly priced, stock options. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123 (R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving our expected volatility assumption. We consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe are representative of future behavior. We have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility.
In the first quarter of 2007, we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options. In revising this estimate, we considered several factors, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees. In the first quarter of 2007, we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees, on average, exercise their options at 4.6years.
Under the anti-dilution provision of the 1999 Stock Plan, on November1, 2006, Agilent adjusted the exercise price downward and number of option shares upward for each outstanding employee stock option to preserve the value of the options after the Verigy spin-off. The impact of the adjusted exercise price and number of options has been reflected in our disclosures as of November1, 2006.
80 Share-Based Payment Award Activity The following table summarizes employee stock option award activity made to our employees and directors for 2007: Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price (in thousands) Outstanding at October 31, 2006 55,508 $ 29 Impact of Verigy Distribution 2,705 $ 29 Granted 1,433 $ 33 Exercised (12,939 ) $ 25 Cancelled (1,135 ) $ 35 Plan Shares Expired (356 ) $ 38 Outstanding at October 31, 2007 45,216 $ 29 The plan shares expired per the above table represent cancelled options granted under the HP stock option plan that are not added back to our available for grant options.
Forfeited and expired options in 2007 were as follows: Options Cancelled Weighted Average Exercise Price (in thousands) Forfeited 544 $ 28 Expired 947 $ 40 Total Options Cancelled at October 31, 2007 1,491 $ 36 The following table summarizes nonvested award activity in 2007 primarily for our LTPP and restricted stock unit awards: Shares Weighted Average Grant Price (in thousands) Nonvested at October 31, 2006 1,252 $ 29 Impact of Verigy Distribution 57 $ 29 Granted 2,538 $ 32 Vested (628 ) $ 27 Forfeited (88 ) $ 31 FY2004 LTPP Incremental Issuance 300 $ 27 Nonvested at October 31, 2007 3,431 $ 31 81 As of October31, 2007, the unrecognized share-based compensation costs for non-vested restricted stock awards, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately $55million which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.2years. The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested was $41million for 2007 and immaterial for 2006 and 2005.
The options outstanding and exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October31, 2007 were as follows: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number Exercisable Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) (in years) (in thousands) (in thousands) (in years) (in thousands) $0 - 25 15,949 5.6 $ 20 $ 261,749 12,902 5.2 $ 20 $ 213,308 $25.01 - 30 9,520 5.0 $ 27 $ 89,711 9,256 4.9 $ 27 $ 87,521 $30.01 - 40 15,737 6.8 $ 33 $ 67,079 7,964 5.6 $ 33 $ 31,740 $40.01 and over 4,010 2.0 $ 50  4,010 2.0 $ 50  45,216 5.6 $ 29 $ 418,539 34,132 4.9 $ 29 $ 332,569 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $36.85 at October31, 2007, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date. The total number of in-the-money awards exercisable at October31, 2007 was approximately 29million.
The following table summarizes the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and the fair value of options granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005: Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted Average Exercise Price Value Using Black-Scholes Model (in millions) Options exercised during October 31, 2005 $ 42,656 $ 21 Black-Scholes value of options granted during 2005 $ 8 Options exercised during October 31, 2006 $ 195,938 $ 25 Black-Scholes value of options granted during 2006 $ 10 Options exercised during October 31, 2007 $ 152,171 $ 25 Black-Scholes value of options granted during 2007 $ 11 The amount of cash received from the exercise of share-based awards granted was $375million in 2007, $547million in 2006 and $198million in 2005. See Note7, "Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations" for the tax impact on share-based award exercises.
4.Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business On December1, 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago TechnologiesLtd. ("Avago"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA"), 82 Agilent received approximately $2,559million in cash proceeds. The following table shows the components of the gain from sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes as of October31, 2006: (in millions) Proceeds, net of working capital adjustments $ 2,559 Book value of net assets disposed of (707 ) Costs of disposition, net (36 ) Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,816 Income taxes 6 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net $ 1,810 Subsequent to the quarter ended January31, 2006, we adjusted the gain on sale of discontinued operations by $23million which includes $21million for working capital and other adjustments and $2million for the disposal of fixed assets. The $36million costs of disposition are reported net of a gain of $51million for pension curtailments and settlements. The tax impact of the sale of our semiconductor products business reflects the utilization of the valuation allowance within the U.S. and a low effective tax rate in other jurisdictions.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect our semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business for the periods ended October31, 2006 and 2005 included in the consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended October31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Net revenue $ 141 $ 1,796 Costs, expenses and other income (expense), net 133 1,564 Income from discontinued operations 8 232 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,816  Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations before taxes 1,824 232 Provision for income taxes 8 46 Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations, net $ 1,816 $ 186 Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that 83 Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago are generally limited to 10percent of the purchase price and survived until March31, 2007.
5.Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business On August15, 2005, Agilent announced its intention to separate its semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy, into a stand-alone publicly traded company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds of $121million. As part of the offering, Agilent made a payment to Verigy of $19million, the amount by which the net IPO proceeds were insufficient to complete the agreed-upon Verigy initial capitalization of $140million. Following the offering, Agilent owned approximately 50million shares or 85percent of Verigy's ordinary shares. As a result of the IPO, Agilent recorded additional paid-in capital of $74million related to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares sold. Underwriter fees related to the IPO were approximately $9million which were netted against the proceeds. Agilent recorded direct IPO costs of $2million within operating expenses related to third-party legal fees, filing fees and other services.
On October31, 2006, Agilent completed the spin-off of Verigy by distributing its remaining 85percent equity interest in Verigy to Agilent stockholders. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend to Agilent stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by $310million. In the distribution, Agilent distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of close of market on October16, 2006. In the aggregate, Agilent distributed 50million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent stockholders. Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October31, 2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value of the shares distributed in the distribution was approximately $840million. The historical results of Verigy have been reflected as discontinued operations in the underlying financial statements and related disclosures for all periods presented.
The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business for the presented periods ended October31 included in the consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Net revenue $ 777 $ 454 Costs and expenses 703 489 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 74 (35 ) Other income (expense), net  (2 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes 74 (37 ) Provision for income taxes 20 13 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 54 $ (50 ) 84 Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June1, 2006.
6.Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. ("Lumileds"), was a global joint venture between Agilent and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ("Philips") under a Second Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture Agreement"), dated as of November29, 2004, between Agilent and Philips. Lumileds manufactures high-power light emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Our ownership interest in Lumileds was approximately 47percent as of October31, 2005, after selling 1percent of our interest to Philips in the second quarter of 2005. Our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in Lumileds was $901million in 2006 and $42million in 2005.
On November28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, upon closure of the sale transaction, the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated. The purchase price paid by Philips under the Share Purchase Agreement was $949million. In addition, Lumileds repaid the $51million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest due to us as of the date of sale under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November30, 2001.
The following table shows the components of the gain from sale of Lumileds, net of income tax: Year Ended October31, 2006 (in millions) Proceeds $ 949 Net book value of investments (48 ) Gain on sale before taxes 901 Income taxes  Gain from sale of Lumileds, net of taxes $ 901 The tax impact of the sale of our Lumileds joint venture primarily reflected the utilization of the valuation allowances within the U.S.
85 7.Provision (Benefit) For Income Taxes From Continuing Operations The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations is comprised of: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) U.S. federal taxes from continuing operations: Current $ 71 $ 1 $ 40 Deferred (127 )   Non-U.S. taxes from continuing operations: Current 91 95 109 Deferred (5 ) (9 ) (10 ) State taxes from continuing operations, net of federal benefit: Current 3 4 3 Deferred (1 )   Total provision from continuing operations $ 32 $ 91 $ 142 The income tax provisions do not reflect tax savings resulting from excess deductions associated with our various share-based award plans.
The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities (in millions) Inventory $ 74 $  $ 78 $ 2 Property, plant and equipment 12 94  150 Warranty reserves 11 1 13 1 Retiree medical benefits 47  44  Other retirement benefits 32 186 34 99 Employee benefits, other than retirement 216  205  Net operating loss and credit carryforwards 301  470  Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries  303  305 Share-based compensation 44  17  Deferred revenue 273    Other 108 100 136 73 Subtotal 1,118 684 997 630 Tax valuation allowance (332 )  (382 )  Total deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities $ 786 $ 684 $ 615 $ 630 86 The breakdown between current and long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows for the years 2007 and 2006: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 (in millions) Current deferred tax assets $ 267 $ 152 Long-term deferred tax assets 46 19 Current deferred tax liabilities (4 ) (4 ) Long-term deferred tax liabilities (207 ) (182 ) Total $ 102 $ (15 ) The consolidated balance sheet reflects the allocation of the valuation allowance based on the pro-rata portion of gross current and non-current deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction where a valuation allowance is required. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No.109"), which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. During 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets will be realized. We did not conclude that any of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be similarly realized. Cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence under SFAS No.109 to require full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain full valuation allowances for these U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal.
At October31, 2007, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $36million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $117million. The federal net operating losses expire in years beginning 2010 through 2026, if not utilized. The federal tax credits expire beginning in 2015 through 2017, if not utilized. At October31, 2007, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $713million. The state net operating losses expire in years beginning 2009 through 2022, if not utilized. In addition, the company has state tax credit carryforwards of $19million. State tax credits of $11million expire beginning in 2008 through 2021, if not utilized. A portion of the federal and state net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. These annual loss limitations may result in the expiration or reduced utilization of the net operating losses and/or credits. At October31, 2007, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $496million. Of this foreign loss, $192million will expire in years beginning 2009 through 2015, if not utilized. The remaining $304million has an indefinite life. Some of the foreign losses are subject to annual loss limitation rules.
SFAS No.123 (R)prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits related to share-based award plans that have not yet been realized through reduction in income taxes payable. Such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled $128million as of October31, 2007 and will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable.
87 The differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective tax rate from continuing operations are: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 0.5 0.2 0.6 Non-U.S. income taxed at different rates (16.3 ) 2.5 26.9 Research credits (1.1 ) (0.1 ) (2.9 ) Extraterritorial income exclusion (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (3.2 ) AJCA dividend repatriation   7.2 Hewlett-Packard settlement or spin related (10.8 ) (1.8 )  Other, net 1.7 0.5 0.4 Valuation allowances (4.1 ) (30.0 ) (21.4 ) Effective tax rate 4.8 % 6.0 % 42.6 % The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) earnings from continuing operations before taxes are: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) U.S. continuing operations $ (460 ) $ 867 $ 208 Non-U.S. continuing operations 1,130 661 125 Total income (loss) from continuing operations $ 670 $ 1,528 $ 333 The income tax provision for 2007 includes a benefit of $31million related to valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in other comprehensive income items, portions of which are attributable to increases in currency translation adjustments and to increases in the value of certain stock investments. In addition, the tax rate includes benefits totaling $73million related to the resolution of primarily non-U.S. tax issues associated with the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard.
The income tax provision for 2006 includes a benefit of $29million related to the resolution of domestic tax-related issues for years covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The Tax Sharing Agreement is related to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard.
On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and reported an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970million and a related tax liability of approximately $48million in our fiscal 2005 federal and state income tax 88 returns. For fiscal 2005, $23million of the $48million is provided for in the discontinuing operations' provision for income taxes while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations' provision for income taxes.
Agilent has recorded $303million of deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries. This represents a portion of the deferred taxes associated with the cumulative earnings of $2,374million. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. Our policy is to continue to invest the undistributed earnings of these certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the United States, with the exception of the amounts repatriated in the year ended October31, 2005 under the AJCA. If management decides to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.
Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. During the years 2003 through 2007, Agilent enjoyed tax holidays that applied to manufacturing income generated in Malaysia and Singapore. The tax holiday in Malaysia expires in 2010. In Singapore, one holiday expires in 2008 and the other has expired. In 2004, Agilent secured a reduced tax rate in Switzerland for income generated from activity that Agilent began in Switzerland during that year. The tax holiday expires in 2013. Also in 2004, Agilent secured an additional Singapore tax holiday for earnings from investments and related activity that began in 2004. The tax holiday applies to applicable earnings of Agilent until the end of 2013, with the opportunity for a reduced rate thereafter.
As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $190million, $76million and $54million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.47, $0.17 and $0.11 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002 have been under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). In August2007, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR"). In the RAR, the IRS proposes to assess a net tax deficiency, after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits, for those years of approximately $405million, plus penalties of approximately $160million and interest. If the IRS were to fully prevail, our net operating loss and tax credits generated in recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been, and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result. The RAR addresses several issues. One issue, however, relating to the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates, accounts for a majority of the claimed tax deficiency. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to this claim. Therefore we have not included any tax for this item in our tax provision for 2007. We have filed a formal protest and requested a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS and have opposed this claim, and most of the other claimed adjustments proposed in the RAR, vigorously. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may take several years. Based on current information, it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes 89 resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
8.Net Income (Loss) Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations for the periods presented below.
Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Numerator: Income from continuing operations $ 638 $ 1,437 $ 191 Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business  1,816 186 Income (loss) from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business  54 (50 ) Net income $ 638 $ 3,307 $ 327 Denominators: Basic weighted average shares 394 431 494 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents  stock options and other employee stock plans 12 10 6 Diluted weighted average shares 406 441 500 The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share- based compensation required by SFAS No.123 (R). The total number of awards exercised in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 13million, 19million and 5million, respectively.
In connection with the October31, 2006 Verigy distribution, on November1, 2006 Agilent distributed .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of October16, 2006 to Agilent's stockholders. In addition, under the anti-dilution provision of the 1999 Stock Plan, on November1, 2006 Agilent adjusted the exercise price downward and number of option shares upward for each outstanding employee stock option to preserve the value of the options after the Verigy spin-off. For further details on the distribution see Note3, "Share-Based Compensation." 90 The following table presents options to purchase shares of common stock, which were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because they were anti-dilutive.
Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 Options to purchase shares of common stock (in millions) 5 8 49 Weighted-average exercise price $ 47 $ 45 $ 33 Average common stock price $ 35 $ 34 $ 25 9.Supplemental Cash Flow Information Cash paid for income taxes was $86million in 2007, $156million in 2006 and $75million in 2005. Cash paid for interest was $85million in 2007, $55million in 2006 and $44million in 2005.
In 2007, we capitalized approximately $5million as debt issuance costs related to the senior notes. In 2006, we spent $25million as debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt and amortized $5million and $4million in interest expense during 2007 and 2006 respectively.
Non cash transactions in 2005 primarily related to the conversion of approximately $466million of the principal amount of convertible debt into common stock. In addition, accrued interest of approximately $4million relating to the convertible debt was recorded in equity as part of the cost of the new shares issued.
10.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents As of October31, 2007, $1,615million was reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. Of this amount, $1,580million was short-term restricted commercial paper maintained in connection with our obligations to a counterparty pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation entered into on January27, 2006 and reported as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note19 "Senior Notes, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities." As of October31, 2006, $1,606million was reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. Of this amount $1,582million was short-term restricted commercial paper.

We sold our San Jose site for a total consideration of $88million and recorded a gain of $56million during the second quarter of 2006. In May2006, we completed the sale of our Palo Alto site for a total consideration of $98.5million and recorded a gain of $65million.
13.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The goodwill balances at October31, 2007 and 2006 and the movements in 2007 and 2006 for each of our reportable segments are shown in the table below: Electronic Measurement Bio-analytical Measurement Total (in millions) Goodwill at October 31, 2005 $ 255 $ 52 $ 307 Foreign currency translation impact 1 1 2 Goodwill arising from acquisitions 12 64 76 Goodwill at October 31, 2006 268 117 385 Foreign currency translation impact 10 (2 ) 8 Goodwill arising from acquisitions 39 126 165 Goodwill at October 31, 2007 $ 317 $ 241 $ 558 92 The component parts of other intangible assets at October31, 2007 and 2006 are shown in the table below: Other Intangible Assets Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value (in millions) As of October 31, 2006: Purchased technology $ 208 $ 143 $ 65 Customer relationships 50 32 18 Total $ 258 $ 175 $ 83 As of October 31, 2007: Purchased technology $ 280 $ 173 $ 107 Trademark/Tradename 31 1 30 Customer relationships 82 41 41 Total $ 393 $ 215 $ 178 We purchased $135million of other intangibles and recorded $165million of goodwill during 2007.
Amortization of intangible assets was $40million in 2007, $24million in 2006 and $13million in 2005. Future amortization expense related to existing intangible assets is estimated to be $40million in 2008, $33million in 2009, $28million in 2010, $25million in 2011, $18million in 2012 and $34million thereafter.
In February2006, we acquired the remaining 49percent minority interest in Yokogawa Analytical Systems, a joint venture between Agilent and Yokogawa Electrical Corporation. This acquisition resulted in the recording of $43million in intangible assets and $60million of goodwill. In addition, during 2006 we recorded two acquisitions, one earn out payment on an acquisition completed in 2005, and one joint venture buyout payment. Pro forma disclosures are not presented for these transactions as they were not material.
Acquisition of Stratagene On June6, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Stratagene, a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of specialized life science research and diagnostic products. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $252million in cash used to purchase 100percent of Stratagene's outstanding common shares and vested common stock options that Stratagene employees held on the close date.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price of the transaction was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We may adjust the purchase price allocation after obtaining more information regarding taxes. In our fourth quarter of 2007 when we finalized our assessment of the pre-acquisition contingencies, we reduced goodwill by $11million.
93 Based upon the purchase price of the acquisition, the purchase price allocation is as follows: (in millions) Net tangible assets $ 41 Goodwill 112 Identifiable intangible assets 99 Total net assets acquired $ 252 Identifiable intangible assets consist of purchased technology, customer relationships, and trademarks. The useful life was based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows, in accordance with SFAS142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets".
As part of the merger agreement with Stratagene we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Catalyst LLC ("Catalyst"), a Delaware limited liability company, to sell, transfer, and assign certain intangible and tangible assets to Catalyst on June7, 2007. Catalyst was formed by the former chairman, CEO and founder of Stratagene to pursue molecular diagnostic applications. We received a total of $7million in cash; $5million for intangible assets and $2million for tangible assets. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale of these assets to Catalyst.
The results of operations for Stratagene have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The financial results of this acquisition are considered immaterial for purposes of pro forma financial disclosures. Goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of Stratagene is not deductible for tax purposes.
14.Investments Investments in cost basis and equity method investments and securities classified as trading securities or available-for-sale were as follows at October31, 2007 and 2006 (net book value): October 31, 2007 2006 (in millions) Cost method investments $ 24 $ 34 Trading securities 72 62 Available-for-sale investments (original cost of $64 million in 2007 and $62 million in 2006) 101 76 Total $ 197 $ 172 Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity.
All of our investments (excluding trading securities) are subject to periodic impairment review. However, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment.
94 Charges related to other than temporary impairments were $7million in 2007, $1million in 2006 and $18million in 2005. These impairment charges were recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Net unrealized gains on our net trading securities portfolio were $10million in 2007, $6million in 2006 and $5million in 2005. Realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities was $2million in 2007, $9million in 2006 and $8million in 2005. Realized gains and losses from the sale of cost method securities were immaterial for 2007, 2006 and 2005. These amounts have been included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we sold our remaining interest in Lumileds to Philips. See Note6 "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds" for further details.
15.Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans General.
Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits and a death benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan for our eligible U.S. employees.
Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the retirement and deferred profit-sharing plans, defined benefits which are generally based on an employee's highest five consecutive years' average pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under our defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"), which was closed to new participants as of November1993.
As of October31, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of plan assets and the total projected benefit obligation of the DPSP for U.S. Agilent Employees were $732million and $726million, respectively.
Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. Our U.S. retirees who retired prior to January1, 2005, are also covered by a lump sum death benefit that is part of the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan. In July2004, the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan was revised to eliminate the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit for all U.S. retirees who retire on or after January1, 2005.
401(k) defined contribution plan.
Our U.S. eligible employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Enrollment in the 401(k) Plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. Under the 401(k) Plan, we provide matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 4percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation. The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory and plan limitations. The 401(k) Plan expense included in income from continuing operations was $25million in 2007, $26million in 2006 and $25million in 2005.
95 Post-retirement medical benefit plans.
In addition to receiving pension benefits, our U.S. employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in our Non-Medicare Medical or Medicare Medical Plans (the "Post-retirement Medical Plans") under the Agilent Health Plan. Current U.S. employees may become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. Once participating in a medical plan, retirees may choose from managed-care and indemnity options, with their contributions dependent on the options chosen and length of service.
Plan amendments.
In July2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved design changes to Agilent's Post-retirement Medical Plans. One option available to existing post-65 retirees is a new Medicare Supplement Plan in 2005. The Medicare Supplement Plan supplements Medicare coverage by reimbursing Medicare Parts A and B deductibles after Medicare pays its portion of the retiree's expenses. Effective January1, 2008, the Medicare Supplement Plan reimbursement rate for Medicare Parts A and B deductibles will change from 100percent to 80percent. The U.S Post-retirement Benefit Plan was revised for eligible retirees who were less than 50years of age as of January1, 2005 and for new hires of any age on or after January1, 2005. This change established Retiree Medical Accounts with maximum lifetime limits which may be used to reimburse retiree medical premiums.
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
In December2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was passed which expands Medicare to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006. In May2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003", which provides guidance on how companies should account for the impact of the Act on its postretirement healthcare plans. Beginning in 2006, the federal government provides a non-taxable subsidy to employers that sponsor prescription drug benefits to retirees that are "actuarially equivalent" to Medicare PartD benefits. We have determined that the prescription drug benefits offered under our plans qualify for this subsidy and assuming that we will continue to offer these benefits, we have reflected the expected subsidy according to the guidance in FSP 106-2 prospectively in our financial statements.
Components of net periodic cost.
The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by SFAS No.87 which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the 96 years presented. For the years ended October31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our net pension and post-retirement benefit costs were comprised of: Pensions U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Service cost benefits earned during the period $ 40 $ 45 $ 63 $ 38 $ 45 $ 44 $ 4 $ 5 $ 6 Interest cost on benefit obligation 39 39 40 65 58 58 27 28 29 Expected return on plan assets (53 ) (51 ) (50 ) (95 ) (81 ) (73 ) (28 ) (27 ) (25 ) Amortization and deferrals: Actuarial (gain) loss (5 ) (3 ) 2 32 34 31 2 7 9 Prior service cost  1 1    (9 ) (11 ) (13 ) Net plan costs (income) 21 31 56 40 56 60 (4 ) 2 6 Curtailments and settlements (1 ) (42 )   (11 )   (38 )  Total net plan costs (income) $ 20 $ (11 ) $ 56 $ 40 $ 45 $ 60 $ (4 ) $ (36 ) $ 6 Summary of net plan costs (income): Continuing operations $ 21 $ 29 $ 45 $ 40 $ 50 $ 56 $ (4 ) $ 2 $ 5 Discontinued operations  2 11  6 4   1 Summary of Curtailments and Settlements: Continuing operations (1 ) (11 )      (12 )  Discontinued operations  (31 )   (11 )   (26 )  Total net plan costs (income) $ 20 $ (11 ) $ 56 $ 40 $ 45 $ 60 $ (4 ) $ (36 ) $ 6 As of December1, 2005, due to the divestiture of the semiconductor products business, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No.88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," ("SFASNo.88") and as required under the SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("SFAS No.106"). The impact to the U.S. Plans and the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan was curtailment gains of $22million and $21million, recorded in discontinued operations. The impact on the Non-U.S. Plans was a settlement gain of $8million recorded in discontinued operations.
Due to the separation of our semiconductor test solutions business into a separate legal company, Verigy, as of June1, 2006, and due to significant workforce reductions, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No.88 and SFAS No.106 in the third quarter of 2006. The impact to the U.S. Plans was a curtailment gain of $12million consisting of curtailment gain of $3million for continuing operations and curtailment gain of $9million for discontinued operations as well as a $4million settlement gain relating to continuing operations. The impact to the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan was a curtailment gain of $12million for continuing operations. The impact to the Non-U.S. Plans was a curtailment loss of $1million and a settlement gain of $4million, that were recorded in discontinued operations.
In the U.S., because of additional workforce reductions along with cessation of retiree medical benefits for Verigy employees as of October31, 2006, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No.88 and SFAS No.106 in the fourth quarter of 2006. The impact to the U.S. Plans was curtailment gains of $2million and a settlement gain of $2million both of which were for continuing operations. For the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan, we recorded a curtailment gain of $5million which was for discontinued operations.
97 For the U.S. plans, because of lump sum payouts in the first quarter of 2007, we recorded a $1million settlement gain in accordance with SFAS No.88.
Funded status.
As of October31, 2007 and 2006, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S.

On October31, 2007, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.158. This standard requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of each plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet with the offsetting change in that funded status to accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon adoption, this standard requires immediate recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income of actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/benefits both of which were previously unrecognized. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are eliminated upon adoption of the new standard. The statement also requires defined benefit plans to be measured at the fiscal year end. The measurement date requirement will not be effective until fiscal years ending after December15, 2008 at which point we will adopt this provision of the statement. The following table summarizes the effect of the initial adoption of this standard on individual line items of the company's consolidated balance sheet: Balance Before Adoption of SFAS No.158 Adjustments Balance After Adoption of SFAS No.158 (in millions) Other Assets, adjustment includes increase of $17million to deferred tax assets $ 758 $ (27 ) $ 731 Total assets $ 7,581 $ (27 ) $ 7,554 Retirement and Post Retirement Benefits, adjustment includes increase of $2 million to deferred tax liabilities $ 295 $ (154 ) $ 141 Accumulated other comprehensive income, adjustment includes $15 million increase of deferred taxes, net $ 281 $ 127 $ 408 Total stockholders' equity, adjustment includes $15 million increase of deferred taxes, net $ 3,107 $ 127 $ 3,234 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity, adjustment includes $15 million increase of deferred taxes, net $ 7,427 $ 127 $ 7,554 The impact of SFAS No.158 in the table above does not include any amounts relating to deferred taxes in locations where there is a tax valuation allowance.
The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net expense during 2008 are as follows: U.S. Defined BenefitPlans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (in millions) Amortization of net prior service cost (benefit) $  $ (1 ) $ (14 ) Amortization of actuarial net loss (gain) $ (13 ) $ 20 $  Investment policies and strategies as of October31, 2007 and 2006.
Plan assets consist primarily of publicly-traded stocks and bonds. In the U.S., our Agilent Retirement Plan and post-retirement benefit assets are allocated approximately 80percent to equities and approximately 20percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP assets are allocated approximately 60percent to equities and approximately 40percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 10percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of alternative investments, largely private equity partnerships. The 99 general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. The safety and protection of principal is a primary concern, and we believe that a well-diversified investment portfolio will result in the highest attainable investment return (income plus capital appreciation) with the lowest overall risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our assets are allocated from 45 to 60percent to equities, from 30 to 50percent to fixed income investments, and from 0 to 10percent to real estate investments, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. The actual allocations of plan assets are consistent with the target allocations.
The table below presents the combined projected benefit obligation ("PBO"), accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") and fair value of plan assets, grouping plans using comparisons of the PBO and ABO relative to the plan assets as of October31, 2007 or 2006.

An additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2005 for three pension plans in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated comprehensive loss was $170 million, which was partially offset by $20 million applied to deferred tax assets, net of tax valuation allowance. The large impact on accumulated comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" ("SFASNo.87"), for the impacted countries.
On June 1, 2006, in accordance with the separation agreement between Agilent and Verigy, the liability for certain Verigy employee pension benefits was transferred to separate Verigy pension plans. Agilent funded the pension liability to the extent of the accumulated benefit obligation out of operating cash. The funded status of the Non-U.S. plans required us to reverse $58 million of the additional minimum liability along with the related deferred tax impacts, of approximately $20 million.
An additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2006 for two pension plans in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated comprehensive gain was $112 million which was partially offset by $34 million applied to deferred tax assets. The large impact on accumulated comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No.87 for the impacted countries.
Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets were eliminated upon adoption of SFAS No.158.
Contributions and estimated future benefit payments.
During fiscal year 2008, we expect to contribute $1 million to the U.S. defined benefit plans, $41 million to plans outside the U.S., and zero to the Post-retirement Medical Plans. The following table presents expected future benefit payments (net of Medicare Part D reimbursements for the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan) for the next 10 years.
U.S. Defined BenefitPlans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan (in millions) 2008 $ 65 $ 36 $ 22 2009 $ 71 $ 36 $ 24 2010 $ 76 $ 40 $ 25 2011 $ 83 $ 44 $ 27 2012 $ 89 $ 45 $ 28 20132017 $ 266 $ 292 $ 162 Assumptions.
The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the table below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based, on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans October31 for the U.S.
101 plans and September30 for the non-U.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates at October31, 2007, were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve as well as reviewing the movement of industry benchmarks. The discount rates at October31, 2006 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.
Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For years ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 6.0 % 5.75 % 5.75 % Average increase in compensation levels 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 2.25-5.0 % 2.25-5.0 % 2.25-5.75 % Average increase in compensation levels 2.5-4.25 % 0-4.0 % 2.5-4.25 % Expected long-term return on assets 4.5-7.0 % 4.5-7.0 % 4.5-7.5 % U.S. post-retirement benefits plans: Discount rate 6.0 % 5.75 % 5.75 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Current medical cost trend rate 10.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % Ultimate medical cost trend rate 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2012 2011 2010 Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation and the 2006 resulting additional minimum pension liability were as follows: As of the Years Ending October 31, 2007 2006 U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 6.25 % 6.0 % Average increase in compensation levels 3.5 % 4.0 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 2.25-5.9 % 2.25-5.0 % Average increase in compensation levels 2.5%-4.0 % 0-4.25 % Expected long-term return on assets 4.5-7.25 % 4.5-7.0 % U.S. post-retirement benefits plans: Discount rate 6.25 % 6.0 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % Current medical cost trend rate 10.0 % 10.0 % Ultimate medical cost trend rate 5.0 % 5.0 % Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2013 2012 102 Assumed health care trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Post-retirement Medical Plans. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates for the year ended October31, 2007 would have the following effects: One Percentage PointIncrease One Percentage PointDecrease (in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 4 $ (3 ) Effect on post-retirement benefit obligations $ 46 $ (39 ) 16.Guarantees Standard Warranty A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below.
October 31, 2007 2006 (in millions) Balance as of October 31, 2006 and 2005 $ 29 $ 40 Accruals for warranties issued during the period 57 50 Changes in estimates (2 ) (2 ) Settlements made during the period (55 ) (59 ) Balance as of October 31, 2007 and 2006 $ 29 $ 29 Extended Warranty Revenue from our extended warranty contracts with terms beyond one year is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. Amounts representing warranty contracts for the next twelve months are included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and were $54million and $43million at October31, 2007 and October31, 2006, respectively. The long-term amounts are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and were $58million and $55million at October31, 2007 and October31, 2006, respectively.
October 31, 2007 2006 (in millions) Balance as of October 31, 2006 and 2005 $ 98 $ 76 Deferral of revenue for new contracts 58 51 Recognition of revenue (44 ) (29 ) Balance as of October 31, 2007 and 2006 $ 112 $ 98 Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses 103 that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago were generally limited to 10percent of the purchase price and survived until March31, 2007. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2007.
Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against certain damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June1, 2006. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2007.
Indemnifications to Hewlett-Packard We have given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP for the businesses that constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. These indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property and environmental matters. The agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on FormS-1 filed on August16, 1999. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2007.
Indemnifications to Officers and Directors Our corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these obligations was zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of October31, 2007.
104 Other Indemnifications As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October31, 2007.
17.Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Commitments: We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases related to continuing operations at October31, 2007 were $78million for 2008, $56million for 2009, $38million for 2010, $26million for 2011, $16million for 2012 and $36million thereafter. Future minimum sublease income under leases at October31, 2007 was $12million for 2008, $10million for 2009, $8million for 2010, $5million for 2011, $4million for 2012 and $1million thereafter. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense, including charges relating to the consolidation of excess facilities, for continuing operations was $73million in 2007, $110million in 2006 and $67million in 2005.
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including patent, commercial and environmental matters. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
18.Restructuring and Asset Impairment We initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods: the 2001 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan ("Prior Plans"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, due to the then pending divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses, we launched a new restructuring plan ("2005 Plan") to reduce our workforce and facility footprint to match a smaller organizational size. The workforce reduction portion of our plans are now substantially complete. However, charges in connection with the consolidation of excess facilities continue to be recorded due to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the date the liability for the excess facility was recorded. Payments will continue to be made related to these properties over the next four years.
105 A summary of total restructuring activity, including that classified as discontinued operations, is shown in the table below: Workforce Reduction Consolidation of Excess Facilities Impairments Total (in millions) Balance as of October 31, 2004 $ 21 $ 66  $ 87 Income statement expense 106 10 7 123 Asset impairments   (7 ) (7 ) Cash payments (83 ) (27 )  (110 ) Balance as of October 31, 2005 $ 44 $ 49  $ 93 Income statement expense 111 33 42 186 Asset impairments   (42 ) (42 ) Cash payments (142 ) (24 )  (166 ) Balance as of October 31, 2006 $ 13 $ 58  $ 71 Income statement expense 17 (5 )  12 Asset impairments     Cash payments (29 ) (22 )  (51 ) Balance as of October 31, 2007 $ 1 $ 31  $ 32 The restructuring accrual for all plans, which totaled $32million at October31, 2007 and $71million at October31, 2006, is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and represents estimated future cash outlays. Workforce reduction activities were substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2007, with an anticipated further $1million to be incurred in 2008 as the final participants leave the company. In 2006, we consolidated several facilities due to changes in our organizational structure and recorded impairment charges of $42million. These charges were primarily associated with facilities located in Germany and the US. In 2007, we saw a slight improvement in our assessments of potential recoveries from sub-lease tenants in some of our vacant properties and consequently we released $5million of our accrual, on a net basis.
A summary of the statement of operations impact of the charges resulting from all restructuring plans is shown below: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Cost of products and services $ 6 $ 28 $ 35 Research and development 1 21 19 Selling, general and administrative 5 123 54 Restructuring and asset impairment charges included in continuing operations 12 172 108 Restructuring and asset impairment charges included in discontinued operations, semiconductor products business   10 Restructuring and asset impairment charges included in discontinued operations, semiconductor test solutions business  14 5 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 12 $ 186 $ 123 106 19.Senior Notes, Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities Senior Notes In October2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.60% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on November1, 2017, bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum, payable semi-annually on May1 and November1 of each year, commencing on May1, 2008. The senior notes are unsecured and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Agilent's other senior unsecured indebtedness. The company incurred issuance costs of $5million in connection with the senior notes which have been included in "Other assets" in the consolidated balance sheet. These debt issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes.
Upon the closing of the offering of the senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600million. Under the interest rate swaps, we will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the six month US dollar LIBOR. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate. The swaps are accounted for as a fair value hedge of the interest rate risk inherent in the senior notes and therefore the fair value of the swap will be recorded on our balance sheet at each period end until maturity in 2017. In addition, as a result of the fair value hedge, the senior notes are reflected on our balance sheet at fair value, reflecting the change in their value attributable to interest rate risk. The hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness, and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes. At October31, 2007, the fair value of the swap was a liability of $11million. As a result, the carrying value of the senior notes at October31, 2007 was reduced by $11million to reflect their reduced fair value.
Long-Term Debt In January2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade,Inc., a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent ("World Trade"), entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with a counterparty pursuant to which World Trade sold 15,000 ClassA preferred shares of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries to a counterparty, having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5billion (the "Purchased Securities"). Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the counterparty those preferred shares for 100percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January2011. The $1.5billion obligation of our subsidiary to repurchase the preferred shares has been treated as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The related debt issuance costs of $25million were deferred and recognized in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized over the life of the Repurchase Agreement.
Under the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the counterparty at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 28 basis points. Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade. The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default but no financial covenants. Under the Repurchase Agreement, our subsidiary has the right to accelerate the repurchase of all or any portion of the preferred shares prior to January2011.
107 In connection with the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade's wholly owned subsidiary is required to hold restricted cash or investments. As of October31, 2007, the balance was $1,580million and was classified within restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note10, "Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents." Credit Facilities On May11, 2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300million unsecured credit facility that will expire on May11, 2012. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. To date the company has not borrowed under the facility, but may borrow from time to time as necessary.
In December2005, we drew down $700million on a $1billion senior secured term borrowing facility to help finance our share repurchase program. The term facility allowed us a one-time borrowing at an interest rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points per annum. In January2006, we applied $700million of the proceeds from the Repurchase Agreement to repay the full amount borrowed under the secured term borrowing facility. Total interest expense on the senior secured term borrowing facility was $3.6million. The senior secured term borrowing facility expired in the first quarter of 2006.
20.Stock Repurchase Program As of October31, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized stock repurchase programs of up to $6.466billion of our common stock. As of October31, 2007, we had repurchased a total of approximately 181million shares of our common stock for $6.466billion. In addition, we capitalized $3million of service and legal fees. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.

We are a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. During 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products 108 business and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business. Following this re-organization, Agilent has two businesses bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement each of which comprises a reportable segment. In the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, we moved the nanotechnology measurement business from the electronics measurement segment to the bio- analytical measurement segment to more closely align with the new materials sciences business in that segment. All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this change in reportable segments. The segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Other factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels, were also considered in determining our reportable segments.
A description of our two reportable segments is as follows:  Bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our twelve key product categories include: gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, microfluidics, microarrays, atomic force microscopy, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) instrumentation, software and informatics, and related bioreagents, consumables and services.
Electronic measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems, monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications networks and services, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.
Segment revenue and profit.
The accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are generally the same as those described in Note1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies".
A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include costs of centralized research and development, legal, accounting, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. Corporate charges previously allocated to our semiconductor products business and semiconductor test solutions business, but not classified within discontinued operations, were not reallocated to our other segments. These charges are presented below as a component of the reconciliation between the segments' income from operations and Agilent's income from continuing operations before taxes and equity income and are classified as unallocated semiconductor products business corporate charges and unallocated semiconductor test solutions business corporate charges.
The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. These results are not in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. For example, share-based compensation, restructuring, and other items are excluded from the 109 segment measure of income from operations. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including adjusted income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.
The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, amortization and impairment of other intangibles and other items as noted in the reconciliation below.
Bio-analytical Measurement Electronic Measurement Total Segments Year ended October 31, 2007: Total net revenue $ 2,005 $ 3,415 $ 5,420 Income from operations $ 381 $ 477 $ 858 Depreciation expense $ 44 $ 98 $ 142 Year ended October 31, 2006: Total net revenue $ 1,671 $ 3,302 $ 4,973 Income from operations $ 266 $ 453 $ 719 Depreciation expense $ 40 $ 101 $ 141 Year ended October 31, 2005: Total net revenue $ 1,518 $ 3,168 $ 4,686 Income from operations $ 223 $ 334 $ 557 Depreciation expense $ 37 $ 98 $ 135 The following table reconciles segment results to Agilent's total enterprise results from continuing operations before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Total reportable segments' income from operations $ 858 $ 719 $ 557 Restructuring and asset impairment (38 ) (172 ) (108 ) Gain on sale of assets 9 121  Stock-based compensation (139 ) (94 )  Amortization of intangibles (40 ) (24 ) (13 ) Retirement plans net curtailment and settlement  23  Interest Income 172 178 72 Interest Expense (91 ) (69 ) (27 ) Other income (expense), net 5 54 30 Unallocated semiconductor products business corporate charges  (14 ) (132 ) Unallocated semiconductor test solutions business corporate charges  (42 ) (64 ) Unallocated corporate charges and other (66 ) (53 ) (24 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes and equity income, as reported $ 670 $ 627 $ 291 110 Major customers.

World Trade Share Repurchase Amendment On December7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade entered into an amendment to the Repurchase Agreement among Agilent, Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation ("Merrill Lynch") and World Trade (the "Related Agreement"). As provided in the Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the Counterparty at a rate per annum equal to either (i)the cost of funds to the Counterparty plus 20 basis points, or (ii)three-month LIBOR plus 52 basis points. Also, at any time after February5, 2008, Merrill Lynch may require that World Trade accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities to a date designated by Merrill Lynch that is no earlier than 120days from the date that Merrill Lynch provides notice. The Related Agreement also includes an acceleration clause which allows flexibility for World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities, upon proper notification, when we deem it is appropriate.
We entered into the Related Agreement to retain flexibility and have several options available to us, but at the same time are required under GAAP to reclassify the $1.5billion obligation of World Trade to short term debt subsequent to the execution of the Related Agreement. The maturity date of the obligation will remain as January2011. We also plan to reclassify our related restricted cash of $1,580million as a current asset.

Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October31, 2007.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
