This instrumentation is either used in static or mobile laboratories. Customers include local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies and health laboratories.
The Bioagriculture and Food Safety Market.
Food safety industries apply the same general technologies for chemical analysis as the pharmaceutical and environmental markets, including gas and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. For example, our mass spectrometer portfolio, including triple quad liquid chromatography mass spectrometers, is used to analyze contaminants and residual pesticides in food. There is a significant food safety market involved in analyzing food for pathogen contamination, accurate verification of species type and evidence of genetically modified content. This testing is primarily done via PCR amplification of nucleic acid followed by electrophoresis, real time fluorescent or microarray detection. Additionally, bioagriculture industries seek to improve crops and foods by conducting research on these organisms, as well as testing for genetically modified content, using microarray and microfluidics solutions.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Products A key factor in all of our bio-analytical measurement target markets is the need for new products that increase customer productivity and provide high quality data that enable decision-making by our customers. Our key product segments include: Liquid Chromatography Products A liquid chromatograph ("LC") or a high performance liquid chromatograph ("HPLC") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. Used when sample vaporization is not an option, LC also separates and detects compounds to determine molecular identity and quantity. Our LC instruments are modular in construction and can be configured to form instruments that perform specific analyses. Agilent's HPLC system, the Agilent 1100 Series, has sold over 60,000 systems since its introduction, and in 2006 was replaced by its successor, the advanced 1200 Series Rapid Resolution Liquid Chromatography ("RRLC") System. The 1200 Series is highly flexible, known for its unique capability to switch between ultra high-performance liquid chromatography ("UHPLC") capability of RRLC mode and conventional HPLC mode. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns and ongoing product enhancements. In fiscal 2009 we introduced the 1290 Infinity Liquid Chromatography System, designed to deliver significantly greater power, speed and sensitivity for enhanced performance in the UHPLC market. Our leading edge innovation, HPLC-Chip, is fully commercialized and expanding demand for nano LC solutions across many markets. In fiscal 2009 we introduced a new HPLC-Chip that dramatically simplifies the analysis of phosphopeptides in proteomics research. The Phosphochip is used with Agilent HPLC-Chip/MS instrumentation to identify post-translational modifications ("PTMs") as part of regulating biological pathways.
Gas Chromatography Products Agilent is the world's leading provider of gas chromatographs, both laboratory and portable models. A gas chromatograph ("GC") is used to separate any gas, liquid or solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. We continue to expand the application space for our GCs with the development of new separation columns and product enhancements. Over the last three years, Agilent has introduced updated and advanced models of all of its major gas chromatography platforms, including the launch of the 7890A Gas Chromatograph which 10 Table of Contents replaced the 6890A, the world's most popular Gas Chromatograph. Our advances in GC Capillary Flow Technology provide an effective alternative to more costly and problematic cryogenic solutions in GCXGC applications, and solve practical data quality and throughput problems for customers. Our acquisition of RVM Scientific in fiscal 2008 added rapid, direct heating/cooling systems for GC that greatly reduces GC and GC/MS analytical cycle times, addressing customers' demand for greater productivity, lower power consumption and a reduced footprint. In fiscal 2009 we introduced the 7693A Series Automatic Liquid Sampler ("ALS"), offering substantial gains in throughput, flexibility, sample-preparation automation and serviceability for the current and previous benchtop model GCs.
Mass Spectrometry Products A mass spectrometer ("MS") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical's molecular mass and ion characteristic patterns of fragment masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing proteins and other biological entities that undergo transformations because it enables the understanding and characterization of their many different states. MS systems are typically used in combination with gas or liquid chromatographs. Agilent's MS portfolio includes instruments built around five main configurations single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight ("TOF") and quadrupole time-of-flight. We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio over the past three years with a focus on reliability, sensitivity and ease of use. In fiscal 2009 we introduced the 6540 Ultra- High-Definition ("UHD") Accurate-Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight ("Q-TOF"), the 6430 triple quadrupole, and the 6230 Accurate-Mass time-of-flight liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer ("LC/MS") systems. These new platforms serve new and growing markets for Agilent.
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Products Agilent is a leading worldwide provider of inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ("ICP-MS") solutions. ICP-MS is an analytical technique used for trace elemental determinations with applications in a number of different fields including drinking water, wastewater, food and life sciences. Agilent's Octopole Reaction System ("ORS") removes interfering species using only inert helium gas, which vastly improves speed and accuracy. A growing trend in the world of elemental analysis has revolved around the speciation of certain metals such as chromium and arsenic. One of the primary techniques to achieve this is to use an ICP-MS in combination with an HPLC. In fiscal 2009 we introduced the 7700 Series ICP-MS trace element analyzer designed for greater performance and ease-of-use, which occupies the smallest amount of bench space of any ICP-MS instrument.
Microarray Products Agilent is a leading worldwide provider of microarray-based, genomics research solutions. Our end-to-end solution includes reagents for sample preparation and microarray processing; hardware for sample QC and high-throughput microarray scanning; 60-mer oligo microarrays on industry-standard 1"  3" glass slides for gene expression; comparative genomic hybridization ("CGH")/Copy Number variation ("CNV") analysis, microRNA, methylation, splice variants, and chromatin immunoprecipitation applications; custom microarray design services; and GeneSpring software products for data analysis.

Special service bundles have also been designed to meet the specific application needs of various industries.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Customers We have roughly 23,000 customers, and during fiscal 2009, no single customer represented greater than 3percent of the net revenue of the business. The bio-analytical measurement business is susceptible to seasonality in its orders and revenues primarily based on U.S. government and large pharmaceutical company budgets. The result is that our first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to deliver the strongest profits for this group. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Sales, Marketing and Support Our sales and support delivery channels are aligned by key markets. We market products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. Additionally, we are optimizing our worldwide distribution capabilities to address high-growth opportunities such as the environmental, food safety and biopharmaceutical markets in the Asia-Pacific region.
We use direct sales to market our solutions to all of our pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical accounts, large- and medium-sized chemical customers and environmental accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, telesales and electronic commerce.
We deliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, telephone support and self-diagnostic services provided over the Internet. We also offer special industry-focused service bundles that are designed to meet the specific needs of hydrocarbon processing, environmental, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical customers to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Manufacturing Our manufacturing supports our diverse product range and customer-centric focus. We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. We selectively use third parties to provide some supply chain processes for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California, Colorado, Texas and Delaware in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in China, Germany, Scotland and Japan. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing and so typically do not maintain a high level of inventory.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Competition The markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition. Our principal competitors in the life sciences arena include: Affymetrix,Inc., Illumina,Inc., GEHealthcare, Life Technologies Corp., Thermo Fisher 13 Table of Contents ScientificInc. and Waters Corp. Our principal competitors in the chemical analysis arena include: Life Technologies Corp., Perkin Elmer Corp., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Fisher ScientificInc. and Varian,Inc. Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Government Regulation The analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis business are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. Therefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, the EPA can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or we could face fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Semiconductor and Board Test Business Our semiconductor and board test business provides standard and customized measurement instruments and systems which enable customers to develop and test state of the art semiconductors, test and inspect printed circuit boards, perform functional testing, and measure position and distance information to the sub-nanometer level.
We employed approximately 700 people in our semiconductor and board test business as of October31, 2009. Our semiconductor and board test business generated $0.2billion in revenue in fiscal 2009, $0.4billion in revenue in fiscal 2008 and $0.5billion in revenue in fiscal 2007.
Semiconductor and Board Test Markets Our semiconductor and board test business primarily serves the following markets: Semiconductor development and test The semiconductor development and test market consists of companies that design, test and manufacture semiconductor devices. Key market segments are semiconductor design companies, semiconductor foundry manufacturers, universities and research companies. Key sub-segments are integrated devices, memory devices and nanotechnology/microelectro-mechanical systems. Customers use our semiconductor parametric solutions to test the electrical parameters of wafers used in the semiconductor business. Our equipment is used to confirm specifications, improve yields and analyze new material properties. The instrumentation used consists of parametric test systems, parametric analyzers and source measure units.
Semiconductor and flat panel display lithography This market consists of companies designing and selling lithography systems to the semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers. The lithography business requires precise positioning for the shrinking semiconductor manufacturing dimensions. Our laser interferometer and nano positioning systems provide precise position or distance information. The Agilent solution is integrated into large lithography systems manufactured and sold by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").
14 Table of Contents Printed circuit board assembly and test Our semiconductor and board test products are used by electronic manufacturing services ("EMS") companies, contract manufacturers and OEMsthat design, test, manufacture, distribute and service printed circuit board products. Printed circuit boards are used in all electronic products with the largest end-user markets being mobile phones, computers/PCs and telecommunications. Our test instruments, systems and software design tools are used to design products for efficient and cost-effective manufacturing, validate product performance in a variety of configurations and environments and to test an electronic device as it if were in use in its final environment.
Semiconductor and Board Test Products Parametric Test Instruments and Systems We are one of the leading suppliers of parametric test instruments and systems which combine hardware technology and customizable system software and are used primarily to examine semiconductor wafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process. The 4070-series and 4080-series are parametric test system families used in manufacturing environments. The B1500-series achieves device characterization in a design and test environment.
In-Circuit Board Test Systems The Agilent 3070 In-Circuit Test ("ICT") system is one of the world's best selling board test systems. The ICT system helps identify quality defects, such as faulty or incorrect parts, that affect electrical performance. This allows early repair of such defects. Agilent recently announced the Medalist i1000 ICT system focused on providing a lower cost test system.
Laser Interferometer Position Measurement Systems Agilent provides precision optical systems that form the basis for our laser interferometry solutions. These systems provide very precise position or distance information for dimensional measurements or motion control. The Agilent solution includes laser heads, optical receivers, sensors and system electronics. Most systems are unique configurations based on customer requirements. Agilent also provides custom design work.
Semiconductor and Board Test Customers We market our semiconductor and board test products to semiconductor design and manufacturing companies, research labs and universities, nanotechnology labs, contract manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, semiconductor lithography original equipment manufacturers and machine tool calibrator OEMs.
We had approximately 1,000 customers for semiconductor and board test products in fiscal 2009. One customer accounted for more than 10percent of net semiconductor and board test segment revenue but less than 10percent of consolidated Agilent revenue. The top three customers collectively accounted for more than 20percent of net revenue of the semiconductor and board test business. The loss of any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the semiconductor and board test segment.
The orders and revenues from the semiconductor and board test markets are seasonal, traditionally marked by lower business levels in the first quarter of the fiscal year, increasing volumes in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year, and fourth quarter volumes somewhere between the second and third quarters.
15 Table of Contents Semiconductor and Board Test Sales, Marketing and Support We have a focused sales strategy with a specialized direct sales force, resellers and manufacturer's representatives. Our direct sales force is predominantly dedicated to semiconductor and board test product line sales only. They focus on identifying the needs of our largest customers. Resellers and manufacturer's representatives assist with integrated solutions and geographical coverage, respectively. The semiconductor and board test solutions require integration of equipment, application services, software and after-sale service contracts.
The sales team works closely with original equipment manufacturers and their semiconductor foundry or contract manufacturing partner. The original equipment manufacturer often specifies the test equipment requirements, however the semiconductor foundry or contract manufacturer will purchase the equipment from Agilent or our channel partner.
Semiconductor and Board Test Manufacturing We concentrate our semiconductor and board test manufacturing efforts primarily on final assembly and test of our products. To maximize our productivity and our ability to respond to market conditions, we use contract manufacturers for the production of printed circuit boards, sheet metal fabrication, metal die-casting, plastic molding and standard electronic components. We also manufacture proprietary devices and assemblies in our own fabrication facilities for competitive advantage. We have manufacturing facilities in California in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Japan and Malaysia.
We generally only manufacture products when we have received firm orders for delivery and do not generally hold large stocks of finished inventory.
Semiconductor and Board Test Competition Our semiconductor and board test business competes with a number of significant competitors in our major product categories and across our targeted industries. Our primary competitors are Keithley Instruments,Inc., OrbotechLtd., Teradyne,Inc., TRI Test ResearchInc., and Zygo Corporation.
Our semiconductor and board test business products compete primarily on the basis of product quality and functionality, as well as performance and reliability.
Agilent Technologies Research Laboratories Agilent Research Laboratories is our central research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with satellite offices in Beijing, China; Leuven, Belgium; and South Queensferry, Scotland. The Research Laboratories create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent's core businesses and expanding Agilent's measurement footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent's businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value.

16 Table of Contents Global Infrastructure Organization We provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. These organizations are generally headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2009, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,200 people worldwide, which includes the Agilent Labs researchers described above.
The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.
Research and Development Research and development ("R&D") expenditures were $642million in 2009, $704million in 2008 and $685million in 2007, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services.
Backlog On October31, 2009, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately $630million, as compared to approximately $610million at October31, 2008. On October31, 2009, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately $380million, as compared to approximately $360million at October31, 2008. Within our semiconductor and board test business our unfilled orders were approximately $40million on October31, 2009 as compared to approximately $60million at October31, 2008. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.
Materials Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, bio-analytical measurement and semiconductor and board test businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a 17 Table of Contents substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.
Environmental Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal, and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.
Some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold.
In addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP's obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.
We are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.
18 Table of Contents We are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.
We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.
International Operations Our net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 67percent in fiscal 2009, 68percent in fiscal 2008 and 66percent in fiscal 2007, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were approximately 13percent in fiscal 2009, 11percent in fiscal 2008 and 10percent in fiscal 2007. Approximately 11percent of our revenue in fiscal 2009 and 12percent in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.
Long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 51percent in fiscal year 2009, 48percent in fiscal year 2008 and 55percent in fiscal year 2007. Approximately 16, 14 and 16percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.
Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note21, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets On July26, 2009, Agilent, Varian,Inc. ("Varian"), and Cobalt Acquisition Corp., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Varian would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. Varian is a leading worldwide supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications. The estimated $1.5billion total purchase price of Varian includes $52 cash per share of Varian's common stock, the cashing out of in the money stock options (after acceleration) and assumed debt. The transaction has been approved by 19 Table of Contents shareholders of Varian and is expected to be completed after achieving customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We may finance the purchase price of Varian using a portion of the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash.

21 Table of Contents Item1A.
Risk Factors Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results Continued depressed general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Worldwide financial markets have experienced extreme disruption in the past year, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades and declining valuations of investments. These disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. We are unable to predict how long the economic downturn will last. A continuing economic downturn and continuing financial market disruptions may adversely impact our business resulting in:  reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;  increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;  reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the U.S.; and  greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.
Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, we experienced weakness in almost all sectors during the year due to declines in market activity caused largely by the continued global economic downturn. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins.
The actions that we are taking to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.
Since December 2008, we have announced and implemented significant restructuring activities in our global infrastructure organization and our semiconductor and board test segment and electronic measurement segment. This restructuring program and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost 22 Table of Contents structure, could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases, and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.
If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.
We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:  properly identify customer needs;  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;  differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;  price our products competitively;  anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and  control product quality in our manufacturing process.
Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("IT") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
23 Table of Contents Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.
Our income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.
Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.
Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  negative consequences from changes in tax laws;  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;  differing labor regulations; 24 Table of Contents  differing protection of intellectual property;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.
We centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.
In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. These financial institutions, generally, have experienced and continue to experience significant adverse effects on their business from the current decline in general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.
Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees, especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts.
The impact of consolidation of competitors in the electronic measurement and life sciences markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business.
The electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, in September 2009, Danaher Corporation announced an agreement to acquire the Life Sciences Instrumentation Businesses from MDSInc. and Life Technologies Corp. Consolidation in the electronic measurement and life sciences industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.
25 Table of Contents Our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in fiscal 2009, we completed a number of acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, in July 2009, we agreed to acquire Varian,Inc. The closing of the Varian acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of antitrust approvals in both the U.S. and the European Union. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions, including the Varian acquisition, and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:  the retention of key employees;  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;  the retention of key customers;  the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and  the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company.
In addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.
A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:  effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.
In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other 26 Table of Contents factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.
If we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our pending acquisition of Varian,Inc., our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.
We may not achieve the desired benefits from our pending acquisition of Varian. In addition, the consummation of the Varian acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of antitrust approvals in both the U.S. and the European Union. While we intend to consummate the Varian acquisition as soon as practicable after such approvals are obtained, there can be no assurance that we will obtain such approvals or satisfy the other conditions to consummation of the Varian acquisition when expected or at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing the acquisition or restrict our ability to realize the expected financial and strategic goals of the transaction.
The acquisition involves the integration of Varian with the rest of our company. If we cannot successfully integrate Varian's operations, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The integration of two businesses that have previously operated separately will be a costly and time-consuming process that will involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:  diversion of senior management's attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel;  the potential loss of key personnel who choose not to join the combined business;  the potential loss of key customers who choose not to do business with the combined business;  the risk of higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products;  difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of facilities, departments, systems, including accounting systems, computer and other technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, including internal accounting controls, procedures and policies;  difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies; and  the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on integration and implementation activities in excess of our current expectations, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from the Varian acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt.
Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of Varian, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited to:  the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected; 27 Table of Contents  the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our bio-analytical measurement business, and we may not experience anticipated growth in that market;  our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the acquisition or liabilities related to the acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;  the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to Varian's products; and  the risk that we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements, to the extent that we incur debt to pay for the acquisition.
As a result of these risks, the Varian acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected cost synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.
Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.
We have agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us, other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.
Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.
28 Table of Contents Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
Our businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
Some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.
We are subject to laws and regulations, and failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with certain customers.
We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.
A number of our products from our bio-analytical measurement business are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products.
29 Table of Contents Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
From time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.
Third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.
Our pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. Intercompany 30 Table of Contents transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.
At the end of our fourth quarter in fiscal 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.5billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. The recent disruptions in the financial markets have, in some cases, resulted in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition. As of October31, 2009, we also had $1.6billion of restricted cash which is invested in a portfolio of highly rated, short term commercial paper. This restricted cash is invested in a diverse portfolio of commercial paper rated A-1+/P-1 with maturities of less than 100days, in each case, at the time of purchase; however, a failure of the issuer of any such commercial paper may result in an adverse impact on the portfolio.
We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
We currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1,350million in senior unsecured notes. We also are a party to a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to $330million. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. We may enter into additional financing arrangements in order to satisfy our $1.5billion repurchase obligation of Agilent Technologies World Trade, which is scheduled to come due in January 2011.
Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:  increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;  requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases; and  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
31 Table of Contents Our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if our long-term leasehold counterparty becomes insolvent and the credit support on the leasehold transaction fails.
In February 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287million in cash. In August 2001, we completed a like-kind exchange by acquiring a long-term leasehold interest in several municipal properties in southern California for a total value of $289million. In 2002, we received $237million in non-refundable prepaid rent related to the leasehold interests described above. We contracted with a third party to provide credit protection for certain aspects of the transaction, including a future bankruptcy of the municipality. The current third party insurer is a subsidiary of American International GroupInc. ("AIG") which has recently experienced a credit rating downgrade by Moody's and Standard& Poor's and has been the recipient of U.S federal government sponsored loans. If the municipality was to become insolvent and the credit support on the transaction was to fail, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.
We have substantial cash requirements in the United States while a majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Although cash generated in the United States covers normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the Varian acquisition, the satisfaction of our $1.5billion repurchase obligation of World Trade scheduled to come due in January 2011, the repurchases of our stock and acquisitions of other third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through (1)the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or (2)other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.
If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.

Legal Proceedings In November 2001, a securities class action, Kassin v. Agilent Technologies,Inc., et al., Civil Action No.01-CV-10639, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court") against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ("IPO"), Agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the IPO. In 2003, the Court granted Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims against Agilent based on Section10 of the Securities Exchange Act, but denied Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims based on Section11 of the Securities Act. On June14, 2004, papers formalizing a settlement among the plaintiffs, Agilent and more than 200 other issuer defendants and insurers were presented to the Court. Under the proposed settlement, plaintiffs' claims against Agilent and its directors and officers would be released, in exchange for a contingent payment (which, if made, would be paid by Agilent's insurer) and an assignment of certain potential claims. However, class certification of plaintiffs' underlying action against the underwriter defendants was a condition of the settlement. On December5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Court's order certifying such a class in several "test cases" that had been selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs. On January5, 2007, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing to the full bench of the Second Circuit. On April6, 2007, the Second Circuit issued an order denying rehearing but noted that plaintiffs are free to "seek certification of a more modest class." On June25, 2007, the Court entered an order terminating the proposed settlement between plaintiffs and the issuer defendants based on a stipulation among the parties. Plaintiffs have amended their allegations and filed amended complaints in six "test cases" (none of which involve Agilent). Defendants in these cases have moved to dismiss the amended complaints. On March26, 2008, the Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. The parties have again reached a global settlement of the litigation and filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on April2, 2009. Under the settlement, the insurers would pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to Agilent, and Agilent would bear no financial liability. Agilent, as well as the officer and director defendants who were previously dismissed from the action pursuant to tolling agreements, would receive complete dismissals from the case. On June9, 2009, the Court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement. Certain objectors are seeking to appeal. It is uncertain whether the settlement will receive final Court approval.
On August5, 2009, a putative class action was filed in California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara, entitled Feivel Gottlieb Plan Administrator Feivel Gottlieb Defined Benefit Pension Plan DTD 01-01-04 v. Garry W. Rogerson, et al., No.1-09-CV-149132. The action was allegedly brought on 34 Table of Contents behalf of a class of shareholders of Varian,Inc. ("Varian") against Varian, its board of directors, Agilent and Cobalt Acquisition Corp. ("Cobalt"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent, in connection with the proposed acquisition of Varian. A similar action, entitled Stuart Kreisberg v. Garry W. Rogerson, et al.
, No.1-09-CV-149383, was filed in the same court on August7, 2009. The actions were subsequently consolidated under the caption In re Varian,Inc. Shareholder Litigation , Lead Case No.1-09-CV-149132, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on August14, 2009. The consolidated amended complaint is also filed on behalf of an alleged class of Varian shareholders against Varian, its directors, Agilent and Cobalt. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that Varian's directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed acquisition and asserts, among other things, that the price and other terms are unfair, that Varian's directors have engaged in self-dealing, and that the disclosures in Varian's August7, 2009 proxy filing are inadequate. Agilent and Cobalt are alleged to have aided and abetted the Varian directors' purported breaches of fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and other relief, including attorneys' fees and costs. On August19, 2009, another substantially similar putative class action, entitled Hawaii Laborers Pension Fund v. Varian,Inc., et al.
, No.1-09-CV-150234, was filed in the same court against Varian, its directors, and Agilent. Like the consolidated amended complaint, it asserts claims on behalf of a class of Varian shareholders, alleges that Varian's directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed acquisition by, inter alia , failing to value Varian properly, agreeing to improper deal terms, engaging in self-dealing and making misleading disclosures, alleges that Agilent aided and abetted those purported breaches of fiduciary duties, and seeks injunctive and other relief (including attorneys' fees and costs). On September25, 2009, the parties signed a memorandum of understanding to settle the class actions. The settlement provides, among other things, that: (i)Varian would make certain agreed-upon disclosures designed to supplement those contained in its definitive proxy statement filed on August20, 2009; (ii)the litigation will be dismissed with prejudice as to all defendants; (iii)defendants believe the claims are without merit and continue to deny liability, but agree to settle in order to avoid the potential cost and distraction of continued litigation and to eliminate any risk of any delay to the acquisition; and (iv)plaintiffs' counsel may seek fees and costs of up to $625,000, subject to court approval. There is to be no payment of money to the alleged class members. The settlement is subject to execution and delivery of a stipulation of settlement and other definitive documentation, confirmatory discovery, the closing of the acquisition, notice to stockholders, and court approval.
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K. This report contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding trends, seasonality, cyclicality and growth in, and drivers of, the markets we sell into, our strategic direction, our future effective tax rate and tax valuation allowance, earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, remediation activities, new product and service introductions, the ability of our products to meet market needs, changes to our manufacturing processes, the use of contract manufacturers, the impact of local government regulations on our ability to pay vendors or conduct operations, our liquidity position, our ability to generate cash from operations, growth in our businesses, our investments, the potential impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, our financial results, our purchase commitments, our contributions to our pension plans, the selection of discount rates and recognition of any gains or losses for our benefit plans, our cost-control activities, savings and headcount reduction recognized from our restructuring programs, the closing of the proposed Varian transaction, our stock repurchase program, our transition to lower-cost regions, the existence, length or timing of an economic recovery that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item1A and elsewhere in this Form10-K.
Revisions to Financial Statement Presentation.
We have revised our consolidated balance sheet as of October31, 2008 to correct an error in the classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities. This revision does not impact the consolidated statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows for any period. During the April30, 2009 quarter-end process, we noted that the October31, 2008 U.S. deferred tax valuation allowances and certain deferred tax assets/ deferred tax liabilities were misclassified on the balance sheet as a result of improperly applying the jurisdictional netting rules. We have therefore revised our balance sheet as of October31, 2008 by decreasing other long-term liabilities by $435million and decreasing other long-term assets by $404million, decreasing other current assets by $26million and increasing other accrued liabilities by $5million.
FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") introduced the "FASB Accounting Standards Codification" and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles", ("The Codification or ASC"). The Codification, which was launched on July1, 2009, became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S.GAAP, superseding existing literature issued by FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force and other related literature. The Codification eliminates the GAAP hierarchy and establishes one level of authoritative guidance for GAAP. All other literature is considered non-authoritative. The Codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September15, 2009. We have adopted the Codification in the quarter ending October31, 2009 and provided the appropriate references to the Codification, where appropriate. There has been no change to our financial statements due to the implementation of the Codification.
Overview and Executive Summary Agilent is the world's premier measurement company, providing core electronic and bio-analytical measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.
39 Table of Contents In the first fiscal quarter of 2009, we formed a new operating segment from our existing businesses: the semiconductor and board test segment. The new segment covers semiconductor equipment and services sold to semiconductor manufacturing and printed circuit board assembly customers. In addition, in the first quarter of 2009, we moved microscopy measurement from the bio-analytical measurement segment to the electronic measurement segment. All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements.
The Agilent business is comprised of the electronic measurement business, the bio-analytical measurement business and the semiconductor and board test business. Our fiscal year end is October31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
Agilent's net revenue in 2009 was $4,481million, a decrease of 22percent when compared to 2008. Foreign currency movements accounted for 2percentage points of revenue decline in 2009 compared to 2008. Bio-analytical measurement revenues decreased 6percent in 2009 compared to last year with foreign currency movements accounting for 4percentage points of revenue decline. Within bio-analytical measurement, life sciences revenues declined 5percent in 2009 compared to 2008 with declines in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets and a modest increase in demand within the academic and government research markets. Also within bio-analytical measurement, chemical analysis revenues declined 7percent compared to 2008 with the food safety market showing strength throughout the year, but other markets down compared to last year. Electronic measurement revenues decreased 30percent in 2009 when compared to 2008. Within electronic measurement, revenues in general purpose test decreased 23percent when compared to last year with aerospace and defense markets declining moderately and semiconductor related markets remaining depressed. Also within electronic measurement, communications test markets were particularly weak and fell 39percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Our semiconductor and board test business continued to experience depressed market conditions in 2009 and revenue declined 54percent compared to 2008. Agilent's total net revenue in 2008 increased 7percent in comparison to 2007. Foreign currency movements accounted for 3percentage points of revenue growth in 2008 when compared to 2007 and a further 1percentage point increase in revenue was attributable to acquisitions in 2008 when compared to 2007.
Net loss was $31million in 2009 and net income of $693million in 2008 and $638million in 2007. In 2009, 2008 and 2007 we generated operating cash flows of $408million, $756million and $969million, respectively. As of October31, 2009 and 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $2,479million and $1,405million, respectively.
We announced restructuring activities in December 2008, February 2009 and March 2009 in response to the deterioration of economic conditions. The restructuring activities were combined under a single restructuring plan (the "FY 2009 Plan") and are part of a series of actions taken by Agilent in response to the current economic situation. In connection with the combined restructuring plan, we expect to record in aggregate approximately $315million in pre-tax restructuring and other charges related to business and infrastructure cost reduction. Total restructuring and other special charges of $267million have been incurred in the year ended October31, 2009 with respect to these actions. A significant portion of these charges has resulted and will continue to result in cash expenditures. When completed, these actions together are expected to result in future annual operating savings of approximately $525million and workforce reductions of approximately 3,800 regular positions. We completed the majority of these activities related to the FY 2009 Plan by October31, 2009 with the remainder expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010. As of October31, 2009 approximately 600 employees within electronic measurment are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan.
40 Table of Contents On July26, 2009, Agilent, Varian,Inc. ("Varian"), and Cobalt Acquisition Corp., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Varian would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. Varian is a leading worldwide supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications. The estimated $1.5billion total purchase price of Varian includes $52 cash per share of Varian's common stock, the cashing out of in the money stock options (after acceleration) and assumed debt. The transaction has been approved by shareholders of Varian and is expected to be completed after achieving customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We may finance the purchase price of Varian using a portion of the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash.
On October30, 2009 we completed the sale of our Data Networks Product Line ("DNPL") to Ixia (Nasdaq: XXIA) for $44million in cash. DNPL comprises the N2X family of products for next-generation internet protocol ("IP") performance testing. Ixia is a leading provider of converged IP performance test systems and service verification platforms for wireless and wired infrastructures. We recorded the gain on this divestiture in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Looking forward, we have seen signs that our businesses may have reached the bottom of the economic downturn. We remain committed to delivering performance consistent with Agilent's operating model. We have announced that starting in the first quarter of 2010, Agilent will report in the following three segments: electronic measurement, chemical analysis and life sciences. The electronic measurement segment will recombine electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test, which were reported separately in 2009 (see "2010 Segment Reporting Changes").
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue recognition.
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period 41 Table of Contents or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, whether fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition.
Inventory valuation.
We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
Investment impairments.
We recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our equity and debt securities and our cost-method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Share-based compensation.
We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight-line basis. Our estimate of share-based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures and related tax effects. We consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted, which we believe is representative of future behavior. In 2008 and 2007 we used implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded, similar priced stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards. In 2009, we moved to historical volatility of Agilent's stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. A 10percent increase in our estimated volatility from 36percent to 46percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 23percent if no other factors were changed.
In the first quarter of 2009, we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 4.6years to 4.4years. In revising this estimate, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees. In the first quarter of 2009, we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive 42 Table of Contents employees, on average, exercise their options at 4.4years. See Note3, "Share-Based Compensation," to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date October31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve. The discount rate decreased significantly over the prior year from 8.5percent to 5.25percent due to lower bond yields. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.
The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. A one percent change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2009 would result in a $5million impact on U.S. pension expense and a $15million impact on non-U.S. pension expense.
The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were $103million in 2009, $15million in 2008, and $57million in 2007.
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
Agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. We have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes: electronic measurement, bio-analytical measurement, and semiconductor and board test. We test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment, as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the 43 Table of Contents fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which are formed by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization, taking into account an appropriate control premium. We then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair value calculations based on the income approach. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. The assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Changes in these assumptions based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods.
The circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include, but are not limited to, the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test: significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, a portion of a reporting unit's goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value.
We have considered the negative effects of the current downturn in the business environment in evaluating whether we should perform interim goodwill impairment testing. Due to the significant business downturn in the semiconductor and board test reporting unit, we performed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of 2009 and determined that there was no impairment at that time. The results of our test for goodwill impairment, as of September30, 2009, showed that the estimated fair values of our electronic measurement, bio-analytical measurement, and semiconductor and board test reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately $3.0billion, $5.5billion, and $0.2billion, respectively. A 1percent increase in the discount rate lowered the fair value by approximately 14percent. There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended October31, 2009. We continue to assess the overall environment to determine if we would trigger and fail step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We performed an impairment analysis of purchased intangible assets in 2009 and recorded $16million of impairment charges primarily related to divested businesses.
Restructuring and asset impairment charges.
The four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions, the consolidation of excess facilities, asset impairments and special charges related to inventory. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises. These estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance. We have also assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets, by determining 44 Table of Contents whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. Asset impairments primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell. The charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.
Accounting for income taxes.
We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At October31, 2009, we provided partial valuation allowances for our U.S. deferred tax assets and full or partial valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of a valuation allowance in a given taxing jurisdiction.
We have not provided for all U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. If the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated, a material impact on income tax expense could result.
Adoption of New Pronouncements See Note2, "New Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
Restructuring Costs, Asset Impairments and Other Charges In December 2008, we announced the FY 2009 Plan. Initially, we expected to reduce our annual operating expenses by reducing approximately 500 positions of the global workforce of regular employees. In February 2009, we announced we had expanded the FY 2009 Plan to include actions to 45 Table of Contents exit the inspection businesses in our semiconductor and board test segment and to restructure our global infrastructure organization. In March 2009, we announced that the FY 2009 Plan had been expanded further to restructure our electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test segments in response to the continuing deterioration of economic conditions. Under the FY 2009 Plan, we expect to record in aggregate approximately $315million in pre-tax restructuring and other charges related to business and infrastructure cost reduction. We expect that a significant proportion of these charges will result in cash expenditures. When completed, these actions together are expected to result in annual operating savings of approximately $525million and workforce reductions of approximately 3,800 regular positions.
Total restructuring and other special charges of $267million have been incurred in the year ended October31, 2009 with respect to these actions. Of the $267million, $27million related to asset impairments and $20million related to special charges for excess inventory as a result of exiting the inspection businesses in our semiconductor and board test segment and other excess inventory charges incurred as part of our restructuring of the electronic measurement businesses. We completed the majority of these activities related to the FY 2009 Plan by October31, 2009 with the remainder expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010. As of October31, 2009 approximately 600 employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan. As a result of these actions, the average future working lifetime of the employees remaining in our retirement and post retirement benefit plans decreased and accordingly, we recorded a $16million net curtailment gain in the year ended October31, 2009.
Foreign Currency Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (rolling twelve month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term.

Our bio-analytical measurement business experienced weak market activity and recorded an order decrease of 8percent in 2009 compared to last year. Electronic measurement orders were down compared to 2008 by 28percent with order weakness most pronounced in communications test.
Net revenue in 2009 was $4,481million, a 22percent decrease over the $5,774million net revenue recorded in 2008. Foreign currency movements accounted for 2percentage points of revenue decline in 2009 compared to 2008. Net revenue from services declined 6percent in 2009 versus a 26percent decline in product revenues. Revenue decreased in both bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement when compared to 2008, but there were signs that there was a recovery in a number of end markets towards the end of 2009. Net revenue in 2008 was $5,774million, a 7percent increase over the $5,420million net revenue recorded in 2007. Foreign currency movements accounted for 3percentage points of revenue growth in 2008 when compared to 2007 and a further 1percentage point increase in revenue was attributable to acquisitions in 2008 when compared to 2007.
Services and other revenue include revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting. Services and other revenue decreased 6percent in 2009 as compared to 2008. We saw relative strength in aftermarket services, including service contract activity which contributed to the relative stability in service revenue. Services and other revenue increased 6percent in 2008 compared to 2007.
Bio-analytical measurement revenues decreased 6percent in 2009 when compared to 2008 with decreases in both life sciences and chemical analysis businesses of 5percent and 7percent, respectively. Within life sciences, we saw modest growth in revenue in the academic and government markets, but weakness in pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets. Within chemical analysis, all markets recorded revenue decreases in 2009 when compared to 2008 with the exception of food safety which reported strong results driven by analysis of contaminated foods and worldwide regulatory efforts.
Electronic measurement revenues decreased 30percent in 2009 when compared to 2008 with sustained weakness in general purpose and communication test down 23percent and 39percent, respectively. Within general purpose test, the aerospace and defense market showed signs of recovery toward the end of 2009, but other markets remained difficult and demand declined over the year. Communication test revenues were depressed throughout the year across all markets when compared to 2008.
The semiconductor and board test business reported a decline in revenues of 54percent in 2009 when compared to 2008 as markets declined markedly.
Backlog On October31, 2009, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately $630million, as compared to approximately $610million at October31, 2008. On 47 Table of Contents October31, 2009, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately $380million, as compared to approximately $360million at October31, 2008. Within our semiconductor and board test business our unfilled orders were approximately $40million on October31, 2009 as compared to approximately $60million at October31, 2008. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Costs and Expenses Years Ended October31, 2009 over 2008 Change 2008 over 2007 Change 2009 2008 2007 Gross margin on products 52.6 % 57.7 % 57.2 % (5)ppts 1 ppt Gross margin on services and other 45.7 % 43.5 % 42.8 % 2ppts 1 ppt Total gross margin 51.1 % 55.4 % 54.8 % (4)ppts 1 ppt Operating margin 1 % 13.8 % 10.8 % (13)ppts 3 ppts (in millions) Research and development $ 642 $ 704 $ 685 (9)% 3% Selling, general and administrative $ 1,603 $ 1,697 $ 1,700 (6)%  In 2009, total gross margin decreased 4percentage points in comparison to 2008. The majority of the decrease in gross margins was related to the drop in volume of revenues. Operating margins in 2009 decreased 13percentage points as compared to 2008.
In January 2009, we implemented wage reductions across the company in response to deteriorating economic conditions. Those payroll reductions resulted in cash savings of approximately $70million in 2009 and were fully restored to all employees effective November1, 2009.
Research and development expenditures have decreased 9percent in 2009 compared to 2008. A net decrease in expenses after incurring restructuring costs was attributable to lower variable pay and wage reductions.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6percent during the year. The net decrease in expenses after incurring restructuring costs was due to the expense controls we have implemented, and in particular, lower variable pay, wage reductions and reduced commissions.
Gross inventory charges were $54million in 2009, $24million in 2008 and $21million in 2007. Sales of previously written down inventory were $8million in 2009, $6million in 2008 and $5million in 2007.
Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. We conduct five types of research and development: basic research, which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future; foundation technologies, which enables fundamental advances across all businesses; communications, which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information; life sciences, which enables next-generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes; and measurement, which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems. Our research seeks to improve on various technical 48 Table of Contents competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices, digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies; software, systems and solutions such as applied mathematics, knowledge management and measurement science; life sciences such as computational biology, molecular diagnostics and high-throughput measurements; and photonics, such as precision automation technology, optical switching and high-speed optical links. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20,000 products already in production, other research is on major new product releases, and yet other focused on developing new product segments for the future. Due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense.
Net loss in 2009 was $31million. Net income in 2008 and 2007 was $693million and $638million, respectively.
At October31, 2009, our headcount was approximately 16,800 compared to 19,600 in 2008 and 19,400 in 2007.
Provision for Income Taxes Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 38 $ 122 $ 32 For 2009, the annual effective tax rate was 543percent on operations. The 543percent operations tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results. The tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. In addition, net tax benefits totaling $67million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances. We intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances.
For 2008, the annual effective tax rate was 15percent on operations. The 15percent operations tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the U.S. federal and state valuation allowances which results in U.S. tax expense of nearly zero. It also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Without considering interest and penalties, the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, the U.S., and the U.K. where we have recorded valuation allowances.
For 2007, the annual effective tax rate was 4.8percent on operations. The 4.8percent operations tax rate reflects taxes at an effective tax rate of zero in the U.S. (due to a release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance) and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions. The low operations tax rate includes a benefit of $31million related to valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in other comprehensive income items, portions of which are attributable to increases in currency translation adjustments and to increases in the value of certain stock investments. In addition, the tax rate includes benefits totaling $73million related to the resolution of primarily non-U.S. tax issues associated with the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard.
49 Table of Contents Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $14million, $112million and $190million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.04, $0.30 and $0.47 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. During 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2008, we maintained a partial U.S. federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. In 2008, the valuation allowance increased substantially as a result of changes to other comprehensive income-related taxes for pensions, certain mark to market investments, currency translation adjustments and an increase in the amount of foreign tax credits. During 2009, we continued to maintain the partial valuation allowances for U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. In 2009, the valuation allowance increased over the prior year reflecting an offset of an increase in the gross deferred tax liability for other comprehensive income and the increases of the gross deferred tax assets for losses incurred and other operating timing items. The valuation allowance increases are primarily associated with the U.S. and U.K. We intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of a valuation allowance in a given taxing jurisdiction. Cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence to require maintaining full valuation allowances.
In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2007 have been or are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). In August 2007, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") for 2000 through 2002. The RAR proposed many adjustments to taxable income. One adjustment, however, which deals with the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates accounts for the majority of the proposed adjustments. In August of 2009, this brand name issue was resolved with no adjustments made to Agilent's taxable income. We continue to meet with the Appeals Office of the IRS in order to resolve the remaining issues associated with the RAR's proposed adjustments. We are uncertain as to how and when these issues will be finally resolved. It may take several years. We believe that any required adjustments however will be more than offset by applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits. Based on current information, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
50 Table of Contents Global Infrastructure Organization Our global infrastructure organization ("GIO") remains a key component of our operating model. GIO, which includes IT, Workplace Services, HR, Legal and Finance, has reduced expense levels this year while delivering infrastructure support to business operations. In response to deteriorating economic conditions earlier this year, we announced a GIO restructuring program in February 2009. The results of this program brought GIO workforce to a more appropriate size and structure for the current economic realities of our business. All of the actions associated with the restructuring of our GIO have now been taken and are complete.
Our global infrastructure costs decreased by 12percent year-over-year compared to 2008. GIO passes these costs on to our businesses based on their usage of the services provided. GIO has scaled down its staffing over several years, reducing the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance, IT and workplace services and moved many of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions or external service providers. The global infrastructure organization ended 2009 with approximately 2,200 employees, a decline of 250 employees from one year ago and a decline of 300 employees from two years ago.
Segment Overview Agilent is a measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.
In the first fiscal quarter of 2009, we formed a new operating segment from our existing businesses: the semiconductor and board test segment. The segment covers semiconductor equipment and services sold to semiconductor manufacturing and printer circuit board assembly customers. In addition, in the first quarter of 2009, we moved microscopy measurement from the bio-analytical measurement segment to the electronic measurement segment. All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements.
Electronic Measurement Our electronic measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications networks and services, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment, communications networks and services, and microscopy products. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.
Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October31, 2009 over 2008 Change 2008 over 2007 Change 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Orders $ 2,264 $ 3,148 $ 3,102 (28 )% 1 % Net revenue from products $ 1,836 $ 2,775 $ 2,635 (34 )% 5 % Net revenue from services and other 421 453 456 (7 )% (1 )% Total net revenue $ 2,257 $ 3,228 $ 3,091 (30 )% 4 % 51 Table of Contents Electronic measurement orders declined 28percent in 2009, down from 1percent growth in 2008. Foreign currency movements accounted for 1percentage point of the decline in 2009. In our general purpose test business, weakness in the manufacturing market prevailed through the year, while the computers and semiconductor market was similarly depressed. Aerospace and defense demand was strong relative to other markets and performance was stable on the year. In our communications test business, all end markets declined significantly; however, toward the end of 2009year-over-year rates of decline have slowed or flattened. On a geographic basis, 2009 orders declined 21percent in the Americas, 30percent in Europe, 32percent in Asia and 38percent in Japan. Orders in 2008 grew 1percent compared to 2007 as growth in Europe and Asia was offset by declines in the Americas and Japan.
Electronic measurement revenues declined 30percent in 2009 compared to a 4percent growth in 2008 due to weakness across both general purpose and communications test markets. Foreign currency movements accounted for 1percentage point of the decline in 2009. Regionally, revenues from the Americas declined 28percent, while Europe, Japan and Other Asia declined 31percent, 38percent and 29percent respectively from one year ago. Revenues from services declined only 7percent in 2009 versus a 34percent decline in product revenues. Upfront service and support contracts provide stability in services revenues performance relative to product revenues. Revenue in 2008 grew 4percent compared to 2007 as strength in the communications test market was offset by a slight decline in general purpose test.
General purpose test revenues of $1,369million, representing approximately 61percent of electronic measurement revenues, declined 23percent in 2009 compared to 2008. Within general purpose test, all market segments declined with relative strength in aerospace and defense offset by steeper declines in computer and semiconductor and other general purpose test business. Government demand in aerospace and defense was stable, particularly in homeland security-related applications for surveillance and intelligence. Weakness persisted in the computer and semiconductor measurement markets due to continued capital spending contraction in both R&D and manufacturing applications. Other general purpose test markets were weak with particular softness in electronic manufacturing and automotive markets. Quarterly year-on-year rates of decline in general purpose end markets have slowed in the second half of the year, but revenue remained down significantly from 2008.
Communications test revenues of $888million, representing approximately 39percent of electronic measurement revenues, declined 39percent compared to the same period last year. All communications test end markets experienced double-digit declines compared to 2008. The wireless R&D market, as well as the electronic design automation market, performed better than other submarkets as R&D investment continues for high-speed applications, as well as pre-conformance and interoperability test solutions, particularly for long-term evolution (an emerging wireless standard). Investment in next-generation technology in China increased in the second half of the year. Wireless manufacturing markets declined significantly versus a peak in the second half of 2008 as handset market capacity expansion is limited primarily to smart phones. Capital spending remains limited in the other communications test submarkets. Network equipment manufacturing ("NEM") business declined due to the continued consolidation in the network operator and service provider markets. NEM business remains soft with the majority of investment focused only on critical R&D spending for new technologies, which led to declines in the Broadband R&D and manufacturing market versus a strong 2009year-over-year compare.
Looking forward, while some indications of stabilization and improvement in our electronics measurement markets exist, we expect any recovery to be gradual in the near-term due to on-going market uncertainty.
52 Table of Contents Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the electronic measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2009 versus 2008 and 2008 versus 2007.
Years Ended October31, 2009 over 2008 Change 2008 over 2007 Change 2009 2008 2007 Total gross margin 54.8 % 58.5 % 57.2 % (4) ppts 1 ppt Operating margin 1.7 % 14.0 % 11.0 % (12) ppts 3 ppts (inmillions) Research and development $ 393 $ 461 $ 464 (15)% (1)% Selling, general and administrative $ 806 $ 977 $ 964 (18)% 1% Income from operations $ 39 $ 451 $ 340 (91)% 33% Gross margins for products and services declined 4percentage points year-over-year in 2009 due primarily to the significant decline in revenue volume. Volume-adjusted gross margins compared to 2008 improved as expense reductions from restructuring, lower variable pay, wage reductions, lower general and direct infrastructure costs were offset by the unfavorable impact of higher pension expenses and E&O (excess and obsolescence) inventory charges. Gross margins for products and services improved 1percentage point year-over-year in 2008 as the favorable impact of foreign currency movement and lower overhead costs were nearly offset by changes in product mix and pricing pressure.
Research and development expenses in 2009 declined $68million, or 15percent, compared to 2008. This decline was driven by lower variable pay, wage reductions, savings from restructuring, lower general infrastructure costs and the favorable year-over-year impact of currency movements, which were offset by higher pension benefit expenses. Research and development expenses in 2008 declined $3million, or 1percent, compared to 2007. This decline was driven largely by operational spending reductions that more than offset the unfavorable year-over-year impact of currency movements.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased $171million, or 18percent, compared to 2008. Year-over-year reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses were similar to R&D and were driven by lower variable pay, wage reductions, savings from restructuring, lower general infrastructure costs, reduced commissions and the favorable year-over-year impact of currency movements, which were offset by higher pension benefit expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 increased $13million, or 1percent, compared to 2007. This increase was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movement.
Operating margins declined by 12percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower revenue volume that was partially offset by structural and operational expense reductions. Operating margins increased by 3percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher revenue volume and structural expense reductions.
Income from Operations Income from operations declined by $412million in 2009 compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of $971million, a 42percent year-over-year operating margin decremental as structural and operational expense reductions offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue. Income from operations increased by $111million in 2008 compared to 2007 on a revenue increase of $137million, 53 Table of Contents an 81percent year-over-year operating margin incremental due to structural expense reductions that more than offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movement.
Bio-analytical Measurement Our bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our key product categories include: microarrays, microfluidics, electrophoresis, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, laboratory automation and robotics, spectroscopy, and related consumables, reagents and services.
Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October31, 2009 over 2008 Change 2008 over 2007 Change 2009 2008 2007 (inmillions) Orders $ 2,087 $ 2,275 $ 1,894 (8)% 20% Net revenue from products $ 1,617 $ 1,742 $ 1,486 (7)% 17% Net revenue from services and other 446 453 390 (2)% 16% Total net revenue $ 2,063 $ 2,195 $ 1,876 (6)% 17% Order and revenue results for 2009 in bio-analytical measurement were impacted by the significant downturn in the global economy, although the business was able to sustain growth in key markets, including food safety, academic and government.
Bio-analytical measurement orders in 2009 declined 8percent when compared to 2008. We had mixed results across geographies with Americas down 11percent, Europe down 19percent and Asia and Japan both up 11percent when compared to 2008. Foreign currency movements in 2009 accounted for 3percentage points of the decline in orders when compared to 2008. In our chemical analysis business, we continue to see strength in China and food safety markets. In life sciences, we saw sustained demand from academic and government markets, partially offsetting a slowdown in pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets. In 2008, orders grew 20percent when compared to 2007. The Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions contributed 5percentage points of the order growth in 2008, when compared to 2007.
Bio-analytical measurement revenues in 2009 declined 6percent compared to 2008 with declines in both life sciences and chemical analysis end markets. Foreign currency movements in 2009 accounted for 4percentage points of the revenue decline when compared to 2008. Geographically, revenues were down 9percent in the Americas, 15percent in Europe, and up 9percent in Asia in 2009 compared to 2008. Net revenue from services declined only 2percent in 2009 versus a 7percent decline in product revenues. In services, expansion in Asia and relative strength in aftermarket services, including service contract activity, contributed to the stability. In 2008, bio-analytical revenues grew 17percent compared to 2007, with strength across most end markets in chemical analysis and life science, favorable impact from foreign currency movements, and growth from the Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions.
Chemical analysis revenue, representing approximately 53percent of the bio-analytical measurement segment, declined 7percent to $1,094million in 2009 compared to 2008. Chemical analysis saw declines in petrochemical, environmental, forensics, while the food safety market had 54 Table of Contents robust growth in 2009. Macro-economic conditions worldwide led to reduced capital investments in both instrument replacements and upgrades. Food testing posted strong revenue growth in 2009. Growth in this sector was driven by recent food safety issues in the U.S. causing updated regulations in China, Malaysia and India and by overall increases made to regulatory standards worldwide.
Life science revenue, representing approximately 47percent of the bio-analytical measurement segment, declined 5percent to $969million in 2009 compared to 2008. In 2009, we experienced year-over-year declines in the pharmaceutical and biotech markets but modest year-over-year growth in the academic and government markets. We continue to see academic research moving toward the use of high-end mass spectrometry instrumentation to answer complex biological questions and enhance research on proteins, peptides, and small molecules. The market continues to partner and collaborate between not-for-profit organizations and big pharmaceutical and biotech companies. In Asia Pacific, governments are investing in the modernization of their healthcare systems and in improving the quality of pharmaceuticals they produce.
Looking forward, we expect modest growth in our major markets. Our chemical analysis market growth is expected to be driven by investments in food safety on a global basis and in environmental testing in China, India and selected Eastern European countries. Our liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy ("LC/MS") and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy ("GC/MS") systems are well positioned to address these market needs. In life sciences, our differentiated product portfolio provides customers an expanded range of technology offerings along the life sciences workflow. Workflow solutions can span from sample delivery and preparation through sample measurement to data analysis and management. In addition, our ongoing expansion of the LC/MS portfolio, augmented with focused R&D programs will enable Agilent to address the proteomics and metabolomics market needs.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the bio-analytical measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2009 versus 2008, and 2008 versus 2007.
Years Ended October31, 2009 over 2008 Change 2008 over 2007 Change 2009 2008 2007 Total gross margin 54.3 % 53.8 % 53.4 %   Operating margin 18.9 % 18.7 % 16.4 %  2 ppts (inmillions) Research and development $ 181 $ 188 $ 153 (4)% 22% Selling, general and administrative $ 549 $ 584 $ 542 (6)% 8% Income from operations $ 390 $ 410 $ 307 (5)% 33% Gross margins were relatively flat in 2009 compared to 2008, as lower volume and higher discounts, were offset by lower variable pay, wage reductions, lower global infrastructure costs and favorable currency movements. Gross margins were also flat in 2008 compared to 2007 as improvements in product mix and overhead costs were offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements and competitive pressures.
Research and development expenses declined 4percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was also driven by lower variable pay, wage reductions, lower global infrastructure costs and favorable foreign currency movements. Research and development expenses grew 22percent in 2008, compared 55 Table of Contents to 2007. The Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions accounted for 13percentage points of this growth in 2008 compared to 2007.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 6percent in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline was driven by lower variable pay, wage reductions, lower global infrastructure costs and foreign currency movements. Selling, general and administrative increased 8percent in 2008 compared to 2007. The Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions accounted for 8percentage points of this growth in 2008 compared to 2007.
Operating margins were flat in 2009 compared to 2008. Wage reductions and lower variable pay helped offset lower sales volumes. Operating margins increased by 2percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007. This was due to higher revenues and operational efficiencies offsetting the higher investments made in research and development and selling, general, and administrative to accommodate growth.
Income from Operations Income from operations in 2009 declined by $20million or 5percent compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of $132million, a 15percent year-over-year operating margin decremental. Income from operations in 2008 increased by $103million or 33percent compared to 2007 on a revenue increase of $319million, a 32percent year-over-year operating margin incremental.
Semiconductor and Board Test Our semiconductor and board test business provides standard and customized laser interferometer, parametric and manufacturing test and measurement instruments and systems monitoring, management and optimization tools that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of semiconductor and printed circuit assembly fabrication. The laser interferometer business was formerly part of the bio-analytical measurement segment and both the parametric test and printed circuit test businesses were formerly part of the electronic measurement segment. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.
Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October31, 2009 over 2008 Change 2008 over 2007 Change 2009 2008 2007 (inmillions) Orders $ 135 $ 327 $ 445 (59)% (26)% Net revenue from products $ 113 $ 287 $ 384 (61)% (25)% Net revenue from services and other 48 64 69 (25)% (7)% Total net revenue $ 161 $ 351 $ 453 (54)% (23)% Semiconductor and board test orders declined 59percent in 2009, down from a 26percent decline in 2008. On a regional basis, 2009 orders declined 62percent in the Americas, 54percent in Europe, 64percent in Japan and 56percent in rest of Asia.
Semiconductor and board test revenues declined 54percent in 2009, down from a 23percent decline in 2008 as all markets and geographies weakened markedly. Capital spending was depressed in 56 Table of Contents all markets due to low capacity utilization in both electronic manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication facilities.
The electronic manufacturing market remains under significant pressure due to the global decline in demand for consumer electronics and market uncertainty. While contract manufacturers have seen capacity utilization rates increase slightly, production line expansion is minimal. The semiconductor fabrication market remains soft as global semiconductor demand continues to be down on weak demand for wireless and computing devices. In addition, semiconductor equipment supplier demand is weak as semiconductor fabrication utilization rates are improving, but still remain low. Demand for parametric test applications and solutions continue to be soft.
Looking forward, we expect near-term weakness in our semiconductor and board test business due to the current market uncertainty and volatility with gradual improvement longer term.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the electronic measurement business's margins, expenses and income (loss) from operations for 2009 versus 2008 and 2008 versus 2007.
Years Ended October31, 2009 over 2008 Change 2008 over 2007 Change 2009 2008 2007 Total gross margin 35.3 % 49.5 % 54.6 % (14) ppts (5) ppts Operating margin (23.5 )% 7.4 % 15.6 % (31) ppts (8) ppts (in millions) Research and development $ 32 $ 49 $ 57 (34)% (15)% Selling, general and administrative $ 63 $ 99 $ 119 (36)% (17)% Income (loss) from operations $ (38 ) $ 26 $ 71 (246)% (63)% Gross margins for products and services declined 14percentage points year-over-year in 2009 due primarily to the significant decline in revenue volume. Volume-adjusted gross margins in 2009 compared to 2008 improved as expense reductions from savings due to restructuring, lower variable pay, wage reductions, lower general and direct infrastructure costs were offset by the unfavorable impact of higher pension expenses and E&O (excess and obsolescence) inventory charges. Gross margins for products and services declined 5percentage points year-over-year in 2008 due largely to the decline in revenue volume.
Research and development expenses in 2009 declined $17million, or 34percent, compared to 2008. This decline was driven by lower variable pay, wage reductions, savings due to restructuring, and lower general infrastructure costs, which were offset by higher pension expenses. Research and development expenses in 2008 declined $8million, or 15percent, compared to 2007. This decline was driven largely by structural and operational spending reductions.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased $36million, or 36percent, compared to 2008. Year-over-year reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses were consistent with R&D and were driven by lower variable pay, wage reductions, savings due to restructuring, and lower general infrastructure costs, which were offset by higher pension expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 declined $20million, or 17percent, compared to 2007. This decrease was driven largely by structural and operational spending reductions.
57 Table of Contents Operating margins declined by 31percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower revenue volume that was partially offset by structural and operational expense reductions. Operating margins decreased by 8percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower revenue volume.
Income from Operations Income from operations declined by $64million in 2009 compared to 2008 on a revenue decrease of $190million, a 34percent year-over-year operating margin decremental as structural and operational expense reductions partially offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue. Income from operations declined by $45million in 2008 compared to 2007 on a revenue decline of $102million, a 44percent year-over-year operating margin decremental as operational expense reductions partially offset the unfavorable impact of lower revenue.
2010 Segment Reporting Changes In the first quarter of 2010, we will form three new operating segments from our existing businesses. The bio-analytical measurement segment will be separated into two operating segments life sciences and chemical analysis. The electronic measurement segment will recombine electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test, which were reported separately in 2009. Following this re-organization, Agilent will have three businesses life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement each of which will comprise a reportable segment. The three new operating segments are determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including technology and delivery channels, consumer-specific solutions and specialized manufacturing, are considered in determining the formation of these new operating segments.
The life sciences segment will include DNA microarrays and associated scanner, software, and reagents; microfluidics-based sample analysis systems; liquid chromatography systems, columns and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems; capillary electrophoresis systems; laboratory software and informatics systems; bio-reagents and related products; laboratory automation and robotic systems; services and support for the aforementioned products.
The chemical analysis segment will include gas chromatography systems, columns and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry products; spectroscopy analyzers; software and data systems; services and support for the aforementioned products.
The electronic measurement segment will now include the semiconductor and board test segment by recombining laser interferometer, parametric test and printed circuit board manufacturing test equipment.
All historical segment numbers will be recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements, beginning with our Form10-Q filing for the first quarter of 2010.
58 Table of Contents The following table reflects the restatement of selected financial information of our operating segments for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 on the new basis: Electronic Measurement Life Sciences Chemical Analysis Total Segments (in millions) Year ended October31, 2009: Orders $ 2,399 $ 1,234 $ 853 $ 4,486 Total net revenue $ 2,418 $ 1,219 $ 844 $ 4,481 Income from operations $ 1 $ 174 $ 216 $ 391 Year ended October31, 2008: Orders $ 3,475 $ 1,313 $ 962 $ 5,750 Total net revenue $ 3,579 $ 1,258 $ 937 $ 5,774 Income from operations $ 477 $ 166 $ 244 $ 887 Year ended October31, 2007: Orders $ 3,547 $ 1,052 $ 842 $ 5,441 Total net revenue $ 3,544 $ 1,046 $ 830 $ 5,420 Income from operations $ 411 $ 123 $ 184 $ 718 Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the U.S. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Agilent has accrued for U.S. federal and state tax liabilities on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Repatriation could result in additional U.S. federal and state income tax payments in future years. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the U.S. and we would meet U.S. liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We utilize a variety of financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
Our financial position as of October31, 2009 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,479million as compared to $1,405million as of October31, 2008.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $408million in 2009 compared to $756million provided in 2008. We paid approximately $113million in taxes in 2009 as compared to $210million in the same period in 2008. Higher tax payments in 2008 were primarily due to one-time taxes related to transfers of intellectual property between affiliated entities. In 2007, we generated $969million in net cash provided by operating activities.
In 2009, accounts receivable provided cash of $193million as compared to cash used of $44million in 2008. Days sales outstanding were 46days in 2009 as compared to 47days in 2008. Accounts payable used cash of $7million in 2009 as compared to cash used of $21million in 2008. Cash provided by inventory was $47million in 2009 compared to cash used of $14million in 2008. Inventory days on-hand increased to 93days in 2009 compared to 89days in 2008.
We contributed $37million and $1million to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We contributed $71million and $43million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2009 59 Table of Contents and 2008, respectively. We contributed $1million and zero to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. Total contributions in 2009 were $109million or 148percent more than 2008. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We increased our contributions to offset significant declines in asset values during 2009. We expect to contribute approximately $86million to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2010.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $14million compared to $399million used in 2008. In 2007, we used $456million of net cash in the investing activities of operations.
Investments in property, plant and equipment were $128million in 2009 and $154million in 2008. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were $1million in 2009 as compared to $14million in 2008. In 2009, we invested $2million in acquisitions and intangible assets compared to $172million in 2008 which was primarily related to our acquisition of Velocity11. In 2007, we invested $344million in acquisitions and purchase of intangible assets. In 2009, we purchased $30million of investment securities as compared to $256million in 2008. Proceeds from the sale of such securities in 2009 were $94million as compared to $150million in 2008. Proceeds from divestitures were $45million in 2009.
We may finance the purchase price of Varian using a portion of the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 was $657million compared to cash used of $774million used in 2008. In 2007, we used $980million in financing activities.
In the first quarter of 2008, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2billion. We repurchased approximately 9million shares for $157million during 2009, based on settlement date, as compared to approximately 30million shares for $1,001million during 2008. On March26, 2009, the company announced that it was suspending its stock repurchase program until the end of the 2009 fiscal year. On November15, 2009, the company's 2008 stock repurchase program expired upon the termination of its two-year term. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans was $71million in 2009 compared to $211million during 2008 and $375million in 2007.
We currently hold $1.5billion of long-term debt that was refinanced on November17, 2008 and the repayment date was extended to January27, 2011. We are currently considering a number of refinancing and other options regarding the long-term debt. On August11, 2008 a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, borrowed a Rupee equivalent of $15million from Citibank N.A at 12.75percent per annum interest rate for 5years, maturing on August9, 2013 to finance a capital project in India. The loan is classified as long- term debt in our consolidated balance sheet.
As of October31, 2009, we had approximately $2.5billion of unrestricted cash and $1.6billion of restricted cash that could be used to repurchase or redeem this long-term debt. However, most of this cash is held overseas and would need to be repatriated to the U.S. in order to be used to satisfy the repurchase obligation. Repatriation could result in additional U.S. federal and state income tax payments in future years.
60 Table of Contents On May11, 2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300million unsecured credit facility that will expire on May11, 2012. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. On September8, 2009, we entered into an Accession Agreement, increasing the credit facility from $300million to $330million. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. As of October31, 2009 the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility.
On August17, 2009 the credit agreement was amended to provide additional financing flexibility in advance of the pending acquisition of Varian,Inc. The amendment allows for up to $1billion of additional indebtedness, incurred during the period from August17, 2009 through the closing of the acquisition, to be excluded from the leverage ratio covenant until the later of the first day of the month following the ninth full calendar month after the closing of the acquisition or August1, 2010; it also temporarily reduces the basket for other secured financing we are permitted to incur from $300million to $75million during this period. The amendment also increases by $500million the amount of repurchase obligations (such as those of Agilent Technologies World Trade,Inc., ("World Trade")), a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, that we are permitted to incur.
On September9, 2009, Agilent Technologies,Inc. entered into an underwriting agreement with Barclays CapitalInc., Citigroup Global MarketsInc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA)LLC. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, Agilent issued an aggregate principal amount of $250million in senior notes (the "2012 notes"). The senior notes were issued at 99.91% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September14, 2012, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.45% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March14 th and September14 th of each year, payments commencing on March14, 2010. Agilent also issued an aggregate principal amount of $500million in senior notes (the "2015 notes"). These senior notes were issued at 99.69% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September14, 2015, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March14 th and September14 th of each year, payments commencing on March14, 2010. Upon the closing of the offering of the 2012 and 2015 notes, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $750million. Under the interest rate swaps, we will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the U.S. dollar London inter-bank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus 257.6 basis points and 253 basis points with respect to the 2012 and 2015 notes, respectively. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note16 "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.
Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
Contractual Commitments Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax 61 Table of Contents and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October31, 2009 for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Operating leases $ 60 $ 84 $ 33 $ 32 Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 456 2   Other purchase commitments 17 24 6 4 Retirement plans 86    Total $ 619 $ 110 $ 39 $ 36 Operating leases.
Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property.
Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 40percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October31, 2009, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was $4million, compared to same amount as of October31, 2008. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
Other purchase commitments.
These relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers. Purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90-day period without significant penalties.
Retirement Plans.
Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans.
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October31, 2009 or October31, 2008.
62 Table of Contents On Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet pertaining to long-term debt (in millions): Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years World Trade debt $  $ 1,500 $  $  Senior notes  251  1,137 Other debt  1 15  Total $  $ 1,752 $ 15 $ 1,137 We have contractual obligations for interest payments on the above debts. World Trade is obligated to make interest payments, reset quarterly, at LIBOR plus 175 basis points. For the Indian Rupee loan from Citibank, the interest rate is 12.75percent. The interest rates for the $600million, $250million and $500million senior notes are 6.5percent, 4.45percent and 5.5percent, respectively. We entered into interest rate swaps for the 2012 and 2015 notes. Under the interest rate swaps for the 2012 and 2015 notes, we are obligated to make interest payments semi-annually, at LIBOR plus 257.6 basis points and 253 basis points, respectively.
As a result of adopting the amended authoritative guidance, $418million of taxes payable are now included in other long-term liabilities as of October31, 2009. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be paid or released.
63 Table of Contents Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 62percent of our revenues in 2009, 65percent of our revenues in 2008 and 64percent of our revenues in 2007 were generated in U.S. dollars.
We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October31, 2009 and October31, 2008, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans as of October31, 2007.
As discussed in Note4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions as of November1, 2007.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
66 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Overview.
Agilent Technologies,Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.
Proposed Acquisition of Varian,Inc.
On July26, 2009, Agilent, Varian,Inc. ("Varian"), and Cobalt Acquisition Corp., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Varian would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. Varian is a leading worldwide supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications. The estimated $1.5billion total purchase price of Varian includes $52 cash per share of Varian's common stock, the cashing out of in the money stock options (after acceleration) and assumed debt. The transaction has been approved by shareholders of Varian and is expected to be completed after achieving customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We may finance the purchase price of Varian using a portion of the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash.
Revisions to Financial Statement Presentation.
We have revised our consolidated balance sheet as of October31, 2008 to correct an error in the classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities. This revision does not impact the consolidated statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows for any period. During the April30, 2009 quarter-end process, we noted that the October31, 2008 U.S. deferred tax valuation allowances and certain deferred tax assets/deferred tax liabilities were misclassified on the balance sheet as a result of improperly applying the jurisdictional netting rules. We have therefore revised our balance sheet as of October31, 2008 by decreasing other long-term liabilities by $435million and decreasing other long-term assets by $404million, decreasing other current assets by $26million and increasing other accrued liabilities by $5million.
Basis of presentation.
The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our fiscal year end is October31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S.GAAP, and has full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, statement of cash flows and statement of stockholders' equity for all periods presented.
Reclassifications.
Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation with no impact on previously reported net income.
FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") introduced the "FASB Accounting Standards Codification" and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles", ("The Codification or ASC"). The Codification, which was launched on July1, 2009, became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S.GAAP, superseding existing literature issued by FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 72 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Emerging Issues Task Force and other related literature. The Codification eliminates the GAAP hierarchy and establishes one level of authoritative guidance for GAAP. All other literature is considered non-authoritative. The Codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September15, 2009. We have adopted the Codification in the quarter ending October31, 2009 and provided the appropriate references to the Codification, where appropriate. There has been no change to our financial statements due to the implementation of the Codification.
Principles of consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Partially owned, non-controlled equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method.
Use of estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue recognition.
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.
We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2)delivery has occurred, (3)the price is fixed or determinable and (4)collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. We consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable, and accordingly we defer revenue until amounts become due. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition.
Product revenue.
Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns, when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete.
73 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence.
Service revenue.
Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer support, consulting, training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized.
Multiple element arrangements.
We use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when delivered elements have stand alone value, fair value of undelivered elements are known and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for the delivered elements. If the criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period(s) over which the last undelivered element is delivered. In the absence of fair value of a delivered element, we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. The price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value.
Deferred revenue.
Amounts billed or collected in advance of the period in which the related product or service qualifies for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.
Accounts receivable, net.
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns.
Share-based compensation.
For the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies,Inc. Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting in accordance with the revised authoritative guidance. Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $71million in 2009, $82million in 2008 and $139million in 2007. In 2007, share-based compensation expense included $15million of incremental net expense associated with the modification of the FY2005 LTPP program. In September 2007 our Board of Directors approved a modification that removed the performance metric from the payout computation for the FY2005 plan only. The modification changed the award payout calculation to be based exclusively on a market performance measure.
Inventory.
Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a 74 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.
Taxes on income.
Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
Warranty.
Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note15, "Guarantees".
Shipping and handling costs.
Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.
We review goodwill for impairment annually as of September30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the authoritative guidance. The circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include, but are not limited to, the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail the first step of the goodwill impairment test (as described in the next paragraph): significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, a portion of a reporting unit's goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value.
The provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. Accordingly, we have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. At the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. For 2009, Agilent had three reporting units, which were the same as our operating segments: electronic measurement, bio-analytical measurement and semiconductor and board test.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment, as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which are formed by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total 75 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization, taking into account an appropriate control premium. We then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair value calculations based on the income approach noted above.
If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its goodwill carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value allocated to goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods.
Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and is amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15years.
Advertising.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $36million in 2009, $45million in 2008 and $48million in 2007 for Agilent operations.
Research and development.
To date, costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.
Sales Taxes.
Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.
Net income (loss) per share.
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. In computing diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds of stock option exercises. The number of shares assumed to be purchased also considers the amount of unrecognized compensation cost for future service. As a result of the company's net loss in 2009, the computation of diluted net loss per share for 2009 excludes the diluted impact of all common stock equivalents outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 excluded the potentially dilutive effect of 29million, 7million and 5million options to purchase common stock, respectively, as their effect was antidilutive.
Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments.
We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
76 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) As of October31, 2009, approximately 53percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S. and 11percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. The remainder is held by other Agilent entities throughout the world. Approximately 5percent of our overall cash and cash equivalents is maintained in demand deposit accounts with global financial institutions of high credit quality and is available to be used in paying and receiving activities. The remainder is invested in institutional money market funds, short-term bank time deposits and similar short duration instruments with fixed maturities from overnight to three months. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds.
We classify investments as short-term investments if their original or remaining maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less.
Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $1.6billion in 2009 and 2008 mostly held in commercial paper.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments.
The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. Agilent determines the fair value of short-term and long-term investments in debt securities considering information obtained from independent pricing sources. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. The fair value of our long-term debt approximates the carrying value. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. See also Note11, "Fair Value Measurements" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.
Concentration of credit risk.
Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits, commercial paper and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. In addition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. Credit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. Credit evaluation is performed by an independent team to ensure proper segregation of duties. No single customer accounted for more than 10percent or more of combined accounts receivable as of October31, 2009.
Derivative instruments.
Agilent is exposed to global market exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options and interest rate swaps to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and 77 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To achieve hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months and interest rate swaps mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions, such as China, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow or net investment hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument is recognized in accumulated comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Amounts associated with net investment hedges are recognized only when the subsidiary is sold or liquidated. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and qualify for net presentation in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was not significant.
Property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We currently use the straight-line method to depreciate assets.
Leases.
We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from one to twenty years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to twenty years.
Capitalized software.
We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years once development is complete.
Impairment of long-lived assets.
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through 78 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Employee compensation and benefits.
Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $133million as of October31, 2009 and $134million as of October31, 2008.
Foreign currency translation.
We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. The cumulative translation adjustment balance at October31, 2009 and 2008 was an unrealized gain of $389million and $232million, respectively.
For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for nonmonetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income (loss). Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and were $1million net loss, $4million net gain and $17million net loss for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
2.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance on measurements of fair value. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S.GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allowed for the delay of the effective date of the authoritative guidance for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for certain items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Effective November1, 2008, we adopted the measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities. The adoption of the guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a material impact on the company's results of operations or the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities. We are required to apply the provisions to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as of November1, 2009 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
On October31, 2007, the company adopted FASB's guidance on defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. This authoritative guidance requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of each plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet with the offsetting change in that funded status to accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon adoption, this guidance required immediate recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income of 79 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/benefits both of which were previously unrecognized. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are eliminated upon adoption of the new standard. As required by the guidance, the company has moved the measurement date for our non-U.S. plans from September30 to October31 effective October31, 2009. The adoption of the measurement provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidation financial statements.
In December 2007, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance for business combinations. The revised guidance provides the recognition and measurement requirements of identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also requires additional disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This guidance is effective beginning November1, 2009, at which time we will change our accounting treatment for business combinations. As a result of adopting the amended guidance on November1, 2009, we did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on non-controlling interests in consolidated financial statements. The guidance requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, and the amount of consolidated net income, be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires once a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. Sufficient disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. It is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008 and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. All other requirements shall be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2008, the FASB issued amendments to provide guidance on an employer's disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The guidance requires detailed disclosures regarding the investment strategies, fair value measurements, and concentrations of risk of plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2009 and will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to provide guidance on variable interest entities. The guidance eliminates a required quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis. It requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary. The guidance will be effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after November15, 2009, and will be applied retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value. The guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, an entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset or, if unavailable, quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar assets when traded as assets. If none of this information is available, an entity should use a valuation technique in accordance with existing fair 80 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) valuation principles. We adopted the guidance in the quarter ended October31, 2009, and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2009, the FASB amended the guidance concerning fair value measurements of investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). If fair value is not readily determinable, the amended guidance permits, as a practical expedient, a reporting entity to measure the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) provided by the investee without further adjustment. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after December15, 2009. We do not expect a material impact on the consolidated financial statements due to the adoption of this amended guidance.
In October 2009, the FASB amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management's best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), vendor objective evidence (VOE) or third-party evidence (TPE) is unavailable. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Full retrospective application of the guidance is optional. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance which amends the scope of existing software revenue recognition accounting. Tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the product's essential functionality would be scoped out of the accounting guidance on software and accounted for based on other appropriate revenue recognition guidance. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Full retrospective application of the new guidance is optional. This guidance must be adopted in the same period that we adopt the amended accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables described in the preceding paragraph. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
3.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Agilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the revised accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values.
81 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Description of Share-Based Plans Employee stock purchase plan.
Effective November1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. Prior to November1, 2008, under the provisions of the ESPP, eligible employees could contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85percent of the lower of the fair market value at the entry date or the purchase date of each offering period, as defined by the ESPP. Effective November1, 2008, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors approved a change to our ESPP that eliminated the look back period. The ESPP will continue to allow eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85percent of the purchase price, but only uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value. As of October31, 2009, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 26,710,768. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of Agilent on November1, or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed 75million shares.
Incentive compensation plans.
On November19, 2008 and March11, 2009, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the "2009 Stock Plan") to replace the Company's 1999 Stock Plan and 1999 Stock Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and subsequently reserved 25,000,000 shares of Company common stock that may be issued under the 2009 Plan, plus any shares forfeited or cancelled under the 1999 Stock Plan. The 2009 Stock Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2009 Plan has a term of ten years. As of October31, 2009, 25,872,956 shares were available for future awards under the 2009 Stock Plan.
Stock options granted under the 2009 Stock Plans may be either "incentive stock options", as defined in Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant and generally have a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted.
Effective November1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP, which is a performance stock award program under the 1999 and 2009 Stock Plans, for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. LTPP awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison set at the beginning of the performance period. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years. The following table summarizes the shares approved by the Compensation Committee to be issued under the LTPP.
Period Approved Target Award Shares Fiscal Year Shares May Be Awarded FY2007 LTPP 447,684 2010 FY2008 LTPP 364,396 2011 FY2009 LTPP 391,868 2012 82 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) In all cases, the final award may vary from zero to 200percent of the target award as it is based on certain performance metrics. We consider the dilutive impact of this program in our diluted net income (loss) per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are met.
In March 2007, we began to issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant.
Impact of Share-Based Compensation Awards We have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the revised authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
The impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Cost of products and services $ 14 $ 17 $ 31 Research and development 11 13 22 Selling, general and administrative 46 52 86 Total share-based compensation expense $ 71 $ 82 $ 139 At October31, 2009 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory. Income tax benefit recognized in 2009, 2008 and 2007 in the statement of operations for share-based compensation was not material. The weighted average grant date fair value of options, granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $5.77, $12.01 and $10.98 per share, respectively.
Included in the 2007 share-based compensation expense amount of $139million is $6million of expense related to the FY2004 LTPP. During 2007, we received the final performance results of our FY2004 LTPP which ended on October31, 2006. The results indicated that we exceeded our specified performance targets. Consequently, we recorded incremental expense to reflect this program's performance results. In addition, in 2007, we recorded $4million of expense for the acceleration of unvested awards related to the separation of a senior executive.
In 2007, share-based compensation expense included $15million of incremental net expense associated with the modification of the FY2005 LTPP. In September 2007, our Board of Directors approved a modification that removed the performance metric from the payout computation for the FY2005 program only which ended on October31, 2007. The modification changed the award payout calculation to be based exclusively on the market metric. The number of shares awarded under the FY2005 LTPP was 200percent of the target award.
83 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Valuation Assumptions For all periods presented, the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For all periods presented, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. As a result of the change in our ESPP effective November1, 2008, no Black-Scholes assumptions were required in the valuation of awards granted under our current ESPP for 2009. For 2008 and 2007 the value of share-based awards for ESPP awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards was determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant.
The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options granted, ESPP purchases and the LTPP were as follows: Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 2007 Stock Option Plans: Weighted average risk-free interest rate 2.31 % 3.16 % 4.61 % Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Weighted average volatility 32 % 33 % 29 % Expected life 4.40 yrs 4.60 yrs 4.60 yrs ESPP: Weighted average risk-free interest rate N/A 2.93 % 4.80 % Dividend yield N/A 0 % 0 % Weighted average volatility N/A 31 % 31 % Expected life N/A 0.5-1 yrs 0.5-2 yrs LTPP: Volatility of Agilent shares 33 % 27 % 31 % Volatility of selected peer-company shares 17%-62 % 17%-52 % 15%-57 % Price-wise correlation with selected peers 35 % 24 % 29 % Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the year 2009 the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of Agilent's stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Management believes that based on current data these estimates of volatility are more appropriate than implied volatility. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered many factors including the limited number of Agilent options currently traded and our limited ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. For 2008 and 2007 we used implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded, similarly priced, stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards. In estimating the expected life of our options granted we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe is representative of future behavior.
In the first quarter of 2009, we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from 4.6years to 4.4years. In revising this estimate, we considered the historical option 84 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) exercise behavior of our employees. In the first quarter of 2009, we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive employees, on average, exercise their options at 4.4years.
Under the anti-dilution provision of the 1999 Stock Plan, on November1, 2006, Agilent adjusted the exercise price downward and number of option shares upward for each outstanding employee stock option to preserve the value of the options after the Verigy spin-off. The impact of the adjusted exercise price and number of options has been reflected in our disclosures as of November1, 2006.

During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative guidance which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction 88 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) basis. During 2007, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. During 2008, we maintained a partial U.S. federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our U.S. state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased substantially in 2008 as a result of changes to other comprehensive income-related taxes for pensions, certain mark to market investments, currency translation adjustments and an increase in the amount of foreign tax credits. During 2009, we continued to maintain partial valuation allowances for U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. In 2009, the valuation allowances increased over the prior year reflecting an offset of an increase in the gross deferred tax liability for other comprehensive income and the increases of the gross deferred tax assets for losses incurred and other operating timing items. The valuation allowance increases are primarily associated with the U.S. and U.K. Cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence to require maintaining full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of a valuation allowance in a given taxing jurisdiction.
At October31, 2009, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $54million. The federal net operating losses expire in years beginning 2015 through 2029, and the federal tax credits expire in 2020, if not utilized. At October31, 2009, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $48million which expire in years beginning 2013 through 2029, if not utilized. In addition, we had state tax credit carryforwards of $43million that do not expire. All of the federal and some of the state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. These annual loss limitations may result in the expiration or reduced utilization of the net operating losses. At October31, 2009, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $489million. Of this foreign loss, $309million will expire in years beginning 2011 through 2018, if not utilized. The remaining $180million has an indefinite life. Some of the foreign losses are subject to annual loss limitation rules.
The authoritative guidance prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits related to stock and stock option plans that have not yet been realized through reduction in income taxes payable. Such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled $149million as of October31, 2009 and will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The differences between profit before tax times the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our provision for income taxes from operations are: Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Profit before tax times statutory rate $ 2 $ 285 $ 234 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 6 5 3 Non-U.S. income taxed at different rates (24 ) (118 ) (109 ) Research credits (7 ) (7 ) (7 ) Hewlett-Packard settlement or spin related   (73 ) Nondeductible goodwill 2   Nondeductible employee stock purchase plan expense 2 3 7 Other, net 11 18 4 Valuation allowances 46 (64 ) (27 ) Provision for income taxes $ 38 $ 122 $ 32 Effective tax rate 543 % 15 % 4.8 % The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) earnings from operations before taxes are: Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) U.S. operations $ (226 ) $ (100 ) $ (460 ) Non-U.S. operations 233 915 1,130 Total income (loss) from operations $ 7 $ 815 $ 670 For 2009, the annual effective tax rate was 543percent on operations. The 543percent operations tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results. The tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. In addition, net tax benefits totaling $67million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate. Without considering interest and penalties, the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances. We intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances.
For 2008, the annual effective tax rate was 15percent on operations. The 15percent operations tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the U.S. federal and state valuation allowances which results in U.S. tax expense of nearly zero. It also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates. Without considering interest and penalties, the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, the U.S., and the U.K. where we have recorded valuation allowances.
For 2007, the annual effective tax rate was 4.8percent on operations. The 4.8percent operations tax rate reflects taxes at an effective tax rate of zero in the U.S. (due to a release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance) and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions. The low operations tax 90 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) rate includes a benefit of $31million related to valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in other comprehensive income items, portions of which are attributable to increases in currency translation adjustments and to increases in the value of certain stock investments. In addition, the tax rate includes benefits totaling $73million related to the resolution of primarily non-U.S. tax issues associated with the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard.
Agilent records U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. As of October31, 2009, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings considered permanently reinvested is $2,983million. The determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings is not practicable. If management decides to remit these permanently reinvested earnings to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.
Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. During the years 2000 through 2009, Agilent enjoyed tax holidays that applied to manufacturing income generated in Malaysia and Singapore as well as income generated from abroad in Switzerland. The tax holiday in Malaysia expires in 2010. In Singapore, three holidays have now expired. However, two of them are currently being renegotiated. In Switzerland, some tax holidays have been renewed with the next one expiring in 2013. Also, Agilent secured in 2004 an additional Singapore tax holiday for earnings from investments and related activity that began in 2004. The tax holiday applies to applicable earnings of Agilent until the end of 2013, with the opportunity for a reduced rate thereafter.
As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $14million, $112million and $190million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.04, $0.30 and $0.47 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. As of October31, 2009, we accrued and reported $41.1million of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits of which $(0.2) million was recognized in 2009.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) A 2009 and 2008 rollforward of our uncertain tax positions including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions is as follows: 2009 2008 (in millions) Balance, beginning of year $ 946 $ 915 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 18 61 Additions for tax positions from prior years 34 20 Reductions for tax positions from prior years (61 ) (41 ) Statute of limitations expirations (7 ) (9 ) Balance, end of year $ 930 $ 946 In the U.S., the tax years remain open back to the year 2000. In other major jurisdictions where we conduct business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003. It is reasonably possible that changes to our unrecognized tax benefits could be significant in the next twelve months due to lapses of statutes of limitation and tax audit settlements. As a result of uncertainties regarding the timing of the completion of tax audits in various jurisdictions and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of increase or decrease that could occur in the next twelve months cannot be made.
Our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2007 have been or are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). In August 2007, we received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") for 2000 through 2002. The RAR proposed many adjustments to taxable income. One adjustment, however, which deals with the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates accounts for the majority of the proposed adjustments. In August of 2009, this brand name issue was resolved with no adjustments made to Agilent's taxable income. We continue to meet with the Appeals Office of the IRS in order to resolve the remaining issues associated with the RAR's proposed adjustments. We are uncertain as to how and when these issues will be finally resolved. It may take several years. We believe that any required adjustments however will be more than offset by applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits. Based on current information, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In connection with the October31, 2006 Verigy distribution, on November1, 2006 Agilent distributed .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of October16, 2006 to Agilent's stockholders. In addition, under the anti-dilution provision of the 1999 Stock Plan, on November1, 2006 Agilent adjusted the exercise price downward and number of option shares upward for each outstanding employee stock option to preserve the value of the options after the Verigy spin-off. For further details on the distribution see Note3, "Share-Based Compensation." The following table presents options to purchase shares of common stock, which were not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share because they were anti-dilutive.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) In 2009, we recorded $5million of goodwill primarily relating to the purchase of the remaining unowned portion of a joint venture. Goodwill was reduced by $22million due to businesses that we divested during 2009 some of which had not been fully integrated into Agilent. We recorded zero additions to other intangibles and recorded $16million of impairment charges to other intangibles primarily related to divested businesses.
In 2008, we purchased $103million of other intangibles and recorded $67million of goodwill relating to seven acquisitions and a purchase of the remaining unowned portion of a joint venture. On December18, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Velocity11, a designer, manufacturer and marketer of robotic solutions. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $111million in cash used to purchase 100percent of Velocity11's outstanding common shares and vested common stock options that Velocity11 employees held on the closing date of the acquisition.
Pro forma disclosures were not required for any of these acquisitions, as they were not material.
Amortization of intangible assets was $45million in 2009, $53million in 2008, and $40million in 2007. Future amortization expense related to existing purchased intangible assets is estimated to be $39million in 2010, $35million for 2011, $28million for 2012, $20million for 2013, $14million for 2014, and $31million thereafter.
10.INVESTMENTS The following table summarizes the company's investments as of October31, 2009 and 2008 (net book value): October31, 2009 2008 (in millions) Short-Term Available-for-sale investments $ 14 $ 24 Long-Term Cost method investments $ 82 $ 68 Trading securities 50 57 Available-for-sale investments 31 81 Total $ 163 $ 206 Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and two special funds and are accounted for at historical cost. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity.
In February 2008, Agilent traded an externally managed short-term investment fund for the underlying securities of the investment and now manages those investments internally. The securities received were fixed income debt securities and are held as available-for-sale. Agilent estimated the fair values based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. These estimated 96 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) fair values may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized as of October31, 2009 and 2008 or that will be realized in the future.
Investments in available-for-sale securities at estimated fair value were as follows as of October31, 2009 and October31, 2008: October31, 2009 October31, 2008 Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value (in millions) Debt securities $ 36 $  $  $ 36 $ 101 $  $ (5 ) $ 96 Equity securities 4 5  9 4 5  9 $ 40 $ 5 $  $ 45 $ 105 $ 5 $ (5 ) $ 105 Contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt securities were as follows at October31, 2009: Cost Estimated Fair Value (in millions) Due in less than 1year $ 14 $ 14 Due in 1-5years 6 7 Due after 5years 16 15 $ 36 $ 36 All of our investments, excluding trading securities, are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Amounts included in other income (expense) for realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other than temporary impairments were as follows: Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Available-for-sale investments realized gain (loss) $ 1 $ (4 ) $ 2 Other than temporary impairment on investments $ (9 ) $ (6 ) $ (7 ) Net unrealized gains and losses on our trading securities portfolio were $6million of unrealized losses in 2009, $15million of unrealized losses in 2008 and $10million of unrealized gains in 2007.
Realized gains and losses from the sale of cost method securities were $1million of realized gains for 2009 and zero for 2008 and 2007.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) 11.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
Fair Value Hierarchy The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
98 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October31, 2009 were as follows: Fair Value Measurement at October31, 2009 Using October31, 2009 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level3) (in millions) Assets: Short-term Cash equivalents (money market funds) $ 1,888 $ 1,888 $  $  Available-for-sale investments 14  11 3 Derivative instruments 14  14  Long-term Trading securities 50 50   Available-for-sale investments 31 9 19 3 Restricted cash (commercial paper) 1,555  1,555  Total assets measured at fair value $ 3,552 $ 1,947 $ 1,599 $ 6 Liabilities: Short-term Derivative instruments $ 8 $  $ 8 $  Long-term Deferred compensation liability 49  49  Total liabilities measured at fair value $ 57 $  $ 57 $  Our money market funds, some publicly traded available-for-sale investments, and our trading securities investments are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level2, as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Most available-for-sale investments as well as our commercial paper are classified as level2 because although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable. Marketable securities measured at fair value using level3 inputs are comprised of asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds within our available-for-sale investment portfolio. The values of these investments are determined based on models for which some of the inputs are not readily observable. Counterparty credit risk is evaluated when assigning levels to our financial instruments.
Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. Investments designated as available-for-sale and certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in earnings.

As part of risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, purchased options, and interest rate swaps, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair Value Hedges The company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure of our debt portfolio to interest rate risk. We issue long-term senior notes in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. We use interest rate swaps to modify the market risk exposure in connection with fixed interest rate senior notes to U.S. dollar London inter bank offered rate ("LIBOR") -based floating interest rate. Alternatively, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest rate or may terminate a previously executed swap. We designate and qualify these interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk inherent in the debt. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, we recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, in interest expense, in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the swaps is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at each period end, with an offsetting entry in senior notes. As of October31, 2009, there were 9 interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges. The notional amount of these interest rate swap contracts, receive-fixed/pay-variable, was $750million.
Cash Flow Hedges The company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period.
100 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Other Hedges Additionally, the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative are recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.
All of our derivative agreements contain threshold limits to the net liability position with counterparties and are dependent on our corporate credit rating determined by the major credit rating agencies. If our corporate credit rating were to fall below the threshold limits, the counterparties to the derivative instruments may request collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of October31, 2009, was approximately $1million. The credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had not been triggered as of October31, 2009.
There were 112 foreign exchange forward contracts and 7 foreign exchange option contracts open as of October31, 2009 and designated as cash flow hedges. There were 147 foreign exchange forward contracts open as of October31, 2009 not designated as hedging instruments.

13.RESTRUCTURING COSTS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES Our 2005 restructuring program, announced in the fourth quarter of 2005, is largely complete. The remaining obligations under this and previous plans relate primarily to lease obligations that are expected to be satisfied over approximately the next two years.
102 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) In the first quarter of 2009, we announced a new restructuring program (the "FY 2009 Plan") to reduce our annual operating expenses by reducing approximately 500 positions of the global workforce of regular employees. The FY 2009 Plan was conceived in response to deteriorating economic conditions and is designed to deliver sufficient savings to enable our businesses to reach their profitability targets. In the second quarter of 2009, we announced additional actions as part of the FY 2009 Plan to restructure our global infrastructure organization and our electronic measurement and semiconductor board test segments in response to the continuing deterioration of economic conditions. These additional actions will ultimately reduce our global workforce of regular employees by approximately 3,300 positions, bringing the total headcount reductions under the FY 2009 Plan to approximately 3,800 positions. We expect to complete all the actions under the FY 2009 Plan by the second quarter of fiscal 2010. As of October31, 2009 approximately 600 employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the FY 2009 Plan.
Special charges related to inventory include estimated future payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers in connection with future inventory purchases and inventory on hand written down. In both cases, actions taken under our FY 2009 Plan, including exiting lines of business, have caused the value of this inventory to decrease below its cost.
A summary of total restructuring activity and other special charges is shown in the table below: Workforce Reduction Consolidation of Excess Facilities Impairment of Building and Purchased Intangible Assets Special Charges related to Inventory Total (in millions) Balance as of October31, 2006 $ 13 $ 58 $  $  $ 71 Income statement expense 17 (5 )   12 Cash payments (29 ) (22 )   (51 ) Balance as of October31, 2007 $ 1 $ 31 $  $  $ 32 Income statement expense  (4 )   (4 ) Cash payments (1 ) (17 )   (18 ) Balance as of October31, 2008 $  $ 10 $  $  $ 10 Income statement expense 202 18 27 20 267 Asset impairments/inventory charges   (27 ) (9 ) (36 ) Cash payments (153 ) (9 )  (10 ) (172 ) Balance as of October31, 2009 $ 49 $ 19 $  $ 1 $ 69 The restructuring and other special accruals for all plans, which totaled $69million at October31, 2009 and $10million at October31, 2008, are recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. These balances reflect estimated future cash outlays.
We expect workforce reduction payments, primarily severance, to be largely complete by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Lease payments should primarily be complete in approximately four years, and payments to suppliers in connection with inventory should be complete by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010.

Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution pension plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits and a death benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan for our eligible U.S. employees.
Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the retirement plan, defined benefits which are generally based on an employee's highest five consecutive years' average pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under our defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993.
In addition, in the U.S., Agilent maintains the Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan ("SBRP"), a supplemental non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the Retirement Plan ("RP") but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the "U.S. Plans".
As of October31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP for U.S. Agilent Employees was $517million and $520million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets.
Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. Our U.S. retirees who retired prior to January1, 2005, are also covered by a lump sum death benefit that is part of the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan. In July 2004, the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan was revised to eliminate the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit for all U.S. retirees who retire on or after January1, 2005. See also Plan Amendments below.
401(k) defined contribution plan.
Eligible U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Enrollment in the 401(k) Plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. Under the 401(k) Plan, we provide matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 4percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation. The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan expense 104 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) included in income from operations was $23million in 2009, $26million in 2008 and $25million in 2007.
Post-retirement medical benefit plans.
In addition to receiving pension benefits, our U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in our Non-Medicare Medical Plan, and if eligible, the Medicare Medical Plan under the Agilent Health Plan. These two plans are (the Post-Retirement Benefit Plans"). Current U.S. employees may become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. Eligible retirees may choose from managed-care and indemnity options, with the company subsidization level dependent on a number of factors including employment status as of January1, 2005, the option chosen, and length of service.
Plan Amendments.
On July14, 2009 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved design changes to Agilent's U.S. Plans. Effective October31, 2009, benefits under the current U.S. Plans formula will be frozen and all future benefit accruals for existing employees and new hires will be calculated under a new formula. The new formula will allocate a percentage of each month's eligible earnings to be payable as a lump sum at age 65 whereas the current formula defines a monthly annuity payable at age 65. In addition, effective November1, 2009, the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan will be discontinued.
Due to these plan amendments, we recorded gains of $117million and $15million in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2009 for the U.S. Plans and U.S. post retirement benefit plans, respectively.
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was passed which expands Medicare to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006. In May 2004, the FASB issued guidance on how companies should account for the impact of the Act on its postretirement healthcare plans. Beginning in 2006, the federal government provides a non-taxable subsidy to employers that sponsor prescription drug benefits to retirees that are "actuarially equivalent" to Medicare PartD benefits. The prescription drug benefits offered under our plans qualify for this subsidy and assuming that we will continue to offer these benefits, we have reflected the expected subsidy according to the guidance prospectively in our financial statements.
Components of net periodic cost.
The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. For Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are 105 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.

Upon adoption, this standard requires immediate recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income of actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/benefits both of which were previously unrecognized. The statement also requires defined benefit plans to be measured at the fiscal year end. The measurement date requirement is effective for this year.
The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net expense during 2010 are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (in millions) Amortization of net prior service cost (benefit) $ (12 ) $ (1 ) $ (14 ) Amortization of actuarial net loss (gain) $ 7 $ 54 $ 16 Investment policies and strategies as of October31, 2009 and 2008.
Plan assets consist primarily of publicly-traded stocks and bonds. In the U.S., our Agilent Retirement Plan and post-retirement benefit target asset allocation is approximately 80percent to equities and approximately 20percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60percent to equities and approximately 40percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 10percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of alternative investments, largely private equity partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. The safety and protection of principal is a primary concern, and we believe that a well-diversified investment portfolio will result in the highest attainable investment return (income plus capital appreciation) with the lowest overall risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation is from 45 to 60percent to equities, from 30 to 55percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 10percent to real estate investments, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified.
Comment on current market conditions.
Due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October31, 2009 and 2008 differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.

The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans October31. For the non-U.S. plans, the measurement date was September30 for 2008. The U.S. discount rates at October31, 2009 and 2008 were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve as well as reviewing the movement of industry benchmarks. The non-U.S. rates were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.
Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 2007 U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 8.5 % 6.25 % 6.0 % Average increase in compensation levels 3.5 % 3.5 % 4.0 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 2.25-6.5 % 2.25-5.9 % 2.25-5.0 % Average increase in compensation levels 2.5-4.0 % 2.5-4.0 % 2.5-4.25 % Expected long-term return on assets 4.5-7.25 % 4.5-7.25 % 4.5-7.0 % U.S. post-retirement benefits plans: Discount rate 8.5 % 6.25 % 6.0 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Current medical cost trend rate 10.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % Ultimate medical cost trend rate 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2018 2013 2012 110 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation were as follows: As of the Years Ending October31, 2009 2008 U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 5.25 % 8.5 % Average increase in compensation levels 3.5 % 3.5 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 2.25-5.75 % 2.25-6.5 % Average increase in compensation levels 2.5-3.75 % 2.5-4.0 % Expected long-term return on assets 4.25-7.0 % 4.5-7.25 % U.S. post-retirement benefits plans: Discount rate 5.5 % 8.5 % Expected long-term return on assets 8.5 % 8.5 % Current medical cost trend rate 10.0 % 10.0 % Ultimate medical cost trend rate 5.0 % 5.0 % Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2019 2014 Assumed health care trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Post-retirement Medical Plans. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates for the year ended October31, 2009 would have the following effects: One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 3 $ (2 ) Effect on post-retirement benefit obligations $ 51 $ (44 ) 15.GUARANTEES Standard Warranty A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December 2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that it might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2009.
Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against certain damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June1, 2006. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2009.
Indemnifications to Hewlett-Packard We have given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP for the businesses that constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. These indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property and environmental matters. The agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on FormS-1 filed on August16, 1999. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2009.
Indemnifications to Officers and Directors Our corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these obligations was not material on the consolidated balance sheet as of October31, 2009.
112 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Other Indemnifications As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October31, 2009.
In connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such business, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2009.
16.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Lease Commitments: We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases at October31, 2009 were $60million for 2010, $51million for 2011, $33million for 2012, $19million for 2013, $14million for 2014 and $32million thereafter. Future minimum sublease income under leases at October31, 2009 was $3million for 2010, $2million for 2011, $2million for 2012, $1million for 2013 and zero thereafter. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense, including charges relating to the consolidation of excess facilities was $95million in 2009, $89million in 2008 and $73million in 2007.
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including patent, commercial and environmental matters. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
17.SHORT-TERM DEBT On May11, 2007, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300million unsecured credit facility that will expire on May11, 2012. On September8, 2009, we entered into an Accession Agreement, increasing the credit facility from $300million to $330million. The company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. As of October31, 2009 the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility.
On August17, 2009 the credit agreement was amended to provide additional financing flexibility in advance of the pending acquisition of Varian,Inc. The amendment allows for up to $1billion of 113 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) additional indebtedness, incurred during the period from August17, 2009 through the closing of the acquisition, to be excluded from the leverage ratio covenant until the later of the first day of the month following the ninth full calendar month after the closing of the acquisition or August1, 2010; it also temporarily reduces the basket for other secured financing we are permitted to incur from $300million to $75million during this period. The amendment also increases by $500million the amount of repurchase obligations (such as those of Agilent Technologies World Trade,Inc., a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent ("World Trade") (see Note19, "Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents")), that we are permitted to incur.
18.SENIOR NOTES The following table summarizes the company's senior notes: Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 (in millions) 2017 Senior Notes $ 637 $ 611 2015 Senior Notes 500  2012 Senior Notes 251  Total $ 1,388 $ 611 2017 Senior Notes In October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.60% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on November1, 2017, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on May1 st and November1 st of each year and payments commenced on May1, 2008.
On November25, 2008, we terminated the two remaining interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400million. The asset value upon termination was approximately $43million. The proceeds were recorded as operating cash flows and the gain is being deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the senior notes.
2015 Senior Notes In September 2009, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.69% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September14, 2015, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March14 th and September14 th of each year, payments commencing on March14, 2010.
2012 Senior Notes In September 2009, the company also issued an aggregate principal amount of $250million in senior notes. The senior notes were issued at 99.91% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September14, 2012, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.45% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March14 th and September14 th of each year, payments commencing on March14, 2010.
114 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) All notes issued are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of Agilent's other senior unsecured indebtedness. The company incurred issuance costs of $5million in connection with the 2017 senior notes and a total of $5million in connection with the 2015 and 2012 senior notes. These costs were capitalized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and the costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes.
Upon the closing of the offering of the 2015 and 2012 senior notes, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $750million. Under the interest rate swaps, we will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 253 basis points and 257.6 basis points with respect to the 2015 and 2012 senior notes, respectively. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the senior notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate. In addition, as a result of the fair value hedge, the senior notes are presented on our balance sheet at fair value, reflecting the change in their value attributable to interest rate risk. The hedging relationship qualifies for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness, and consequently we do not expect any ineffectiveness during the life of the swap and any movement in the value of the swap would be reflected in the movement in fair value of the senior notes. At October31, 2009, the fair value of the swaps on 2015 and 2012 senior notes was an asset of $3million with a corresponding increase in carrying value of the senior notes.
19.OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT AND LONG-TERM RESTRICTED CASH& CASH EQUIVALENTS The following table summarizes the company's long-term debt: Years Ended October31, 2009 2008 (in millions) World Trade debt $ 1,500 $ 1,500 Other debt 16 14 Total long-term debt $ 1,516 $ 1,514 World Trade Debt In January 2006, World Trade entered into a five-year Master Repurchase Agreement with a counterparty in which World Trade sold 15,000 ClassA preferred shares of Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited ("Cayco") to the counterparty, having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5billion. World Trade owns all of the outstanding common shares of Cayco, a separate legal entity.
In September 2008, Agilent and World Trade entered into an agreement (the "Lloyds Related Agreement") with Lloyds TSB Bankplc ("Lloyds"). Under the Lloyds Related Agreement, on November17, 2008 (the "Effective Date"), Lloyds accepted the transfer by novation of all of the rights and obligations of the counterparty under a revised Master Repurchase Agreement. On the Effective Date, Lloyds paid $1.5billion to the prior counterparty in consideration of the novation and World Trade's repurchase obligation was extended to January27, 2011 (the "Extended Repurchase Date"). World Trade is obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to Lloyds at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, with reference to LIBOR plus 175 basis points beginning on the Effective Date.
115 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Lloyds can accelerate the Extended Repurchase Date or cause a redemption of the preferred Cayco shares only upon certain events of default, but neither World Trade nor Agilent has the right to accelerate the Extended Repurchase Date. The World Trade obligation of $1.5billion is recorded and classified as a long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet.
Other Debt On August11, 2008 a consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, borrowed Indian Rupees equivalent to $15million from Citibank N.A. at 12.75percent per annum interest rate for 5years, maturing on August9, 2013 to finance a capital project in India. The loan is recorded and classified as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet.
Long-Term Restricted Cash& Cash Equivalents As of October31, 2009 and October31, 2008, $1,566million and $1,582million were reported as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet, respectively. Of these amounts, $1,555million and $1,571million were held in commercial paper maintained in connection with our World Trade debt obligation as of October31, 2009 and October31, 2008, respectively.
20.STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM As of October31, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized stock repurchase programs of up to $8.466billion of our common stock. As of October31, 2009, we had repurchased a total of approximately 220million shares of our common stock for $7.624billion. In addition, $3million of service and legal fees were recorded in equity. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. The remaining amount that is authorized under the 2008 program is $843million. On March26, 2009, the company announced that it was suspending its stock repurchase program until the end of the 2009 fiscal year. On November15, 2009, the company's 2008 stock repurchase program expired upon the termination of its two-year term (see note22 "Subsequent Event").

We are a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Agilent has three businesses bio-analytical measurement, electronic 116 Table of Contents AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) measurement and semi-conductor and board test each of which comprises a reportable segment. In the beginning of the first fiscal quarter of 2009, we formed a new operating segment from our existing businesses: the semiconductor and board test segment. The new segment covers semiconductor equipment and services sold to semiconductor manufacturing and printer circuit board assembly customers. In addition, in the first quarter of 2009, we moved microscopy measurement from the bio-analytical measurement segment to the electronic measurement segment. All historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements. The segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Other factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels, were also considered in determining our reportable segments.
A description of our three reportable segments is as follows:  Bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our key product categories include: gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, microfluidics, electrophoresis, microarrays, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) instrumentation, laboratory automation and robotics, software and informatics, and related bioreagents, consumables and services.
Electronic measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems, monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications networks and services, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.
Semiconductor and board test business provides standard and customized measurement instruments and systems which enable customers to develop and test state of the art semiconductors, test and inspect printed circuit boards, perform functional testing, and measure position and distance information to the sub-nanometer level.
A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include costs of centralized research and development, legal, accounting, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments.
The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including adjusted income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, non-cash amortization and impairment of other intangibles and other items as noted in the reconciliation below.
