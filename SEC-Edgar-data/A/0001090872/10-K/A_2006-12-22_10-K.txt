Food safety industries apply the same general technologies for chemical analysis as the pharmaceutical and environmental markets, including gas and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. For example, our mass spectrometer portfolio, including recently introduced liquid chromatography mass spectrometers, are used to analyze residual pesticides in food. Additionally, bioagriculture industries seek to improve crops and foods by conducting research on these organisms, as well as testing for genetically modified content, using microarray and microfluidics solutions.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Products A key factor in all of our bio-analytical measurement target markets is the need for new products that increase customer productivity and provide high quality data that enable decision-making by our customers.
Microarray Products Since announcing the launch of our DNA microarray program for the life sciences in December1999, we have become a leading supplier of microarray solutions which we sell primarily to pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies in our for-profit markets, as well as academic and government funded organizations in our not-for-profit markets. Using our refined inkjet manufacturing process, we make highly sensitive 60-mer oligonucleotide, or oligo, microarrays. This unique inkjet process is highly flexible and accurate, enabling the faster manufacture of high quality custom microarrays. In 2006, we expanded our line of microarrays to offer a new line of high-density arrays providing enhanced genomics solutions for a variety of applications.
Microfluidics Products The Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer is the first commercial microfluidics product for the analysis of a wide range of biological molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins and cells. The bioanalyzer chips allow sample quality assessment to be done in a fraction of the usual time using fewer samples and reagents than traditional gel electrophoresis. We also provide related software, which enables the bioanalyzer to be used for the development and manufacture of protein-based therapeutics. The bioanalyzer is commonly used in genomics laboratories and has enabled the standardization of RNA quality measurement.
10 Gas Chromatography Products Agilent is the world's leading provider of gas chromatographs, both laboratory and portable models. A gas chromatograph ("GC") is used to separate any gas, liquid or solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. We continue to expand the application space for our GCs with the development of new separation columns and product enhancements. Over the last three years, Agilent has introduced updated and advanced models of all of its major gas chromatography platforms.
Liquid Chromatography Products A liquid chromatograph ("LC") or a high performance liquid chromatograph ("HPLC") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. Used when sample vaporization is not an option, LC also separates and detects compounds to determine molecular identity and quantity. Our LC instruments are modular in construction and can be configured to form instruments that perform specific analyses. Agilent's HPLC system, the Agilent 1100 Series, has sold over 60,000 systems since its introduction, and this year was replaced by its successor, the 1200 SeriesLC. The 1200 Series is an advanced version which enables true "fast chromatography" through both pressure and temperature control. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns and ongoing product enhancements. Our latest innovation, HPLC-Chip, is fully commercialized and creating demand for nano LC solutions across many markets.
Mass Spectrometry Products A mass spectrometer ("MS") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical's molecular mass and on characteristic patterns of fragment masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing proteins and other biological entities that undergo transformations because it enables the understanding and characterization of their many different states. MS systems are typically used in combination with gas or liquid chromatographs. In the past three years, Agilent significantly expanded its mass spectrometry portfolio with a focus on reliability, sensitivity and ease of use. This year, we introduced two new LC/MS platforms, the Agilent 6410 Triple Quadrapole MS and the 6510 Quadrapole-Time of Flight MS. These new platforms serve new and growing markets for Agilent.
Software and Informatics Products We provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software facilitates the regulatory-compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality control environments. In 2005, we completed the acquisitions of Scientific Software,Inc. and Silicon Genetics,Inc., expanding our portfolio of chromatography data systems and providing an entry into bioinformatics. The integration of these companies into Agilent has expanded our portfolio and market opportunities.
Consumables and Services We also offer a broad range of consumable products, which support our LC, GC and MS technology platforms. These consumable products include chemical standards, instrument replacement parts, brand-specific chromatography columns and consumable supplies to meet our customers' analysis needs.

We selectively use third parties to provide manufacturing capabilities outside our core competencies, such as the manufacture of printed circuit assemblies and the delivery of shipment logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California and Delaware in the U.S., China, Germany and Japan. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing and so typically do not maintain a high level of inventory.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Competition The markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition. Our principal competitors in the life sciences arena include: Affymetrix,Inc., Applied BiosystemsInc., GE Healthcare, Invitrogen Corp., Thermo Electron 12 Corp. and Waters Corp. Our principal competitors in the chemical analysis arena include: Applied BiosystemsInc., Perkin Elmer Corp., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Electron Corp. and Varian,Inc. Agilent competes on the basis of price, product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise and global channel coverage.
Bio-Analytical Measurement Government Regulation The analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis business are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. Therefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, the EPA can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or we could face fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. These organizations are generally headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October2006, our general infrastructure and shared services organizations employed approximately 2,750 people, which includes 200 Agilent Labs employees.
13 The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.
Research and Development Research and development ("R&D") expenditures were $655million in 2006, $650million in 2005 and $599million in 2004, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services.
Backlog At October31, 2006, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business amounted to approximately $700million, as compared to approximately $670million at October31, 2005. At October31, 2006, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately $260million, as compared to approximately $180million at October31, 2005. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to customers within nine months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property Our general policy has been to seek patent and other intellectual property protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or to give us a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and applications have value, in general no single patent or license is in itself material. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that our rights will provide significant competitive advantages.
Materials Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. Both our electronic and bio-analytical measurement businesses purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. No single supplier is material, although some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase of incremental inventory for supply buffer as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.
Environmental Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign 14 governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. These laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures.
Some of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by HP. As part of our spin-off from HP in 1999, HP has agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. Remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties.
In addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us with respect to that subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP's obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.
We are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are indemnifying HP for any liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.
We are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities being assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.
International Operations Our net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 66percent in fiscal 2006, 64percent in fiscal 2005 and 65percent in fiscal 2004, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Approximately 13percent of our annual revenues in each of the last three years was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.
Long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 55percent in fiscal year 2006, 50percent in fiscal year 2005 and 54percent in fiscal year 2004. Approximately 19, 17 and 16percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
15 Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.
Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment and finance receivable portfolios we hold. The U.S. and international community's response to recent terrorist activities could exacerbate these risks. For example, there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note23, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets On November28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. ("Lumileds") to Philips pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Share Purchase Agreement") dated as of August12, 2005 among Agilent, Agilent LED International, Philips Lumileds Holding B.V. and Philips. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, Agilent received $949million in cash proceeds, as well as approximately $51million in repayment of outstanding advances to Lumileds and interest due to Agilent.
In December2005, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of our semiconductor products business to Avago pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of August14, 2005 and amended November30, 2005 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Agilent received approximately $2.6billion in cash proceeds.
On October31, 2006, we distributed Agilent's equity interest in Verigy by means of a dividend to our stockholders. Prior to the distribution, on June1, 2006, Agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its semiconductor test solutions business to Verigy, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent. In June and July2006, Verigy sold approximately 8.7million of its ordinary shares, or approximately 15percent of its outstanding shares, in an initial public offering. On October31, 2006, the aggregate market value of the Verigy shares which were distributed was $840million.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors Risks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
Visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, if the Asia Pacific market does not grow as anticipated, our results could suffer. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such decline could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins.
We may not be successful in our efforts to maintain a reduced cost structure, and the actions that we take in order to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.
We have taken, and continue to take, various actions to transition our company to a reduced cost structure. For example, in fiscal year 2005, we announced the restructuring of our global infrastructure organization to reduce costs by $450million. This program has not yet been completed.
There are several risks inherent in our efforts to maintain a reduced cost structure. These include the risks that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and hold them at a level necessary to sustain or increase profitability and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges. For example, a reduced cost structure could lead to increases in demand for items like travel, training, consultants, manufacturing and operating supplies, as we experienced in parts of 2004. As we transform our infrastructure, we expect to face ongoing pressure to control expenses. If we are not able to hold down expenses we may have to further reduce our workforce. There is also the risk that cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products, to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete and to operate effectively. Each of the above measures could have long-term effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, making it more 18 difficult for us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our income to be lower than it otherwise might be, which would adversely affect our stock price.
If we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.
We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:  properly identify customer needs;  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;  differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;  price our products competitively;  anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and  control product quality in our manufacturing process.
Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsourced significant portions of our information technology ("IT") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
Failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
Our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are 19 subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.
Our income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match our demand.
Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.
Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;  changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  negative consequences from changes in tax laws;  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;  differing labor regulations;  differing protection of intellectual property;  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.
We centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables 20 functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.
Our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
Our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.
Our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
In the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in the fiscal year ended October31, 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of Verigy. During the same period, we completed 4 acquisitions of companies or businesses. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, or the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:  the retention of key employees;  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;  the retention of key customers;  the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities within those of the acquired company; and  the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company.
A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:  effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.
Future impairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. And, our inability to timely and effectively apply our systems of internal controls to an acquired business could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
21 In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.
Environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. In addition, HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations.
We have agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.
Our current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.
Our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
Our businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In 22 addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.
Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
Some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.
We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.
Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
While we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, products or services. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements, and we may not be able to obtain license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products.
We often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses. We cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our intellectual property portfolio, which we use in negotiating licenses and asserting counterclaims, has changed as a result of our divestitures and the Verigy spin-off. Portions of that portfolio relevant to the buyer of our semiconductor products business or to Verigy are no longer available for our use except for a very limited ability to sublicense the divested and spun off intellectual property. We expect the IP portfolio to continue to change as we review and adjust our IP holdings consistent with our business strategies. Accordingly, the amount of intellectual property that we may use in our defense or for negotiations has decreased and will continue to change. We may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable 23 as we may have been able to obtain if we could have included in our defense or negotiations the divested and spun off intellectual property.
Third parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury.
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results.
Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our intellectual property rights or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
We expect to receive a Revenue Agent's Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for 2000 through 2002 claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome of this examination or any future examinations involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the U.S. and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. These taxes are subject to review or audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state, local and foreign tax authorities. In connection with an IRS audit of our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002, in October2006, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) in which the IRS claims significant increases to our U.S. taxable income which could result in a commensurate increase in our U.S. income taxes payable. This claim relates to the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates. We expect to receive a Revenue Agent's Report with respect to this claim in due course in which we anticipate the IRS will assert a significant aggregate tax deficiency, plus interest and possible penalties. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws. Accordingly, we will oppose the claimed adjustments vigorously. However, there can be no assurance that we will prevail, and, if this matter is decided adversely to us and we are required to pay a significant amount of additional U.S. taxes (and applicable interest and possible penalties) for these years, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
If we suffer loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.
Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since 24 we have recently consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could harm our brands and operating results.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, Section404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we assess and our auditors attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement for each fiscal year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, an important part of our growth strategy has been, and will likely continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and our business grows. Likewise, the complexity of our systems and controls may become more difficult to manage as we transform our operating structure and continue to reduce infrastructure costs. To effectively manage these changes, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in light of likely future acquisitions of companies that are not in compliance with Section404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation, or difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause it to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.

Item 3.
Legal Proceedings In November2001, a securities class action, Kassin v. Agilent Technologies,Inc., et al., Civil Action No.01-CV-10639, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court") against certain investment bank underwriters for our initial public offering ("IPO"), Agilent and various of our officers and directors at the time of the IPO. In 2003, the Court granted Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims against Agilent based on Section10 of the Securities Exchange Act, but 26 denied Agilent's motion to dismiss the claims based on Section11 of the Securities Act. Agilent and more than 200 other issuer defendants have reached an agreement in principle for a settlement with plaintiffs. Under the settlement, plaintiffs' claims against Agilent and its directors and officers would be released, in exchange for a contingent payment (which, if made, would be paid by Agilent's insurer) and an assignment of certain potential claims. On June14, 2004, papers formalizing the settlement among the plaintiffs, issuer defendants and insurers were presented to the Court in New York. On February15, 2005, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement conditioned upon the parties' modification of a proposed bar order contained in the settlement. On August31, 2005, the Court confirmed its preliminary approval of the settlement. On April24, 2006, the Court held a fairness hearing in connection with the motion for final approval of the settlement. The Court did not issue a ruling on the motion for final approval at the fairness hearing. On December5, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Court's order certifying a class in several "test cases" that had been selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the coordinated proceeding in re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation. The settlement remains subject to a number of conditions, including final approval of the Court. Plaintiffs continue to prosecute their claims against the underwriter defendants, and discovery is now underway. Under our separation agreements with HP, HP agreed to indemnify us for a substantial portion of IPO-related liabilities. If the settlement does not occur, and the litigation against the company continues, Agilent believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the case vigorously. In light of the pending settlement, we do not expect this case to be material.
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Overview and Executive Summary Agilent, incorporated in Delaware in May1999, is the world's premier measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 16percent of our stock in November1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). HP distributed the remaining 84percent of our stock to its stockholders on June2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend.
Our fiscal year end is October31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
Agilent currently has two businesses focused on bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement. During the past year, we divested two of our historical businesses, the semiconductor products business and the semiconductor test solutions business. In December2005, we sold the semiconductor products business and recorded a gain of approximately $1.8billion. In October2006, we completed the distribution to our stockholders of our semiconductor test solutions business. We have reflected both the semiconductor products business and the semiconductor test solutions business as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
33 Agilent's net revenue from continuing operations in 2006 was $4,973million, an increase of 6percent in comparison to 2005. In our bio-analytical business, net revenue in 2006 increased 9percent in comparison to 2005. Demand increased across all markets in bio-analytical measurement with strongest growth occurring in biotechnology solutions. In our electronic measurement business, net revenue in 2006 increased 5percent in comparison to 2005. The electronic measurement business saw growth in our general purpose segments, led by aerospace /defense and semiconductor design and manufacturing. Agilent's total net revenue in 2005 increased 3percent in comparison to 2004.
Net income in 2006 was $3,307million, which included the income from and gain on sale of our semiconductor products business for $1,816million and the sale of our investment in Lumileds for a gain of $901million. Net income in 2005 was $327million, a decrease of 11percent in comparison to $369million in 2004. The decrease in total net income for 2005 was driven by a $174million decrease in net income associated with discontinued operations offset by a $132million increase in net income from continuing operations.
In 2006, we generated operating cash flows of $431million and had a cash and cash equivalent balance as of October31, 2006 of $2,262million. In 2005, we generated operating cash flows of $656million and had a cash and cash equivalent balance as of October31, 2005 of $2,226million.
The following significant events were accomplished in fiscal year 2006:  In November2005, we finalized the sale of our investment in Lumileds to Philips for $949million plus the repayment of $51million of the outstanding principal debt and interest due to us.
In December2005, we sold our semiconductor products business to Avago. We received approximately $2.6billion in cash proceeds.
In October2006, we completed the spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business. The aggregate market value of ordinary shares distributed to Agilent stockholders was approximately $840million.
In June2006, we completed a stock repurchase program of $4.466billion of our common stock and in September2006 we commenced another stock repurchase program for up to $2.0billion dollars, to be completed over the next 2years.
We completed the actions necessary to reduce our infrastructure costs by approximately $450million.
Having completed the disposal of two semiconductor-related businesses, Agilent is less exposed to the highly cyclical semiconductor market. Therefore, we expect that Agilent's current operating model will experience lower cyclicality in revenue and costs than we experienced in prior years. Looking forward, we are mindful of the economic uncertainties in the year ahead and Agilent's focus is to leverage, through higher sustainable growth, the more stable operating model we've built. Our goal is to grow our revenue at a faster rate than the electronic measurement and bio-analytical measurement markets, primarily through increasing market share and complementary acquisitions which will add to our top line growth.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although 34 these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, restructuring and asset impairment charges, inventory valuation, investment impairments, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue recognition.
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor-specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition. Most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome, requiring future adjustments to revenue.
Restructuring and asset impairment charges.
The three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions, the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. Plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. These estimates were derived using the guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No.144"), Staff Accounting Bulletin 100, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges" ("SAB 100"), Emerging Issues Task Force 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94-3") and lastly, SFAS No.146 "Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS No.146"). If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.
Inventory valuation.
We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory 35 charge. Our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
Investment impairments.
We recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our publicly traded equity securities and our cost-method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other-than-temporary. Significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including the severity and duration of the impairment, forecasted recovery, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Share-based compensation.
We account for share-based awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R), Shared-Based Payment ("SFAS No.123(R)") which was effective November1, 2005 for Agilent. Under the new standard, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which is generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight-line basis for awards granted after November1, 2005 over the vesting period of the award. For awards issued prior to November1, 2005, we recognize share-based compensation expense based on FASB Interpretation 28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans an interpretation of APB Opinions No.15 and 25", which provides for accelerated expensing. Our estimate of share-based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), future forfeitures and related tax effects. We consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe are representative of future behavior. We estimate the stock price volatility using the implied volatility of Agilent's publicly traded stock options. We have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.
Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
36 The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date October31 for U.S. plans and September30 for non-U.S plans. For U.S. plans, the discount rate was determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against the cash flows from a hypothetically constructed portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as a proxy for setting the discount rate. The discount rate increased slightly over the prior year to 6.0percent. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds. In recent years, decreasing interest rates, particularly outside the U.S., have increased our benefit obligations and our net plan costs. These increases have been in large part offset by a declining number of plan participants as a result of our various restructuring programs. The entire impact of declining discount rates is not recognized immediately under current accounting standards. As of October31, 2006, delayed recognition of the impact of declining discount rates was the primary factor in approximately $297million in unrecognized actuarial losses for non-U.S. plans. These losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants ranging from 12 to 18years depending on the plan.
The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns. As of October31, 2006, delayed recognition of better than expected investment performance was a significant factor in $63million of unrecognized actuarial gains for U.S. plans. These gains will be recognized over approximately 12years or the expected average future service life for U.S. plan participants. A one percent change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2006 would result in a $6million impact on U.S. pension expense and a $15million impact on non-U.S. pension expense.
The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations were $81million in 2006, $106million in 2005 and $122million in 2004. Due to final payouts from our Excess Plan in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2007, we expect a settlement under SFAS No.88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. We cannot currently estimate this impact.
Valuation of long-lived assets.
We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2006. Based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. We have also assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. Asset impairments primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell. During 2006, we incurred $42million of asset impairment charges, which includes approximately $3million recorded in discontinued operations. In addition, we recorded $1million of investment impairment charges during 2006.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. We estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses, which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions. We then determine the carrying value of these businesses. We exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses. We then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows. If the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to 37 these assessments. Changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets such as our property, plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.
Accounting for income taxes.
Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. Realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.109 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence, which made it difficult for positive evidence to overcome. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was recorded in all instances. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. Profits or losses incurred in the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance. We expect that the effective tax rate applied to our pre-tax income in fiscal 2007 will be lower than it otherwise would be because future income taxes in the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions will be offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance to effectively eliminate any tax expense or benefit in those jurisdictions. Income taxes will continue to be recorded for various jurisdictions subject to the need for valuation allowances in those jurisdictions.
We have not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
38 Restructuring and Asset Impairment We initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods: the 2001 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan ("Prior Plans"). The workforce reduction portion of the Prior Plans was completed during fiscal year 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, due to the then pending divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses, we launched a new restructuring plan ("2005 Plan") to reduce our workforce and facility footprint to match a smaller organizational size.
In 2006 we continued execution of the 2005 plan and recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $186million, of which $111million was for workforce reduction expenses and the remainder for facility impairment and lease termination expenses. As of October31, 2006, our accrual for pending workforce reduction costs was $13million, which is down from the $44million balance from the prior year as the workforce reduction program winds down. Our accrual for the consolidation of excess facilities, however, increased $9million from the prior year due to significant facility consolidation efforts that were initiated during the past year. The workforce reduction portion of the 2005 plan is expected to be substantially completed in fiscal year 2007, but we will continue to make lease payments on some of our excess facility space for approximately the next five years.
The restructuring accrual is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. For further details on our restructuring plans, see Note19, "Restructuring and Asset Impairment", to our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (rolling twelve month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. For example, over the last three years the U.S dollar has weakened against the Euro and the British pound and although we successfully hedged currency movements in those currencies each year, we have experienced a net increase in reported expenses in Europe as a result of currency fluctuations over this time period.
Results from Continuing Operations The following discussion excludes our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business as their results are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Income from continuing operations in 2006 was $1,437million, which included the gain on sale of our Lumileds investment of $901million. In 2005, we recorded $191million in income from continuing operations compared to $59million recorded in 2004.

Bio-analytical measurement results were consistent with our normal seasonal pattern and reflected increased demand across virtually all of our markets. Our bio-analytical business is comprised of two areas, life science and chemical analysis. In life science, growth was due to demand from biotechnology customers and the impact of new product introduction in LC, LCMS and microarrays. In chemical analysis growth was driven by demand for environmental and food testing solutions.. Our electronic measurement business saw a 5percent revenue growth, solid profitability, and good return on invested capital. Growth was driven by underlying customer demand in several key markets, including semiconductor design and verification, and consumer electronics design and manufacturing. However, growth was negatively impacted because of two factors: First, capital spending in the wireline segment was constrained by mergers in the customer base (both NEMsand communication service providers) as well as uncertainty in service providers' investments as they transition from fixed-line to IP-based networks and services. Second, we had a slowdown in our wireless monitoring business, as the industry transitions from 2G to 3G networks amid stronger competition.
Services and other revenue includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products, warranty extensions and consulting. In 2006 and 2005, services and other revenue increased over the prior years as our installed base of products increased and a change in standard warranty from three years to one year drove a higher volume of extended warranty business.

In 2006, total gross margin increased 3percentage points in comparison to 2005. This improvement was the result of volume increases and cost efficiencies, in particular, restructuring activities, material cost reductions and overall operational improvements. In addition, we benefited from the refunctionalization of some general corporate expenses out of costs of products and services and into operating expense, which is consistent with our current less manufacturing-intensive operations following the disposal of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test solutions businesses. In 2005, total gross margin increased 3percentage points in comparison to 2004. The increase was attributable to our efforts to lower our cost structure and refine our operating model. In 2005, we benefited from a more variable cost structure through use of contract manufacturers and we reduced manufacturing costs by shifting production to lower-cost regions. These benefits continued through 2006.
41 Operating margins in 2006 increased 4percentage points as compared to 2005 due to continued restructuring activities and tighter controls on spending. In 2005 operating margin increased 4percentage points compared to 2004. This was primarily due to savings from our restructuring efforts and a decrease in restructuring costs for research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 compared to 2004.
Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. We conduct five types of research and development: basic research, which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future; foundation technologies, which enables fundamental advances across all businesses; communications, which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information; life sciences, which enables next-generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes; and measurement, which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices, digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies; software, systems and solutions such as applied mathematics, knowledge management and measurement science; life sciences such as computational biology, molecular diagnostics and high-throughput measurements; and photonics, such as precision automation technology, optical switching and high-speed optical links. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than 20,000 products already in production, other research is on major new product releases, and yet other focused on developing new product segments for the future. Because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses, it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects either in the periods presented or on a forward looking basis.
Income from continuing operations in 2006 was $1,437million, which includes a gain of $901million for the sale of our investment in Lumileds, an equity investment. The remaining increase in income from continuing operations, in comparison to the prior year, is attributable to an increase in revenue of $288million, an increase in net interest income of $64million and also attributable to the gain recorded in connection with the sale of two properties located in California for a net gain of approximately $121million. Income from continuing operations in 2005 was $191million, an increase of approximately $132million in comparison to 2004. The increase was primarily driven by reduction in costs and expenses due to the incremental benefits of our restructuring programs and discretionary spending controls.
At October31, 2006, our headcount, on a continuing operations basis, was approximately 18,700 compared to 19,400 in 2005 and 19,800 in 2004. The decrease in workforce is predominantly due to infrastructure reduction in light of the recent business divestitures.
Provision for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations Years Ended October31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 91 $ 142 $ 57 For the year ended October31, 2006, we recorded an income tax provision of $91million on continuing operations as compared with an income tax provision of $142million and $57million on 42 continuing operations for the years ended October31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in jurisdictions other than the U.S. Income generated in the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions were offset by adjustments to their respective valuation allowances. The income tax provision also includes a benefit of $29million related to the resolution of domestic tax-related issues for years covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The Tax Sharing Agreement is related to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard.
For 2006, the annual effective tax rate was 6.0percent on continuing operations. The 6.0percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes on the sale of our Lumileds joint venture at an effective tax rate of zero in the U.S. (due to the operation of the valuation allowance) and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions. In addition, the low continuing operations tax rate is a result of the $29million benefit related to the resolution of issues covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations.
For 2005, the annual effective tax rate was 42.6percent on continuing operations. This tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations. Additionally, the repatriation tax of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") caused a 7.2percent increase in the 2005 effective tax rate as during 2005 we decided to repatriate earnings on which we had not previously provided U.S. taxes.
For 2004, the annual effective tax rate was 49.1percent on continuing operations. This tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low-tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business and our semiconductor test solutions business which are now reported as discontinued operations. In addition, non-deductible goodwill increased the rate by 5.6percent.
On October22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and reported an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970million and a related tax liability of approximately $48million in our fiscal 2005 federal income tax return. For 2005, $23million of the $48million is provided for in the discontinued operations' provision for income taxes, while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations' provision for income taxes.
Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $76million, $54million and $96 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. It is anticipated that these tax holidays will benefit Agilent in a similar way in 2007.
During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.109 which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the 43 U.S and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under SFAS No.109 to require full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal.
In connection with an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit of our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) in October2006 in which the IRS claims significant increases to our U.S. taxable income which could result in a commensurate increase in our U.S. income taxes payable. This claim relates to the use of Agilent's brand name by our foreign affiliates. We expect to receive a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) with respect to this claim in due course in which we anticipate the IRS will assert a significant aggregate tax deficiency, plus interest and possible penalties. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that the chances of the IRS prevailing on the claim are remote. Accordingly, we will oppose the claimed adjustments vigorously. In accordance with SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies", we have not accrued an income tax liability in our October31, 2006 financial statements as we believe the possibility that the IRS will be successful in its claim for the adjustment is remote.
For all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds Lumileds was a global joint venture between Agilent and KoninklijkePhilips Electronics N.V.("Philips"). Lumileds manufactures high-power light emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Agilent sold its interest in Lumileds on November28, 2005. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, upon closure of the sale transaction, the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated. The purchase price paid by Philips under the Share Purchase Agreement was $949million. In addition, Lumileds repaid the $51million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November30, 2001.
Our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in Lumileds was $901million in 2006, $42million in 2005 and $29million in 2004.
General Infrastructure and Shared Services For Agilent overall, in response to the divestiture and spin-off of our semiconductor businesses, we have decreased our infrastructure costs primarily through restructuring programs and streamlining our operations. We have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance, IT and workplace services and moved many of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions. In 2006, savings for infrastructure costs associated with restructuring plans, IT data center and networking costs, IT project investments and cost controls were approximately $280million compared with 2005. We passed these savings on to all our businesses according to usage of related services. The general infrastructure and shared services functions ended 2006 with approximately 2,750 employees, a decrease of approximately 1,160 employees from one year ago and a decrease of approximately 1,300 employees from two years ago. Over the past two years, general infrastructure and shared services headcount has dropped by approximately 1,190 people in the U.S. and Europe and has also dropped by approximately 110 people in Asia. Although reductions in infrastructure costs are largely complete as we have divested our 44 semiconductor products business and spun-off our semiconductor test solutions business, we expect that a few key infrastructure areas such as IT and workplace services will continue to see savings in the next fiscal year.
Segment Overview During 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business" and Note 4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business" to our consolidated financial statements for further information. With this reorganization, Agilent has two businesses bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement. In addition to the discussion below, also see Note23, "Segment Information", to our consolidated financial statements.
Electronic Measurement Our electronic measurement business provides standard and customized solutions that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronic equipment and systems and communications networks and services.
Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October31, 2006 over 2005 Change 2005 over 2004 Change 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Orders $ 3,447 $ 3,282 $ 3,180 5 % 3 % Net revenue from products $ 2,914 $ 2,758 $ 2,752 6 %  Net revenue from services and other 505 507 473  7 % Total net revenue $ 3,419 $ 3,265 $ 3,225 5 % 1 % The order and revenue information below reflects a characterization using a new methodology for defining "communications test" and "general purpose test" as the markets into which our products are sold. This is a change from our previous classification method which relied on product type as the primary classification mechanism.
Compared to 2005, electronic measurement experienced a 5percent increase in orders. Order growth was driven by strength in electronic manufacturing test, wireless component test, and signal sources for both aerospace/defense and wireless communication applications. The 3percent increase in orders in 2005 compared to 2004 was related to significant growth in our wireline communications test businesses while wireless communications test orders grew only slightly in that period.
Electronic measurement revenues were up 5percent year-over-year in 2006 mainly attributable to increased volumes. Communications test made up approximately 43percent of the electronic measurement revenues for the year, and wireless test made up approximately 82percent of communications test. Communication test revenues were down 3percent year-over-year, with a 14percent year-over-year decline in wireline test and wireless test flat to last year. The decline in wireline test was driven by weakness in the router test and network monitoring businesses, while growth in wireless design software and wireless R&D were offset by weakness in the wireless network monitoring market. General purpose test revenues grew 11percent over 2005, with strength in semiconductor design and verification, aerospace/defense and consumer electronic manufacturing 45 applications. In 2005 segment revenues increased 1percent compared to 2004 due to the strength of our signal analyzers and signal generator-related products, telecom service provider network integration and next-generation IP services.
Looking forward to 2007, we anticipate revenue growth to be driven by opportunities tied to the continued development and deployment of multi-media (voice, data, audio, video) wireless services, proliferation of broadband and triple-play wireline offerings, expansion of the breadth of our product offerings, and growth in nanotechnology applications.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the electronic measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2006 versus 2005 and 2005 versus 2004.
Years Ended October31, 2006 over 2005 Change 2005 over 2004 Change 2006 2005 2004 Total gross margin 56 % 53 % 51 % 3 ppts 2 ppts Operating margin 14 % 11 % 9 % 3 ppts 2 ppts Research and development $ 463 $ 450 $ 426 3% 6% Selling, general and administrative $ 981 $ 926 $ 940 6% (1)% Income from operations $ 479 $ 360 $ 279 33% 29% Over the past three years, we have implemented cost reduction and restructuring plans to help lower our cost structure. Our electronic measurement business ended 2006 with approximately 11,850 employees, an increase of approximately 400 employees from one year ago. The increase in workforce has occurred primarily in lower cost geographies.
Gross margin for products and services increased 3percentage points year-over-year in 2006. Gross margin for products and services increased 2percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004. The improvement for all periods were driven by some volume increases and also by restructuring activities, material cost reductions, lower inventory charges and overall operational improvements.
Operating margin increased 3percentage points in 2006 compared to 2005, with improved gross margins driving almost all of the change. Operating margin increased 2percentage points in 2005 compared to 2004, and was driven by savings in selling, general and administrative expenses offset by increases in research and development expenditure.
Income from Operations Income from operations increased in 2006 by $119million compared to 2005 on a revenue increase of $154million. Restructuring through selective workforce reductions, reductions in our cost structure, improved material costs, lower inventory charges and overall operational improvements helped comparative operating results, with most of the improvement coming from better gross margins. In absolute dollars cost of sales was down 2percent from 2005 while revenue increased by 5percent over the same period.
Income from operations increased in 2005 by $81million compared to 2004 on a revenue increase of $40million. Restructuring through workforce reductions, reduction in our cost structure and discretionary spending controls helped comparative operating results.
46 Bio-analytical Measurement Our bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our seven key product categories include: microarrays, microfluidics, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, and related consumables, reagents and services. The business continued to achieve solid growth in 2006, with both orders and revenue growing by 9percent, compared to 2005, and operating income up 22percent. All seven key product categories contributed to the overall growth of the bio-analytical measurement segment. In 2005 sustained growth was recorded compared to 2004 with orders and net revenue increasing by 12percent and 7percent respectively and operating income up 6percent.
Orders and Net Revenue Years Ended October31, 2006 over 2005 Change 2005 over 2004 Change 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Orders $ 1,628 $ 1,491 $ 1,332 9 % 12 % Net revenue from products $ 1,211 $ 1,096 $ 1,034 10 % 6 % Net revenue from services and other $ 343 325 299 6 % 9 % Total net revenue $ 1,554 $ 1,421 $ 1,333 9 % 7 % Bio-analytical measurement business orders continued to grow, achieving record levels in 2006. In both 2005 and 2006, growth was achieved in all geographies, with the highest rates achieved in Asia and Europe. Results were consistent with our normal seasonal pattern and reflected strong demand across virtually all of our markets.
Chemical analysis orders, representing approximately 57percent of bio- analytical measurement, grew 8percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During the year, we continued to see strength from the food and environmental segments due to increased testing demands from new regulations enacted in Europe and Asia, particularly China and India. These regulatory changes led to strong demand for our gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry solutions that are used for food and environmental testing. Also new products such as the triple quadrupole ("QQQ") mass spectrometer which sell into these segments were well received. In addition, higher average oil prices for the year continue to drive demand for our instrumentation in the hydrocarbon processing and petrochemical industries. Chemical analysis orders grew 11percent in 2005 compared to 2004 driven by demand for environmental testing solutions in Asia and strength in US Government spending relating to homeland security.
Life science orders, representing approximately 43percent of bio- analytical measurement, grew 11percent for the 2006year compared to 2005. This double digit growth was aided by the broad and rapid acceptance of recently introduced products such as the 1200 rapid resolution liquid chromatograph, QQQ mass spectrometer, new liquid chromatography columns, and new microarrays. During the year, we saw strong demand from contract research organizations and generic drug manufacturers in Europe and Asia, which helped offset a mostly soft spending year for large pharmaceuticals in the Americas region. Life science orders grew 14percent in 2005 compared to 2004 driven primarily by biotechnology and increased demand from generic drug manufacture.
47 Revenues for the year grew 9percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Both chemical analysis and life sciences had solid annual growth finishing the year at 9percent and 10percent respectively. Chemical analysis continues to see strong demand for our food and environmental testing solutions, which use instruments in the areas of liquid and gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. In life sciences, demand from contract research organizations and generic drug manufacturers for product such as microarrays, liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry products contributed to this segment's growth. In 2005, chemical analysis grew 5percent compared to 2004, with most of this growth driven by increasing environmental testing in Asia, while in life science; this segment grew 9percent, as growth in this segment was driven by increased demand from generic drug manufacturers.
Looking forward to 2007, we anticipate order and revenue to grow from 2006 levels, with strength across both our chemical analysis and life science businesses. We anticipate growth to be driven by recently released products such as rapid resolution liquid chromatography, enhanced single quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, QQQ, mass spectrometer, and quadrupole time-of-flight ("QTOF") mass spectrometry systems.
Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the bio-analytical measurement business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2006 versus 2005, and 2005 versus 2004.
Years Ended October31, 2006 over 2005 Change 2005 over 2004 Change 2006 2005 2004 Total gross margin 52 % 50 % 48 % 2 ppts 2 ppts Operating margin 15 % 14 % 14 % 1 ppt  Research and development $ 143 $ 136 $ 117 5% 16% Selling, general and administrative $ 430 $ 377 $ 342 14% 10% Income from operations $ 240 $ 197 $ 186 22% 6% Gross margin in 2006 from products and services increased 2percentage points compared to the same period last year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased revenue, manufacturing overhead efficiencies, and a decrease in general infrastructure costs. Gross margins increased by 2percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 due to revenue growth, improved microarray production processes, and increased efficiencies in support delivery.
Research and development expenses in 2006 increased by 5percent compared to the same period last year. This increase is due to continued investment in life sciences, increase in headcount from acquisitions, program spending to support our new product releases for this year, and higher general infrastructure costs. Research and development costs increased by 16percent in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to investment to support new product introductions, acquisition activity and Life Science businesses.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2006 increased 14percent compared to the same period last year. This is due to higher employee-related costs, incremental headcount from acquisitions, product launch expense to support new product releases, and higher general infrastructure costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 10percent in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased infrastructure costs and integration expenses to support acquisitions.
48 Operating margins increased by 1percentage point in 2006 compared to 2005. This is due to higher revenues and operational efficiencies offsetting the higher investments we made in research and development and selling, general, and administrative to accommodate growth. In 2005, operating margins were flat compared to 2004, as we heavily invested in research and development and small headcount increases in selling, general, and administrative to support growth.
Income from Operations Income from operations increased 22percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to increased revenue and operational efficiencies that offset higher investments and higher general infrastructure costs that were made in research and development and selling, general, and administrative to support our growth. Operating income increased 6percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due to increased revenue.
Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business On December1, 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago TechnologiesLtd. ("Avago"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA"), Agilent received approximately $2.6billion in cash proceeds. For further information, see Note3, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor Products Business", to our consolidated financial statements.
Discontinued operations results for our semiconductor products business for the past three years, including the gain from sale in the year ended October31, 2006, are summarized in the table below. In the year ended October31, 2005, the results include the camera module business, which was sold in February2005.
Years Ended October31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net revenue $ 141 $ 1,796 $ 2,021 Costs, expenses and other income (expense), net 133 1,564 1,779 Income from discontinued operations 8 232 242 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,816   Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations before taxes 1,824 232 242 Provision for taxes 8 46  Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations, net $ 1,816 $ 186 $ 242 Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business On August15, 2005, Agilent announced its intention to separate its semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy, into a stand-alone publicly traded company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds of $121million. As part of the offering, Agilent made a payment to Verigy of $19million, the amount by which the net IPO proceeds were insufficient to complete the agreed-upon Verigy initial capitalization of $140million. As a result of the IPO, Agilent recorded additional paid-in capital of $74million related to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares sold. Following the offering, Agilent owned 50million shares or approximately 85percent of Verigy's ordinary shares.
49 On October31, 2006, Agilent completed the spin-off of Verigy by distributing its remaining 85percent equity interest in Verigy to Agilent stockholders. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend to Agilent stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by $310million. In the distribution, Agilent distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of close of market on October16, 2006. In the aggregate, Agilent distributed 50million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent stockholders. Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October31, 2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value of the shares distributed in the distribution was $840million. The historical results of Verigy have been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. For further information, see Note4, "Discontinued Operations of our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business", to our consolidated financial statements.
The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations for the presented periods ended October31 included in the consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended October31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net revenue $ 777 $ 454 $ 604 Costs and expenses 703 489 522 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 74 (35 ) 82 Other income (expense), net  (2 )  Income (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes 74 (37 ) 82 Provision for taxes 20 13 14 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 54 $ (50 ) $ 68 Indemnifications In connection with the divestitures of our semiconductor products and semiconductor test businesses in 2006, we have provided indemnities to Verigy and Avago against certain damages which they might incur related to the businesses of Agilent not transferred to them and other defined categories of liability. These new indemnity obligations are in addition to preexisting indemnities to Hewlett Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP; indemnities to our officers and directors for certain liabilities which they might incur as a result of their service to Agilent; and other indemnifications which are customary in our industry or provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in connection with our commercial operations. These indemnities are described in greater detail in Note17, "Guarantees", to our consolidated financial statements.
Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position remained strong at October31, 2006, with cash and cash equivalents of $2,262million as compared to $2,226million at October31, 2005.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities We generated cash from continuing operations of $431million in 2006 compared to $656million in 2005.
50 We paid approximately $156million in taxes during 2006 as compared to $75million in 2005. The higher tax payments in 2006 were mostly associated with the U.S. tax liability created in 2005 for repatriation of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries of $970million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and with the 2005 federal alternate minimum tax.
We also made higher disbursements for restructuring activities of $166million during 2006, primarily in the form of severance payments, compared to $110million during 2005. The restructuring payments were more than offset by proceeds from the real estate sales related to the consolidation of excess facilities as reported in the investing section below. We have also paid approximately $155million during 2006 under our variable pay programs, as compared to approximately $83million paid out during 2005.
In 2006, accounts receivable generated cash of $8million versus cash generated of $47million in 2005. Days sales outstanding was reduced to 47days in 2006 as compared to 49days in 2005. Though revenue increased by 6percent year-over-year, decline in day's sales outstanding reflects continuing improvement in receivables management. In 2006, accounts payable generated cash of $56million versus cash generated of $19million in 2005. Inventory used cash of $55million in 2006 compared to $12million generated in 2005. Inventory days on hand were 95days in 2006 compared to 90days in 2005.
We contributed $41million to fund our U.S. defined benefit plan in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, we contributed $76million to fund our international defined benefits plans, compared to $34million in 2005. In 2006, total pension plan contributions were $117million, or 56percent more than in 2005. In 2007, we expect funding requirements for our various benefit plans to decrease to a total of approximately $39million. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. As the value of our assets increases relative to our future projected obligations we will make smaller contributions to maintain our funded status. In 2006, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability for $112million as several of our non-U.S. defined benefit retirement plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets. The establishment of the additional minimum liability also resulted in a net long term deferred tax asset for $34million.
Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations related to semiconductor products business was $7million during 2006 as compared to $256million in 2005. We completed the sale of our semiconductor products business in December2005.
Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations related to semiconductor test solutions business was $196million during 2006 as compared to $13million used in 2005. We completed the spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business in October2006.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations 2006 was $1,838million compared to $159million used in the same period in 2005.
In December2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products division for $2.5billion net of transaction costs and taxes. In November2005, we also completed the sale of our ownership in Lumileds to Philips for approximately $949million, plus repayment of approximately $51million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest from Lumileds. Sale of ownership in Lumileds resulted in a gain of approximately $901million.
51 Restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments, net, increased by $1,584million in 2006 as compared to a $22million increase in 2005. In connection with the financing described under "Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities" below, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies World Trade,Inc. ("World Trade"), which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent, is required to hold short-term investments. These short-term investments have been disclosed as restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet.
Investments in property, plant and equipment were $185million, an increase of $57million from 2005. The increase in the capital expenditure was due to our site restructuring following the semiconductor products division divestiture and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were $207million in 2006 as compared to $54million in 2005. During 2006, we sold our Palo Alto site and San Jose site for a total consideration of approximately $186.5million. We also purchased minority interests in consolidated joint ventures for $104million during 2006 which included primarily the remaining minority interest of 49percent in Yokogawa Analytical Systems for $98million. In addition, we invested $50million in the acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash in 2006 compared to $64million in 2005. Proceeds from the sale of short-term investments were $25million in 2006.
Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations related to our semiconductor products business was $6million in 2006 as compared to cash used of $27million during 2005. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations related to our semiconductor test solutions business was $36million in 2006 as compared to cash used of $14million during 2005.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2006 was $2,548million compared to $780million used in 2005.
Our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $4.466billion in 2005 and up to an additional $2billion by the end of fiscal 2008. We completed $4.466billion stock repurchase program in 2006. In addition we also repurchased our common stock for $56million under the 2006 program. As of October31, 2006, we have acquired approximately 127million shares of our common stock under both programs. Proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans were $547million and $198million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the proceeds was primarily due to the higher exercise rate of options as a result of a higher Agilent stock price and modifications to the terms of the options held by employees of our semiconductor products business. The modification effected the acceleration of vesting for all unvested options as part of the divestiture of the semiconductor products business.
We distributed $300million upon separation of our semiconductor test solutions business ("Verigy") on October31, 2006. This amount was held by Verigy as of October31, 2006. Agilent also made a payment of $19million pursuant to master separation agreement, the amount by which the aggregate net proceeds from Verigy IPO were less than $140million. For further details, see Note4, "Discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business", to our consolidated financial statements.
In January2006, World Trade entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with a counterparty pursuant to which World Trade sold to the counterparty 15,000 ClassA preferred shares having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5billion of its wholly owned subsidiary, which has its own assets and liabilities, and 52 received $1.5billion in cash. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the counterparty the preferred shares for 100percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January2011. The $1.5billion obligation of World Trade to repurchase the preferred shares has been treated as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet.
In December2005, we drew down $700million on a $1billion senior secured term borrowing facility to help finance our share repurchase program. In January2006, we applied $700million of the proceeds from the Repurchase Agreement to repay the full amount borrowed under the Credit Agreement. The senior secured term borrowing facility expired in the first quarter of 2006.
Net cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations related to our semiconductor test solutions business was $140million in 2006. During the third quarter of 2006, Verigy completed their initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7million shares. In addition, the underwriters of the IPO exercised a portion of their over-allotment options. Total proceeds from IPO and exercise of over-allotment options by underwriters were $121million, net. Agilent made a payment of an additional $19million pursuant to master separation agreement, the amount by which the aggregate net proceeds from Verigy IPO were less than $140million.
Other We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note18, "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases.
Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
On April13, 2005, Standard& Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings of Agilent to "BB+" from "BB", revising their rating outlook to "stable" from "positive". On August15, 2005, S&P raised its rating outlook on Agilent to "positive", but left the company's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings unchanged. On December11, 2006, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") upgraded their corporate family rating and probability of default rating of Agilent from "Ba2" to "Ba1" and revised their rating outlook to positive, leaving unchanged the speculative grade liquidity rating of "SGL-1".
Contractual Commitments Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
53 The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October31, 2006 for continuing operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Operating leases $ 79 $ 106 $ 41 $ 37 Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 426    Other purchase commitments 7 6 3 1 Retirement plans 39    Total $ 551 $ 112 $ 44 $ 38 Operating leases.
Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property.
Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 36percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
In addition to the above, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October31, 2006, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments was $9million, compared with $11million as of October31, 2005. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
Other purchase commitments.
These relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers. Purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a 90-day period without significant penalties.
Retirement plans.
Retirement plan funding includes the expected tax-deductible contribution planned for 2007. Funding projections beyond the current year are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions and the impact from asset performance and interest rates.
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October31, 2006 or October31, 2005.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and 54 losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Our operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 63percent of our revenues in 2006, 64percent of our revenues in 2005 and 65percent of our revenues in 2004 were generated in U.S. dollars.
We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October31, 2006 and October31, 2005, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Page Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements: Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 57 Consolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2006 59 Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2006 and 2005 60 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2006 61 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2006 62 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 63 Quarterly Summary (unaudited) 111 56 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Agilent Technologies,Inc.: We have completed integrated audits of Agilent Technologies,Inc.'s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2006, and an audit of its 2004 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Agilent Technologies,Inc. and its subsidiaries at October31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R), "Share-Based Payment" as of November1, 2005 and changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in fiscal 2006.
Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the 57 design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Agilent Technologies,Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May1999, is a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. Prior to our initial public offering of 16percent of our stock in November1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"). HP distributed the remaining 84percent of our stock to its stockholders on June2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend.
In the first quarter of 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business. The results of our semiconductor products business are presented as a discontinued operation for all periods in the consolidated financial statements included herein. See Note3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business." In the third quarter of 2006, we completed the initial public offering of our semiconductor test solutions business, VerigyLtd., ("Verigy"). Verigy was a majority-owned subsidiary of Agilent until the distribution of our remaining Verigy shares to Agilent stockholders on October31, 2006. The results of operations and financial position of Verigy are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent and reported as discontinued operations. See Note4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business." Basis of presentation.
The accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our fiscal year end is October31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and has full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations and cash flows for all periods presented.
Reclassifications.
Amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended October31, 2005 and October31, 2004 were reclassified to conform to the presentation used in 2006. See Note3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business," Note4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business" and Note7, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds" for a discussion relating to these reclassifications.
Principles of consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Partially owned, non-controlled equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method.
Use of estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events 63 and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, restructuring and asset impairment charges, share-based compensation, inventory valuation, investment impairments, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of long-lived assets and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue recognition.
We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services.
We recognize revenue, net of trade discounts and allowances, provided that (1)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2)delivery has occurred, (3)the price is fixed or determinable and (4)collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. We consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments. We consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable, and accordingly we defer revenue until amounts become due. At the time of the transaction, we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition.
Product revenue.
Our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment. Software is embedded in many of our test equipment products, but the software component is generally considered to be incidental. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns, when appropriate. For sales or arrangements that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete.
Where software is licensed separately, revenue is recognized when the software is delivered and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer or, in the case of electronic delivery of software, when the customer is given access to the licensed software programs. We also evaluate whether collection of the receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable and whether any other undelivered elements of the arrangement exist on which a portion of the total fee would be allocated based on vendor-specific objective evidence.
Service revenue.
Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer support, consulting, training and education. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. For example, customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period, while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer. In addition the four revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized.
Multiple element arrangements.
We use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If the criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until 64 such criteria are met or until the period(s) over which the last undelivered element is delivered. In the absence of objective evidence of fair value of a delivered element, we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. The price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value.
Deferred revenue.
Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of advanced billing and customer deposits for service, support and maintenance agreements.
Accounts receivable, net.
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of product returns.
Share-based compensation.
For the year ended 2006, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies,Inc. Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting in accordance with SFAS, No.123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No.123 (R)"), which was effective November1, 2005 for Agilent. Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations for share-based awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for proforma disclosure under SFAS No.123 were in effect for expense recognition purposes. Additionally, we recorded compensation expense using the fair value method for all share-based awards granted after November1, 2005. We recorded SFAS No.123 (R)compensation expense in continuing operations of $94million in 2006. See Note2, "New Accounting Pronouncements", for new accounting pronouncements affecting share-based awards beginning November1, 2005.
Through year end 2005, we accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No.25"). Under the intrinsic value method, we recorded compensation expense related to stock options in our consolidated statement of operations when the exercise price of our employee share-based award was less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. Compensation expense was also recorded for the LTPP using the variable accounting method. We recorded APB No.25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8million in 2005 and $7million in 2004. The APB No.25 compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 primarily related to our LTPP. We issue new shares for award exercises.
Inventory.
Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.
65 Taxes on income.
Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.
Warranty.
Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery, but our current reserve balance includes three year agreements from prior periods. We accrue for standard warranty costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies" ("SFAS No.5"), based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of gross product shipments. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note17, "Guarantees".
Shipping and handling costs.
Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
Our accounting complies with SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No.142"). Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years.
Advertising.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $44million in 2006, $33million in 2005 and $46million in 2004 for Agilent continuing operations.
Research and development.
Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.
Sales Taxes.
Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue.
Net income (loss) per share.
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. In computing diluted net income (loss) per share under the treasury stock method, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds of stock option exercises. For fiscal year 2006 the number of shares assumed to be purchased also considered the amount of unrecognized compensation cost for future service as required under SFAS No.123(R). Diluted net income per share for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 excluded the potentially dilutive effect of 8million, 49million and 41million options to purchase common stock, respectively, as their effect was antidilutive. Fiscal year 2004 also excluded shares issuable upon conversion of our then outstanding $1.15billion senior convertible debenture as the effect was not dilutive for this period, using the if-converted method pursuant to SFAS No.128, "Earnings per Share". Our convertible debt was redeemed as of September9, 2005 and therefore no longer outstanding nor part of the computation in 2006.
66 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Approximately 20percent of our cash and cash equivalents is held in the U.S., and 60percent is held in a centrally managed global cash pool outside the U.S. The remainder is held by other Agilent entities throughout the world. Approximately 8percent of our overall cash and cash equivalents is maintained in demand deposit accounts with global financial institutions of high credit quality and is available to be used in paying and receiving activities. The remainder is invested in institutional money market funds, short-term bank time deposits and similar short duration instruments with fixed maturities from overnight to three months. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our surplus funds. We have not experienced any credit losses from cash investments.
We classify investments as short-term investments if their original or remaining maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less. Our short-term investments consist of bank time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to maturity, and are classified as such because we have the intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost.
Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $1.6billion in 2006, $22million in 2005 and zero in 2004.
Fair value of financial instruments.
The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities where available.
Concentration of credit risk.
We sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. No single customer accounted for 10percent or more of the combined accounts receivable balance at October31, 2006 or 2005. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.
Derivative instruments.
Agilent is exposed to global market exchange rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts and purchased options, to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures, which include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, which has the exposure. For option contracts, we exclude time value from the measurement of effectiveness. To achieve hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies; hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
67 The derivatives entered into by Agilent are designated either as cash flow or fair value hedges. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, changes in value of the derivative are recognized in income in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. These amounts are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Fair value hedges are recorded in net income and are offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. Ineffectiveness in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was not significant.
We may also, from time to time, acquire warrants or other equity types of securities to purchase securities of other companies as part of strategic relationships.
Property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over three to ten years. We are currently using the straight-line method to depreciate assets.
Leases.
We lease buildings, machinery and equipment under operating leases for original terms ranging generally from 1 to 20years. Certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to 20years. These operating leases are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases." Capitalized software.
We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over three to five years when development is complete.
Impairment of long-lived assets.
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Employee compensation and benefits Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $133million as of October31, 2006 and $145million as of October31, 2005.
68 Foreign currency translation.
We follow SFAS No.52, "Foreign Currency Translation", for both the translation and remeasurement of balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates; revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.
For those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for nonmonetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income (loss).
2.New Accounting Pronouncements In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.123 (R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair value for all share-based payment awards including stock options, employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans, non-vested share awards (restricted stock) and stock appreciation rights. SFAS No.123 (R)supersedes our previous accounting under APB No.25. In March2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No.107, which provides the Staff's views regarding implementation issues related to SFAS No.123 (R).
We adopted the provisions of SFAS No.123 (R)using the modified prospective transition method beginning November1, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006. In accordance with that transition method, we have not restated prior periods for the effect of compensation expense calculated under SFAS No.123 (R). We have selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all our awards, except for the non-vested performance shares under the LTPP. For the LTPP, we are using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate grant date fair value as required by SFAS No.123 (R). Compensation expense for all share-based equity awards issued after November1, 2005 is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. For awards issued prior to November1, 2005, we are recognizing compensation expense based on the accelerated method described in FASB Interpretation No.28 "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans" ("FIN No.28"). The adoption of SFAS No.123 (R)also requires additional accounting related to income taxes and earnings per share as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from share-based compensation. The adoption of SFAS No.123 (R)had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2006, and is expected to continue to materially impact our financial statements in the foreseeable future. See Note5, "Share-Based Compensation" for more information on the impact of the new standard.
In November2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") SFAS No.123 (R)-3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards," ("FSP SFAS No.123 (R)-3"). FSP SFAS No.123 (R)-3 provides a practical exception when a company transitions to the accounting requirements in SFAS No.123 (R). SFAS No.123 (R)requires a company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting SFAS No.123 (R)(termed the APIC Pool), assuming the company had been following the recognition provisions prescribed by SFAS No.123. We have elected to use the guidance in FSP SFAS No.123 (R)-3 69 to calculate our APIC Pool. FSP SFAS No.123 (R)-3 was effective immediately. The adoption of the FSP did not have an impact on our overall results of operations or financial position.
In June2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No.06-3, "How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)," ("EITF No.06-3"). EITF No.06-3 requires disclosure of accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of point-of-sales taxes such as sales tax and value-added tax. If taxes included in gross revenues are significant, the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented should also be disclosed. EITF No.06-3 will be effective for the first annual or interim reporting period after December15, 2006. EITF No.06-3 requires retrospective application. We will be adopting this pronouncement beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, and we do not expect it to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In July2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.48, "Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties" ("FIN No.48"). FIN No.48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained by the taxing authority and provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN No.48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN No.48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. The differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN No.48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No.48 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No.157"). SFAS No.157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. SFAS No.157 applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards (except for measurements of share-based payments) and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements. SFAS No.157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS No.157 will be applied prospectively with some exceptions that will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No.157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS No.158"), which requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets. Except for the measurement date requirement, SFAS No.158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2006. The measurement date requirement will not be effective until fiscal years ending after December15, 2008. SFAS No.158 will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.158 on our consolidated financial position.
70 In September2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB No.108"). SAB No.108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year's financial statements are materially misstated. SAB No.108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November15, 2006 with earlier adoption encouraged and will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are currently evaluating the impact of SAB No.108 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
3.Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business On December1, 2005, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to Avago TechnologiesLtd. ("Avago"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA"), Agilent received approximately $2,559million in cash proceeds. The following table shows the components of the gain from sale of discontinued operations, net of taxes as of October31, 2006: (in millions) Proceeds, net of working capital adjustments $ 2,559 Book value of net assets disposed of (707 ) Costs of disposition, net (36 ) Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,816 Income taxes 6 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net $ 1,810 Subsequent to the quarter ended January31, 2006, we adjusted the gain on sale of discontinued operations by $23million which includes $21million for working capital and other adjustments and $2million for the disposal of fixed assets. The $36million costs of disposition are reported net of a gain of $51million for pension curtailments and settlements. The tax impact of the sale of our semiconductor products business reflects the utilization of the valuation allowance within the U.S. and a low effective tax rate in other jurisdictions.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect our semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." 71 The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business for the periods ended October31 included in the consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended October31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net revenue $ 141 $ 1,796 $ 2,021 Costs, expenses and other income (expense), net 133 1,564 1,779 Income from discontinued operations 8 232 242 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,816   Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations before taxes 1,824 232 242 Provision for income taxes 8 46  Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations, net $ 1,816 $ 186 $ 242 The following table presents Agilent's semiconductor products business assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations: October 31, 2005 (inmillions) Assets: Accounts receivable $ 219 Inventory 178 Other current assets 26 Current assets of discontinued operations 423 Property, plant and equipment, net 277 Goodwill and other intangible assets, net 99 Other assets 43 Non-current assets of discontinued operations 419 Total assets of discontinued operations $ 842 Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 121 Employee compensation and benefits 22 Other current liabilities 7 Current liabilities of discontinued operations $ 150 72 The following table presents Agilent's semiconductor products business's book value of net assets disposed of as of November30, 2005: November30, 2005 (In millions) Assets: Cash $ 4 Accounts receivable 219 Inventory 185 Other current assets 21 Current assets of discontinued operations 429 Property, plant and equipment, net 277 Goodwill and other intangible assets, net 98 Other assets 53 Non-current assets of discontinued operations 428 Total assets of discontinued operations $ 857 Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 115 Employee compensation and benefits 17 Other current liabilities 11 Current liabilities of discontinued operations 143 Other long term liabilities 7 Long term liabilities of discontinued operations 7 Total liabilities of discontinued operations $ 150 Book value of net assets disposed of $ 707 In accordance with SFAS No.142 "Goodwill and other Intangibles" ("SFAS No.142"), approximately $98million of goodwill associated with the semiconductor products business was eliminated and recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale of discontinued operations.
Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago are generally limited to 10percent of the purchase price and survive until March31, 2007.
4.Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business On August15, 2005, Agilent announced its intention to separate its semiconductor test solutions business, Verigy, into a stand-alone publicly traded company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of 8.7million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds of $121million. As part of the offering, Agilent made a payment to 73 Verigy of $19million, the amount by which the net IPO proceeds were insufficient to complete the agreed-upon Verigy initial capitalization of $140million. Following the offering, Agilent owned approximately 50million shares or 85percent of Verigy's ordinary shares. As a result of the IPO, Agilent recorded additional paid-in capital of $74million related to the excess of the IPO price over the book value of the shares sold. Underwriter fees related to the IPO were approximately $9million which were netted against the proceeds. Agilent recorded direct IPO costs of $2million within operating expenses related to third-party legal fees, filing fees and other services.
On October31, 2006, Agilent completed the spin-off of Verigy by distributing its remaining 85percent equity interest in Verigy to Agilent stockholders. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro rata non-cash dividend to Agilent stockholders, which reduced retained earnings by $310million. In the distribution, Agilent distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of close of market on October16, 2006. In the aggregate, Agilent distributed 50million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent stockholders. Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October31, 2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value of the shares distributed in the distribution was approximately $840million. The historical results of Verigy have been reflected as discontinued operations in the underlying financial statements and related disclosures for all periods presented.
The following table summarizes results from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business for the presented periods ended October31 included in the consolidated statement of operations: Years Ended October31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Net revenue $ 777 $ 454 $ 604 Costs and expenses 703 489 522 Income (loss) from discontinued operations 74 (35 ) 82 Other income (expense), net  (2 )  Income (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes 74 (37 ) 82 Provision for income taxes 20 13 14 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 54 $ (50 ) $ 68 74 The following table presents Agilent's semiconductor test solutions business assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations as of October31, 2005: October31, 2005 (in millions) Assets: Cash $  Accounts receivable 75 Inventory 110 Other current assets 10 Current assets of discontinued operations 195 Property, plant and equipment, net 18 Goodwill and other intangible assets, net 17 Other assets 17 Non-current assets of discontinued operations 52 Total assets of discontinued operations $ 247 Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 21 Employee compensation and benefits 20 Other current liabilities 63 Current liabilities of discontinued operations 104 Other long term liabilities 12 Long term liabilities of discontinued operations 12 Total liabilities of discontinued operations $ 116 75 The following table presents Agilent's book value of net assets eliminated due to the distribution as of October31, 2006: October31, 2006 (Inmillions) Assets: Cash $ 300 Accounts receivable 105 Inventory 87 Other current assets 2 Total current assets 494 Property, plant and equipment, net 44 Goodwill and other intangible assets, net 18 Other assets 42 Total Non-current assets 104 Total assets $ 598 Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 71 Employee compensation and benefits 43 Other current liabilities 92 Total Current liabilities 206 Other long term liabilities 89 Total Long term liabilities 89 Total liabilities $ 295 Book value of net assets distributed $ 303 Prior to the distribution of Verigy shares, Verigy and Agilent, and, in some cases, their respective subsidiaries, entered into agreements providing for the June1, 2006 separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent, including a master separation and distribution agreement. These agreements cover a variety of matters, including the transfer, ownership and licensing of intellectual property and other assets and liabilities relating to Verigy's businesses, the use of shared facilities, employee and tax-related matters and the transitional services Agilent will provide to Verigy. In addition, an ancillary agreement provided for a $25million revolving credit facility from Agilent to Verigy on the separation date with interest at one-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points. All amounts were repaid back and the credit facility has expired. The agreements relating to the separation from Agilent have been negotiated in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship. Per the transitional services agreement, the majority of the services Agilent provided to Verigy upon separation terminated prior to the distribution date.
Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might 76 arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June1, 2006.
5.Share-Based Compensation Effective November1, 2005, Agilent adopted the provisions of SFAS No.123 (R)which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTPP based on estimated fair values. Agilent previously applied the provisions of APB No.25 and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No.123").
Description of Share-Based Plans Employee stock purchase plans.
Effective November1, 2000, we adopted the ESPP. Under the provisions of the ESPP, eligible employees may contribute up to ten percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85percent of the lower of the fair market value at the entry date or the purchase date as defined by the ESPP. The ESPP has a maximum contractual term of two years. As of October31, 2006, securities authorized and available for issuance in connection with our ESPP were 23,341,919. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding common stock of Agilent or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP exceed 75million shares.
Incentive compensation plans.
On September17, 1999, we adopted the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 1999 Stock Plan (the "Stock Plan") and subsequently reserved 67,800,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the Stock Plan. In addition, on May31, 2000, 19,000,000 shares of our common stock were registered pursuant to converted stock options previously granted by HP. In February2001, our stockholders approved an additional 45,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the Stock Plan. These shares were subsequently registered in May2002. At October31, 2006, shares registered and available for option and restricted stock grants were 36,639,572.
Stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash awards may be granted under the Stock Plan. Options granted under the Stock Plan may be either "incentive stock options", as defined in section422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant and generally have a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted.
On March4, 2003, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock Plan. The amendment permitted the company to offer a one-time exchange of options issued under the Stock Plan having an exercise price greater than $25 for a lesser number of options to be granted at least six months and one day from the cancellation of surrendered options (the "Option Exchange Program"). On May20, 2003, we implemented the Option Exchange Program by filing a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC, which 77 allowed eligible employees a one-time opportunity to exchange options to purchase shares of the company's common stock, whether vested or unvested, which were granted under our Stock Plan, with exercise prices greater than $25 per share. The Option Exchange Program was offered from May20, 2003 to June18, 2003 and options to purchase approximately 26million shares were exchanged, with an average exercise price of $51. As a result, the company issued options to purchase approximately 13.8million shares at a weighted-average exercise price of $28 per share during the first quarter of 2004. Under the provisions of APB No.25 no compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for issuance of the replacement options for fiscal years ended 2005 and 2004. As a result of the SFAS No.123 (R)adoption, in fiscal year ended 2006, we recognized approximately $3million in our consolidated statement of operations for the issuance of these replacement options.
Effective November1, 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the LTPP for the company's executive officers and other key employees beginning in 2006. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets are met. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP plan is three years. The following table summarizes the shares approved by the Compensation Committee to be issued under the LTPP: Period Approved Shares Year To Be Awarded November 18, 2003 322,000 2007 November 16, 2004 475,000 2008 November 15, 2005 216,600 2009 January 17, 2006 227,834 2009 November 15, 2006 438,183 2010 In all cases, the final award may vary as it is based on certain performance metrics. We consider the dilutive impact of this program in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are met.
Pro forma Information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of SFAS No.123 (R) Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123 (R), Agilent provided the disclosures required under SFAS No.123, as amended by SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosures." No employee share-based compensation expense was reflected in our results from continuing operations in 2005 and 2004 for employee stock option awards as all options were granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Our ESPP was deemed non-compensatory under the provisions of APB No.25. Compensation expense for the non-vested performance shares granted under the LTPP was recognized based on the grant date fair value for the respective grants. Forfeitures of awards were recognized as they occurred. We recorded APB No.25 compensation expense in continuing operations of $8million in 2005 and $7million in 2004. The APB No.25 compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 primarily related to our LTPP. In August2005 our Board of Directors approved a modification to the terms of the options held by employees of our semiconductor products business to effect the acceleration of vesting for all unvested options held by employees of that business, effective as of the date of the sale of the semiconductor products business to Avago. In connection with this modification, we recorded $8million of compensation expense in discontinued operations.
78 The pro forma information for share-based compensation in 2005 and 2004 was as follows: Years Ended October31, 2005 2004 (in millions, except per share data) Net income  as reported $ 327 $ 369 APB No. 25 compensation recognized in net income, as reported 16 7 SFAS No. 123 based compensation (228 ) (256 ) Tax benefit 12 17 Net income  pro forma $ 127 $ 137 Net income per share: As reported: Basic $ 0.66 $ 0.76 Diluted $ 0.65 $ 0.75 Pro forma: Basic $ 0.26 $ 0.28 Diluted $ 0.25 $ 0.28 The pro forma results in 2005 and 2004 include approximately $32million and $70million of pro forma compensation expense relating to our Option Exchange Program, respectively. The remainder of the expense for those periods related to awards granted over the previous four years.
Due to the valuation allowance provided on our net deferred tax assets as described in Note8, "Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations", we did not record any tax benefits attributable to pro forma share-based compensation expenses for employees in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions in 2005 and 2004. The tax impact presented above was computed for both the APB No.25 and SFAS No.123 share-based compensation expense.
Impact of SFAS No.123 (R) Agilent adopted SFAS No.123 (R)using the modified prospective transition method beginning November1, 2005. Accordingly, in 2006, we recorded share-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of November1, 2005 as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under SFAS No.123 were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The effect of forfeitures on the unamortized compensation expense of pre-adoption awards was not material. For these awards, we have continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method under FIN No.28. For share-based awards granted after November1, 2005 we have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under SFAS No.123 (R). For these awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As SFAS No.123 (R)requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation in 2006 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Amounts previously reported prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123 (R)have not been restated.
79 The impact on our results for share-based compensation in 2006 was as follows: Year Ended October31, 2006 (inmillions,except per share data) Cost of products and services $ 27 Research and development 17 Selling, general and administrative 50 Share-based compensation expense in continuing operations $ 94 Share-based compensation expense in discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business 3 Share-based compensation expense in discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business 9 Share-based compensation expense  Agilent awards 106 Share-based compensation expense in discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business  Verigy awards 2 Total share-based compensation expense $ 108 Impact on continuing operations per share: Basic $ 0.22 Diluted $ 0.21 Impact on discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business per share: Basic $ 0.01 Diluted $ 0.01 Impact on discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business  Agilent and Verigy awards per share: Basic $ 0.02 Diluted $ 0.02 Impact on net income per share: Basic $ 0.25 Diluted $ 0.24 At October31, 2006 there was no share-based compensation capitalized within inventory as it was immaterial. Total income tax benefit recognized in 2006 in the statement of operations for share-based compensation was immaterial. The weighted average grant date fair value of options, as determined under SFAS No.123 (R), granted in 2006 was $10.46 per share. The total fair value of shares vested in 2006 was $216million. In 2006 the windfall tax benefit realized from exercised stock options and similar awards was immaterial. As of October31, 2006, the total unrecorded deferred share-based compensation balance for non-vested shares, net of expected forfeitures, was approximately $88million which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.3years.
Included in income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No.123 (R)for the fiscal year ended 2006 is approximately $3million of share-based compensation expense in connection with the 2005 modification to the terms of the options held by employees of our divested semiconductor products business.
80 Included in income from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business and recorded under the provisions of SFAS No.123 (R)is $9million of share-based compensation expense for Agilent options held by Verigy employees and $2million of new Verigy awards that were issued prior to the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent. As a result of the final distribution of Verigy shares by Agilent which took place on October31, 2006, non-vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees were cancelled. Vested Agilent stock options held by Verigy employees will have a period of up to three months in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. Retirement eligible Verigy employees will have a period of up to three years in which to exercise the Agilent options before such options are cancelled. To the extent that the Agilent options were not vested as of the distribution date, Verigy issued replacement Verigy awards.
Valuation Assumptions For all periods presented, the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards, restricted stock and employee stock purchases made under our ESPP was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In 2006, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. In 2005 and 2004, shares granted under the LTPP were valued using the variable accounting method under APB No.25.
The weighted average assumptions used for options granted, ESPP purchases and the LTPP in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 Stock Option Plans: Risk-free interest rate 4.4 % 3.6 % 3.3 % Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Volatility 29 % 39 % 57 % Expected life 4.25 yrs 4 yrs 5.5 yrs ESPP: Risk-free interest rate 4.5 % 2.4 % 1.2 % Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Volatility 29 % 37 % 36 % Expected life 0.5-1 yrs 0.5-2 yrs 0.5-1 yrs LTPP: Volatility of Agilent shares 28 % N/A N/A Volatility of selected peer-company shares 23%-82 % N/A N/A Price-wise correlation with selected peers 50 % N/A N/A 81 Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Beginning November1, 2005, the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility for our stock. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123 (R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving our expected volatility assumption. We have determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a combined method of determining volatility. We consider several factors in estimating the expected life of our options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe are representative of future behavior.
Share-Based Payment Award Activity The following table summarizes equity share-based payment award activity in 2006: Available For Grant Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price (in thousands) Outstanding at October 31, 2003 72,239 51,366 $ 29 Granted (12,136 ) 12,136 $ 32 Granted under Option Exchange Program (13,797 ) 13,797 $ 28 Exercised  (2,859 ) $ 19 Cancelled 2,630 (2,630 ) $ 41 Plan Shares Expired  (834 ) $ 37 Outstanding at October 31, 2004 48,936 70,976 $ 29 Granted (11,231 ) 11,231 $ 22 Exercised  (5,182 ) $ 21 Cancelled 3,779 (3,779 ) $ 34 Plan Shares Expired  (706 ) $ 36 Outstanding at October 31, 2005 41,484 72,540 $ 28 Granted (8,474 ) 8,474 $ 34 Exercised  (18,821 ) $ 25 Cancelled 2,494 (2,494 ) $ 36 Plan Shares Expired  (635 ) $ 42 Cancelled  semiconductor products business 439 (439 ) $ 45 Plan Shares Expired  semiconductor products business  (480 ) $ 44 Cancelled  semiconductor test solutions business 1,185 (1,185 ) $ 29 Plan Shares Expired  semiconductor test solutions business  (200 ) $ 45 Outstanding at October 31, 2006 37,128 56,760 $ 29 82 The plan shares expired per the above table represent cancelled options granted under the HP stock option plan that are not added back to our available for grant options as the plan shares expire after cancellation and are not reissuable.
Forfeited and expired options in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Forfeited 1,011 $ 26 Expired 2,453 $ 46 Total Options Cancelled at October 31, 2004 3,464 $ 40 Forfeited 1,640 $ 25 Expired 2,845 $ 38 Total Options Cancelled at October 31, 2005 4,485 $ 33 Forfeited 2,048 $ 28 Expired 3,385 $ 43 Total Options Cancelled at October 31, 2006 5,433 $ 37 The options outstanding exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October31, 2006 were as follows: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number Exercisable Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) (in years) (in thousands) (in thousands) (in years) (in thousands) $0 - 15 786 5.6 $ 13 $ 18,030 781 5.6 $ 13 $ 17,936 $15.01 - 25 14,260 7.2 $ 20 $ 226,586 7,303 6.7 $ 19 $ 122,369 $25.01 - 30 19,393 5.8 $ 27 $ 157,671 18,614 5.7 $ 27 $ 151,332 $30.01 - 40 18,127 7.1 $ 34 $ 33,542 7,540 5.0 $ 35 $ 12,238 $40.01 - 50 2,393 2.4 $ 44  2,393 2.4 $ 44  $50.01 and over 1,801 3.8 $ 65  1,801 3.8 $ 65  56,760 6.3 $ 29 $ 435,829 38,432 5.4 $ 30 $ 303,875 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $35.60 at October31, 2006, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date. The total number of in-the-money awards exercisable at October31, 2006 was approximately 33million.
83 The following table summarizes options exercised and the weighted average fair value of options granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004: Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted Average Exercise Price Value Using Black-Scholes Model (in millions) Options exercised during October 31, 2004 $ 30,743 $ 19 Black-Scholes value of options granted during 2004 $ 16 Options exercised during October 31, 2005 $ 42,656 $ 21 Black-Scholes value of options granted during 2005 $ 8 Options exercised during October 31, 2006 $ 195,938 $ 25 Black-Scholes value of options granted during 2006 $ 10 The amount of cash received from the exercise of share-based awards granted was $547million in 2006, $198million in 2005 and $137million in 2004. See Note8, "Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations" for the tax impact on share-based award exercises.
6.Other Income (Expense), Net The following table presents the components of other income (expense), net in 2006, 2005 and 2004: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Interest income $ 178 $ 72 $ 27 Interest expense (69 ) (27 ) (36 ) Minority interest income (loss) (5 ) (10 ) (11 ) Rental income 18 29 25 Investment impairments (1 ) (18 ) (15 ) Investment gains 14 7  Government grants 2 7 10 Income from leases   6 Gain on sale of assets  6  Currency gain (loss) (2 ) 7 2 Income from Foreign Sales Corporation Tax Study 15   Loss on redemption of debt  (7 )  Other, net 13 9 16 Other income (expense), net $ 163 $ 75 $ 24 Interest income is derived principally from short-term commercial paper for our restricted investments and the investment of our surplus cash balances in bank time deposits and other money market instruments. Income from Foreign Sales Corporation Tax Study was earned pursuant to an agreement with Hewlett-Packard to provide assistance with a Foreign Sales Corporation Maximization 84 Study for years prior to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard. For its services, Agilent earned a fee which was contingent on related tax benefits being realized.
7.Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. ("Lumileds"), was a global joint venture between Agilent and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ("Philips") under a Second Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture Agreement"), dated as of November29, 2004, between Agilent and Philips. Lumileds manufactures high-power light emitting diodes and solid-state lighting solutions. Our ownership interest in Lumileds was approximately 47percent as of October31, 2005, after selling 1percent of our interest to Philips in the second quarter of 2005. Our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate including the gain on sale of our interest in Lumileds was $901million in 2006, $42million in 2005 and $29million in 2004.
On November28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, upon closure of the sale transaction, the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements were terminated. The purchase price paid by Philips under the Share Purchase Agreement was $949million. In addition, Lumileds repaid the $51million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest due to us as of the date of sale under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November30, 2001.
The following table shows the components of the gain from sale of Lumileds, net of income tax (in millions): Year Ended October 31, 2006 (in millions) Proceeds $ 949 Net book value of investments (48 ) Gain on sale before taxes 901 Income taxes  Gain from sale of Lumileds, net of taxes $ 901 The tax impact of the sale of our Lumileds joint venture primarily reflects the utilization of valuation allowances within the U.S.
85 8.Provision (Benefit) For Income Taxes From Continuing Operations The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations is comprised of: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) U.S. federal taxes from continuing operations: Current $ 1 $ 40 $  Deferred   1 Non-U.S. taxes from continuing operations: Current 95 109 72 Deferred (9 ) (10 ) (19 ) State taxes from continuing operations, net of federal benefit Current 4 3 3 Deferred    Total from continuing operations: $ 91 $ 142 $ 57 The federal and state provisions do not reflect tax savings resulting from deductions associated with our stock option plans.
The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: October 31, 2006 2005 Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities Deferred Tax Assets Deferred Tax Liabilities (in millions) Inventory $ 78 $ 2 $ 152 $  Property, plant and equipment  150 19 146 Warranty reserves 13 1 18  Retiree medical benefits 44  54 1 Other retirement benefits 34 99 52 92 Employee benefits, other than retirement 205  237  Net operating loss and credit carryforwards 470  1,314  Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries  305  301 Share-based compensation 17    Other 136 73 95 15 Subtotal 997 630 1,941 555 Tax valuation allowance (382 )  (1,371 )  $ 615 $ 630 $ 570 $ 555 86 The consolidated balance sheet reflects the allocation of the valuation allowance based on the pro-rata portion of gross current and non-current deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction where a valuation allowance is required. During 2003, we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the U.S. and selected entities in foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.109, which require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Cumulative losses incurred in the U.S. and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence to require full valuation allowances. We intend to maintain full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal.
At October31, 2006, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $256million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $145million. The federal net operating losses expire in years beginning 2007 through 2021, if not utilized. The federal tax credits expire beginning in 2007 through 2026, if not utilized. In addition, the company has state tax credit carryforwards of $133million. State tax credits of $18million expire beginning in 2007 through 2018, if not utilized. A portion of the federal and state net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. These annual loss limitations may result in the expiration or reduced utilization of the net operating losses and/or credits. At October31, 2006, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $390million. Of this foreign loss, $127million will expire in years beginning 2011 through 2014, if not utilized. The remaining $263million has an indefinite life. Some of the foreign losses are subject to annual loss limitation rules.
Net deferred tax assets of approximately $79million at October31, 2006 and approximately $32million at October31, 2005 pertain to net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. When recognized, the reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision.
The differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective tax rate from continuing operations are: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit .2 .6 1.1 Non-U.S. income taxed at different rates 2.5 26.9 38.1 Nondeductible goodwill   5.6 Research credits (.1 ) (2.9 ) (3.4 ) Extraterritorial income exclusion (.3 ) (3.2 ) (9.5 ) AJCA dividend repatriation  7.2  Hewlett-Packard settlement (1.8 )   Other, net .5 .4 (3.6 ) Valuation allowance (30.0 ) (21.4 ) (14.2 ) 6.0 % 42.6 % 49.1 % 87 The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) earnings from continuing operations before taxes are: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) U.S. continuing operations $ 867 $ 208 $ (140 ) Non-U.S. continuing operations 661 125 256 $ 1,528 $ 333 $ 116 The income tax provision for 2006 includes a benefit of $29million related to the resolution of domestic tax-related issues for years covered by a Tax Sharing Agreement between Agilent and Hewlett-Packard. The Tax Sharing Agreement is related to the 2000 spin-off of Agilent from Hewlett-Packard.
On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and reported an extraordinary dividend (as defined in the AJCA) of $970million and a related tax liability of approximately $48million in our fiscal 2005 federal and state income tax returns. For fiscal 2005, $23million of the $48million is provided for in the discontinuing operations' provision for income taxes while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations' provision for income taxes.
Agilent has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our policy is to continue to invest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the United States, with the exception of the amounts repatriated in the year ended October31, 2005 under the AJCA. If management decides to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period.
Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore, Malaysia and Switzerland. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. During the years 2003 through 2006, Agilent enjoyed tax holidays that applied to manufacturing income generated in Malaysia and Singapore. The tax holidays in both Malaysia and Singapore expire in 2013. In 2004, Agilent secured a reduced tax rate in Switzerland for income generated from activity that Agilent began in Switzerland during that year. The tax holiday expires in 2013. Also in 2004, Agilent secured an additional Singapore tax holiday for earnings from investments and related activity that began in 2004. The tax holiday applies to applicable earnings of Agilent until the end of 2013, with the opportunity for a reduced rate thereafter.
As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $76million, $54million and $96million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.17, $0.11 and $0.20 in 2006, 2005 and 2003, respectively.
88 We are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
9.Net Income (Loss) Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations for the periods presented below.
Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Numerator: Income from continuing operations $ 1,437 $ 191 $ 59 Income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations of our semiconductor products business 1,816 186 242 Income (loss) from discontinued operations of our semiconductor test solutions business 54 (50 ) 68 Net income $ 3,307 $ 327 $ 369 Denominators: Basic weighted average shares 431 494 483 Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents  stock options and other employee stock plans 10 6 7 Diluted weighted average shares 441 500 490 In computing diluted net income per share under the treasury stock method, we elected to use the transition election of FSP SFAS No.123 (R)-3 to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits as of the adoption of SFAS No.123 (R). For further details see Note2, "New Accounting Pronouncements." The total number of awards exercised in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 19million, 5million and 3million, respectively.
In connection with the October31, 2006 Verigy distribution, on November1, 2006 Agilent distributed .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of October16, 2006 to Agilent's stockholders. In addition, under the anti-dilution provision of the 1999 Stock Plan, on November1, 2006 Agilent adjusted the exercise price downward and number of option shares upward for each outstanding employee stock option to preserve the value of the options after the Verigy spin-off. For further details on the distribution see Note5, "Share-Based Compensation." 89 The following table presents options to purchase shares of common stock, which were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because they were anti-dilutive.
Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 Options to purchase shares of common stock (in millions) 8 49 41 Weighted-average exercise price $ 45 $ 33 $ 35 Average common stock price $ 34 $ 25 $ 27 The computation of diluted net income per share for the fiscal year 2004 does not include 36million shares issuable upon conversion of our then outstanding $1.15billion senior convertible debenture as the effect was not dilutive for this period, using the if-converted method pursuant to SFAS No.128, "Earnings per Share". Our convertible debt was redeemed as of September9, 2005 and therefore not part of the computation in 2006.
10.Supplemental Cash Flow Information Cash paid for income taxes was $156million in 2006, $75million in 2005 and $149million in 2004. Cash paid for interest was $55million in 2006, $44million in 2005 and $36million in 2004. In 2006, we spent $25million as debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt of $1.5billion and amortized $4million in interest expense during 2006.
Non cash transactions in 2005 primarily related to the conversion of approximately $466million of the principal amount of convertible debt into common stock. In addition, accrued interest of approximately $4million relating to the convertible debt was recorded in equity as part of the cost of the new shares issued. Non-cash transactions in 2004 related primarily to an acquisition in October2004 and we issued approximately 772,000 shares with an approximate value of $18million.
11.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents As of October31, 2006, $1,606million was reported as restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. Of this amount, $1,582million was short-term restricted commercial paper maintained in connection with our obligations to a counterparty pursuant to the Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation entered into on January27, 2006 and reported as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note21, "Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities." 12.Inventory October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Finished goods $ 285 $ 273 Work in progress 51 54 Raw materials 291 285 $ 627 $ 612 90 Inventory-related charges of $38million, $59million and $16million were recorded in total cost of products in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We record excess and obsolete inventory charges for both inventory on our site as well as inventory at our contract manufacturers and suppliers where we have non-cancelable purchase commitments.
13.Property, Plant and Equipment, Net October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Land $ 75 $ 84 Buildings and leasehold improvements 1,023 1,327 Machinery and equipment 863 807 Software 388 392 Total property, plant and equipment 2,349 2,610 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,574 ) (1,755 ) $ 775 $ 855 We sold our San Jose site for a total consideration of $88million and recorded a gain of $56million during the second quarter of 2006. In May2006, we completed the sale of our Palo Alto site for a total consideration of $98.5million and recorded a gain of $65million. Asset impairments other than restructuring were zero in 2006, $4million in 2005, and zero in 2004. Depreciation expenses for continuing operations were $141million in 2006, $163million in 2005 and $189million in 2004.
14.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The goodwill balances at October31, 2006 and 2005 and the movements in 2006 and 2005 for each of our reportable segments are shown in the table below: Electronic Measurement Bio- analytical Measurement Total Goodwill at October 31, 2004 $ 267 $ 39 $ 306 Foreign currency translation impact (19 )  (19 ) Goodwill arising from acquisitions 7 13 20 Goodwill at October 31, 2005 255 52 307 Foreign currency translation impact 1 1 2 Goodwill arising from acquisitions 16 60 76 Goodwill at October 31, 2006 $ 272 $ 113 $ 385 91 The component parts of other intangibles assets at October31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in the table below: Other Intangible Assets Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value (in millions) As of October 31, 2006: Purchased technology $ 208 $ 143 $ 65 Customer relationships 50 32 18 Total $ 258 $ 175 $ 83 As of October 31, 2005: Purchased technology $ 151 $ 124 $ 27 Customer relationships 38 27 11 Total $ 189 $ 151 $ 38 We purchased $69million of other intangibles and recorded $76million of goodwill during 2006.
In February2006, we acquired the remaining 49percent minority interest in Yokogawa Analytical Systems, a joint venture between Agilent and Yokogawa Electrical Corporation. This acquisition resulted in the recording of $43million in intangible assets and $60million of goodwill. In addition, during 2006 we recorded two acquisitions, one earn out payment on an acquisition completed in 2005, and one joint venture buyout payment. Pro forma disclosures are not presented for these transactions as they were not material.
Amortization of intangible assets was $24million in 2006, $13million in 2005 and $17million in 2004. Future amortization expense related to existing intangible assets is estimated to be $27million in 2007, $19million in 2008, $12million in 2009, $10million in 2010, $7million in 2011 and $8million thereafter.
15.Investments Investments in cost basis and equity method investments and securities classified as trading securities or available-for-sale and included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet were as follows at October31, 2006 and 2005 (net book value): October31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Investments in and advances to equity method investees $  $ 119 Cost method investments 34 31 Trading securities 62 53 Available-for-sale investments (original cost of $62 million in 2006 and $54 million in 2005) 76 66 Total $ 172 $ 269 92 Cost method investments consist of non-marketable equity securities and are accounted for at historical cost. For investments where we have significant influence over the investee, the equity method of accounting is used. Agilent's proportionate share of income or loss for equity method investments was recorded currently in earnings. Trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in operating earnings. Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in stockholders' equity.
All of our investments (excluding trading securities) are subject to periodic impairment review. However, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment.
Charges related to other than temporary impairments were $1million in 2006, $18million in 2005 and $15million in 2004. These impairment charges were recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Unrealized gains and losses on our trading securities portfolio were $6million gain in 2006 and $5million gain in both 2005 and 2004. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities was $9million in 2006, $8million in 2005 and zero in 2004. Realized gains and losses from the sale of held-to-maturity securities was $2million in 2006, zero in 2005 and zero in 2004.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we sold our remaining interest in Lumileds to Philips. See Note7, "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Gain on Sale Lumileds "for further details.
16.Retirement Plans and Post Retirement Pension Plans General.
Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits and a death benefit under the Agilent Survivor Protection Plan for our eligible U.S. employees.
Agilent provides U.S. employees, who meet eligibility criteria under the retirement and deferred profit-sharing plans, defined benefits which are generally based on an employee's highest five consecutive years' average pay during the years of employment and on length of service. For eligible service through October31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under our defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"), which was closed to new participants as of November1993.
As of October31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of plan assets and the total projected benefit obligation of the DPSP for U.S. Agilent Employees were $726million and $826million, respectively.
Eligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. Our U.S. retirees who retired prior to January1, 2005, are also covered by a lump sum death benefit that is part of the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan. In July2004, the Retiree Survivor's Benefit Plan was revised to eliminate the $5,000 Retiree Survivor Benefit for all U.S. retirees who retire on or after January1, 2005.
93 401(k) defined contribution plan.
Our U.S. eligible employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies,Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Enrollment in the 401(k) Plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. Under the 401(k) Plan, we provide matching contributions to employees up to a maximum of 4percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation. The maximum contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory and plan limitations. The 401(k) Plan expense included in income (loss) from continuing operations was $26million in 2006, $25million in 2005 and $25million in 2004.
Post-retirement medical benefit plans.
In addition to receiving pension benefits, our U.S. employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in our Non-Medicare Medical or Medicare Medical Plans (the "Post-retirement Medical Plans") under the Agilent Health Plan. Current U.S. employees may become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees. Once participating in a medical plan, retirees may choose from managed-care and indemnity options, with their contributions dependent on the options chosen and length of service.
Plan amendments.
In July2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved design changes to Agilent's Post-retirement Medical Plans. One option available to existing post-65 retirees is a new Medicare Supplement Plan in 2005. The Medicare Supplement Plan supplements Medicare coverage by reimbursing Medicare Parts A and B deductibles at 100percent after Medicare pays its portion of the retiree's expenses. The Post-retirement Medical Plan for a majority of future retirees was revised to establish retiree medical accounts for the benefit of such retirees and will be funded with amounts as determined by Agilent.
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
In December2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was passed which expands Medicare to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006. In May2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003", which provides guidance on how companies should account for the impact of the Act on its postretirement healthcare plans. Beginning in 2006, the federal government provides a non-taxable subsidy to employers that sponsor prescription drug benefits to retirees that are "actuarially equivalent" to Medicare PartD benefits. We have determined that the prescription drug benefits offered under our plans qualify for this subsidy and assuming that we will continue to offer these benefits, we have reflected the expected subsidy according to the guidance in FSP 106-2 prospectively in our financial statements. The adoption of FSP 106-2 had no material impact on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net plan costs.
94 Components of net periodic cost.
For the years ended October31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our net pension and post-retirement benefit costs were comprised of: Pensions U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plans U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Service cost  benefits earned during the period $ 45 $ 63 $ 63 $ 45 $ 44 $ 41 $ 5 $ 6 $ 12 Interest cost on benefit obligation 39 40 39 58 58 52 28 29 32 Expected return on plan assets (51 ) (50 ) (45 ) (81 ) (73 ) (65 ) (27 ) (25 ) (25 ) Amortization and deferrals: Actuarial loss (3 ) 2 3 34 31 33 7 9 6 Prior service cost 1 1 1    (11 ) (13 ) (5 ) Net plan costs 31 56 61 56 60 61 2 6 20 Curtailments and settlements (42 )   (11 )   (38 )   Total net plan costs $ (11 ) $ 56 $ 61 $ 45 $ 60 $ 61 $ (36 ) $ 6 $ 20 Summary of net plan costs: Continuing operations $ 29 $ 45 $ 49 $ 50 $ 56 $ 57 $ 2 $ 5 $ 16 Discontinued operations 2 11 12 6 4 4  1 4 Summary of Curtailments and Settlements: Continuing operations (11 )      (12 )   Discontinued operations (31 )   (11 )   (26 )   Total net plan costs $ (11 ) $ 56 $ 61 $ 45 $ 60 $ 61 $ (36 ) $ 6 $ 20 As of December1, 2005, due to the divestiture of the semiconductor products business, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No.88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," ("SFAS No.88") and as required under the SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("SFAS No.106"). The impact to the U.S. Plans and the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan was curtailment gains of $22million and $21million, recorded in discontinued operations. The impact on the Non-U.S. Plans was a settlement gain of $8million recorded in discontinued operations.
Due to the separation of our semiconductor test solutions business into a separate legal company, Verigy, as of June1, 2006, and due to significant workforce reductions, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No.88 and SFAS No.106 in the third quarter. The impact to the U.S. Plans was a curtailment gain of $12million consisting of curtailment gain of $3million for continuing operations and curtailment gain of $9million for discontinued operations as well as a $4million settlement gain relating to continuing operations. The impact to the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan was a curtailment gain of $12million for continuing operations. The impact to the Non-U.S. Plans was a curtailment loss of $1million and a settlement gain of $4million, that were recorded in discontinued operations.
In the U.S., because of additional workforce reductions along with cessation of retiree medical benefits for Verigy employees as of October31, 2006, we recorded curtailments and settlements as required by SFAS No.88 and SFAS No.106 in the fourth quarter. The impact to the U.S. Plans was 95 curtailment gains of $2million and a settlement gain of $2million both of which were for continuing operations. For the U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plan, we recorded a curtailment gain of $5million which was for discontinued operations.
Funded status.
As of October31, 2006 and 2005, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was: U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S.
Defined Benefit Plans U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plans 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 (in millions) Change in fair value of plan assets: Fair value  beginning of year $ 628 $ 564 $ 1,283 $ 1,109 $ 313 $ 300 Actual return on plan assets 94 67 127 208 48 35 Employer contributions 41 41 76 34   Participants' contributions   5 5   Benefits paid (3 ) (47 ) (39 ) (29 ) (17 ) (22 ) Transfer from DPSP 1 3     Settlements (121 )      Distribution of semiconductor test solutions business   (30 )    Currency impact   42 (44 )   Fair value  end of year $ 640 $ 628 $ 1,464 $ 1,283 $ 344 $ 313 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation  beginning of year $ 746 $ 718 $ 1,421 $ 1,189 $ 509 $ 503 Service cost 45 62 45 44 5 6 Interest cost 39 40 58 57 28 28 Participants' contributions   5 5   Plan amendment    (13 )   Actuarial (gain) loss 1 (30 ) (8 ) 217 (38 ) 28 Benefits paid (3 ) (47 ) (39 ) (29 ) (16 ) (22 ) Transfer from DPSP 1 3     Curtailments (36 )    (21 )  Settlements (121 )  (17 )    Distribution of semiconductor test solutions business   (52 )    Impact of Medicare Act      (34 ) Currency impact   53 (49 )   Benefit obligation  end of year $ 672 $ 746 $ 1,466 $ 1,421 $ 467 $ 509 Benefit obligation in excess of plan assets $ (32 ) $ (118 ) $ (2 ) $ (138 ) $ (123 ) $ (196 ) Unrecognized net actuarial (gain) loss (63 ) (30 ) $ 297 391 59 146 Unrecognized prior service cost (benefit) related to plan changes  1 (17 ) (18 ) (79 ) (128 ) Net (accrued) prepaid costs $ (95 ) $ (147 ) $ 278 $ 235 $ (143 ) $ (178 ) Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of: Prepaid defined benefit plan costs   $ 180 $ 127   Accrued defined benefit plan costs $ (95 ) $ (147 ) (16 ) (66 )   Intangible assets   2 4   Additional minimum pension liability   112 170   Accrued post-retirement benefits costs     (143 ) (178 ) Net (accrued) prepaid costs $ (95 ) $ (147 ) $ 278 $ 235 $ (143 ) $ (178 ) 96 Investment policies and strategies as of October31, 2005 and 2006.
Plan assets consist primarily of publicly-traded stocks and bonds. In the U.S., our Agilent Retirement Plan and post-retirement benefit assets are allocated approximately 80percent to equities and approximately 20percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP assets are allocated approximately 60percent to equities and approximately 40percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 10percent of our U.S. equity portfolio consists of alternative investments, largely private equity partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. The safety and protection of principal is a primary concern, and we believe that a well-diversified investment portfolio will result in the highest attainable investment return (income plus capital appreciation) with the lowest overall risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our assets are allocated from 50 to 70percent to equities, from 25 to 50percent to fixed income investments, and from 0 to 5percent to real estate investments, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. The actual allocations of plan assets are consistent with the target allocations.
The table below presents the projected benefit obligation ("PBO"), accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") and fair value of plan assets in the aggregate for all plans, separately showing those that were considered under-funded as of October31, 2006 or 2005.
2006 2005 Benefit Obligation Fair Value of Plan Assets Benefit Obligation Fair Value of Plan Assets (in millions) PBO PBO U.S defined benefit plans where PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets $ 672 $ 640 $ 746 $ 628 Non-U.S. defined benefit plans where PBO exceeds the fair value of plan assets $ 1,112 $ 985 $ 1,118 $ 904 Non-U.S. defined benefit plans where fair value of plan assets exceeds PBO 354 479 303 379 Total $ 1,466 $ 1,464 $ 1,421 $ 1,283 97 ABO ABO U.S defined benefit plans where ABO exceeds the fair value of plan assets $ 25  $ 23  U.S defined benefit plans where the fair value of plan assets exceeds ABO 490 640 517 628 Total $ 515 $ 640 $ 540 628 Non-U.S. defined benefit plans where ABO exceeds the fair value of plan assets $ 649 $ 632 $ 852 787 Non-U.S. defined benefit plans where fair value of plan assets exceeds ABO 656 832 400 496 Total $ 1,305 $ 1,464 $ 1,252 $ 1,283 Additional Minimum Liability.
An additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2005 for three pension plans in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated comprehensive loss was $170million, which was partially offset by $20million applied to deferred tax assets, net of tax valuation allowance. The large impact on accumulated comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions", for the impacted countries.
On June1, 2006, in accordance with the separation agreement between Agilent and Verigy, the liability for certain Verigy employee pension benefits was transferred to separate Verigy pension plans. Agilent funded the pension liability to the extent of the accumulated benefit obligation out of operating cash. The funded status of the Non-U.S. plans required us to reverse $58million of the additional minimum liability along with the related deferred tax impacts, of approximately $20million.
An additional minimum pension liability adjustment was required in 2006 for two pension plans in Europe as the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets for those plans as of the measurement date. The impact of the additional minimum liability on accumulated comprehensive gain (loss) was $112million which was partially offset by $34million applied to deferred tax assets. The large impact on accumulated comprehensive income was primarily a result of prepaid costs that were reduced to zero in accordance with SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions", for the impacted countries.
Contributions and estimated future benefit payments.
During fiscal year 2007, we expect to contribute zero to the U.S. defined benefit plans, $39million to plans outside the U.S., and zero to the 98 Post-retirement Medical Plans. The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10years: U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S.
Defined Benefit Plans U.S. Post Retirement Benefit Plans (in millions) 2007 $ 32 $ 29 $ 23 2008 $ 34 $ 31 $ 25 2009 $ 41 $ 34 $ 26 2010 $ 50 $ 37 $ 28 2011 $ 60 $ 40 $ 29 2012-2016 $ 245 $ 251 $ 160 Assumptions.
The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the table below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based, on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans October31 for the U.S. plans and September30 for the non-U.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against the cash flows from a hypothetically constructed portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as a proxy for setting the discount rate. The non-U.S. rates were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.
99 Assumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost in each year were as follows: For years ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 5.75% 5.75% 6.25% Average increase in compensation levels 4.0% 4.0% 4.25% Expected long-term return on assets 8.5% 8.5% 8.75% Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 2.25-5.0% 2.25-5.75% 2.0-5.5% Average increase in compensation levels 0-4.0% 2.5-4.25% 2.5-4.0% Expected long-term return on assets 4.5-7.0% 4.5-7.5% 5.0-7.5% U.S. post-retirement benefits plans: Discount rate 5.75% 5.75% 6.25% Expected long-term return on assets 8.5% 8.5% 8.75% Current medical cost trend rate 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% Ultimate medical cost trend rate 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2011 2010 2009 Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation and the resulting additional minimum pension liability were as follows: As of the years ending October 31, 2006 2005 U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 6.0% 5.75% Average increase in compensation levels 4.0% 4.0% Expected long-term return on assets 8.5% 8.5% Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Discount rate 2.25-5.0% 2.25-5.0% Average increase in compensation levels 0-4.25% 0-4.0% Expected long-term return on assets 4.5-7.0% 4.5-7.0% U.S. post-retirement benefits plans: Discount rate 6.0% 5.75% Expected long-term return on assets 8.5% 8.5% Current medical cost trend rate 10.0% 10.0% Ultimate medical cost trend rate 5.0% 5.0% Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2012 2011 100 Assumed health care trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Post-retirement Medical Plans. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates for the year ended October31, 2006 would have the following effects: One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 4 $ (3 ) Effect on post-retirement benefit obligations $ 52 $ (44 ) 17.Guarantees Standard Warranty A summary of the standard warranty accrual activity in 2006 and 2005 is shown in the table below.
October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Balance as of October 31, 2005 and 2004 $ 40 $ 52 Accruals for warranties issued during the period 50 49 Accruals related to pre-existing warranties (including changes in estimates) (2 ) 8 Settlements made during the period (59 ) (69 ) Balance as of October 31, 2006 and 2005 $ 29 $ 40 Extended Warranty Revenue from our extended warranty contracts with terms beyond one year is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. Amounts representing warranty contracts for the next twelve months are included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and were $43million and $26million at October31, 2006 and October31, 2005, respectively. The long-term amounts are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and were $55million and $50million at October31, 2006 and October31, 2005, respectively. Also see Note20, "Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities." October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Balance as of October 31, 2005 and 2004 $ 76 $ 45 Deferral of revenue for new contracts 51 45 Recognition of revenue (29 ) (14 ) Balance as of October 31, 2006 and 2005 $ 98 $ 76 101 Lease Guarantees During the quarter ended April30, 2005 we entered into an amended Vendor Finance agreement with CIT GroupInc. (formerly Tyco Capital Corporation) that released Agilent from substantially all credit guarantees. As part of this agreement Agilent was also released of liability relating to the guarantees that could require us to repurchase individual leases if the documentation we provided to support the lease was not materially accurate. The impact of the agreement was not material.
Indemnifications to Avago In connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in December2005, we agreed to indemnify Avago, its affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to Avago, as well as pre-closing taxes and other specified items. Agilent's indemnification for representations and warranties made to Avago are generally limited to 10percent of the purchase price and survive until March31, 2007. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2006.
Indemnifications to Verigy In connection with the spin-off of Verigy, we agreed to indemnify Verigy and its affiliates against certain damages which it might incur in the future. These indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent did not transfer to Verigy, liabilities that might arise under limited portions of Verigy's IPO materials that relate to Agilent, and costs and expenses incurred by Agilent or Verigy to effect the IPO, arising out of the distribution of Agilent's remaining holding in Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent's stockholders, or incurred to effect the separation of the semiconductor test solutions business from Agilent to the extent incurred prior to the separation on June1, 2006. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2006.
Indemnifications to Hewlett-Packard We have given multiple indemnities to Hewlett-Packard in connection with our activities prior to our spin-off from HP for the businesses that constituted Agilent prior to the spin-off. These indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, intellectual property and environmental matters. The agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on FormS-1 filed on August16, 1999. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnifications was not material as of October31, 2006.
Indemnifications to Officers and Directors Our corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the 102 claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these obligations was zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of October31, 2006.
Other Indemnifications As is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October31, 2006.
18.Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Commitments: We lease certain real and personal property from unrelated third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases related to continuing operations at October31, 2006 were $79million for 2007, $62million for 2008, $44million for 2009, $25million for 2010, $16million for 2011 and $37million thereafter. Future minimum sublease income under leases at October31, 2006 was $12million for 2007, $10million for 2008, $6million for 2009, $2million for 2010 and zero for 2011. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Total rent expense, including amounts recorded in discontinued operations, was $112million in 2006, $90million in 2005 and $116million in 2004. Rent expense recorded in discontinued operations was $2million in 2006, $23million in 2005 and $25million in 2004.
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including patent, commercial and environmental matters. There are no matters pending that we expect to be material in relation to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
19.Restructuring and Asset Impairment We initiated several restructuring plans in prior periods: the 2001 Plan, the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan ("Prior Plans"). The workforce reduction portion of the Prior Plans was completed during fiscal year 2005. The consolidation of excess facilities portion of Prior Plans is expected to be completed within approximately the next five years. In addition, there may be future changes in estimates for the consolidation of excess facilities related to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the time the charges were recorded.
103 In the fourth quarter of 2005, as a consequence of the decision to divest the semiconductor products and semiconductor test solutions businesses, we launched a new restructuring program (the "2005 Plan") to align our workforce with our smaller organizational size. The 2005 Plan consists purely of workforce reduction initiatives, and is primarily focused on reducing the costs associated with the shared services functions.
A summary of total restructuring activity, including that classified as discontinued operations, is shown in the table below: Workforce Reduction Consolidation of Excess Facilities Impairments Total (in millions) Balance as of October31, 2003 $ 18 $ 71 $  $ 89 Income statement expense 101 35 25 161 Asset impairments   (25 ) (25 ) Cash payments (98 ) (40 )  (138 ) Balance as of October31, 2004 $ 21 $ 66 $  $ 87 Income statement expense 106 10 7 123 Asset impairments   (7 ) (7 ) Cash payments (83 ) (27 )  (110 ) Balance as of October31, 2005 $ 44 $ 49 $  $ 93 Income statement expense 111 33 42 186 Asset impairments   (42 ) (42 ) Cash payments (142 ) (24 )  (166 ) Balance as of October31, 2006 $ 13 $ 58 $  $ 71 The restructuring accrual for all plans, which totaled $71million at October31, 2006 and $93million at October31, 2005, is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and represents estimated future cash outlays. Workforce reduction expenses, primarily severance, are expected to be largely completed by the end of fiscal 2007. In 2006, we consolidated several facilities due to changes in our organizational structure and recorded impairment charges of $42million. These charges were primarily associated with facilities located in Germany and the US.
104 A summary of the statement of operations impact of the charges resulting from all restructuring plans is shown below: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Cost of products and services $ 28 $ 35 $ 47 Research and development 21 19 10 Selling, general and administrative 123 54 77 Restructuring and asset impairment charges included in continuing operations 172 108 134 Restructuring and asset impairment charges included in discontinued operations, semiconductor products business  10 26 Restructuring and asset impairment charges included in discontinued operations, semiconductor test solutions business 14 5 1 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 186 $ 123 $ 161 20.Other Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities Other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities at October31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Other accrued liabilities Accrued expenses $ 51 $ 43 Restructuring 32 71 Standard warranty accruals 28 35 Other 20 9 Total other accrued liabilities $ 131 $ 158 Other long-term liabilities Deferred tax liabilities $ 182 $ 131 Deferred revenue and extended warranty 72 66 Deferred compensation 58 54 Minority interest 11 34 Restructuring 39 22 Standard warranty accruals 1 5 Other 32 29 Total other long-term liabilities $ 395 $ 341 105 Amounts owed to our employees for accrued vacation totaled $133million and $145million at October31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is recorded in employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheet.
21.Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities In January2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade,Inc., a consolidated wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent ("World Trade"), entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with a third party pursuant to which World Trade sold 15,000 ClassA preferred shares of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5billion. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the third party those preferred shares for 100percent of their aggregate liquidation preference in January2011. The $1.5billion obligation of our subsidiary to repurchase the preferred shares has been classified as long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The related debt issuance costs of $25million were deferred and recognized in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. These costs will be amortized over the life of the Repurchase Agreement.
Under the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the third party at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 28 basis points. Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the third party the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade. The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default but no financial covenants. Under the Repurchase Agreement, our subsidiary has the right to accelerate the repurchase of all or any portion of the preferred shares prior to January2011.
In connection with the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade's wholly owned subsidiary is required to hold short-term investments. As of October31, 2006, these investments were approximately $1,582million and were classified within restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note11, "Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents." In December2005, we drew down $700million on a $1billion senior secured term borrowing facility to help finance our share repurchase program. The term facility allowed us a one-time borrowing at an interest rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points per annum. In January2006, we applied $700million of the proceeds from the Repurchase Agreement to repay the full amount borrowed under the secured term borrowing facility. Total interest expense on the senior secured term borrowing facility was $3.6million. The senior secured term borrowing facility expired in the first quarter of 2006.
22.Stock Repurchase Program During the fourth quarter of 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $4.466billion of our common stock. Under the program, we repurchased 8.9million shares for $290million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
In the first quarter of 2006, under a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer, we agreed to accept for payment 83million shares at a purchase price of $36 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $3billion. In June2006, we completed our stock repurchase program which was announced in fourth quarter of 2005. Under the program, we repurchased a total of approximately 125million shares of our common stock for $4.466billion. In addition, we capitalized $3million of service and legal fees.
106 During the fourth quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors authorized another stock repurchase program of up to $2billion of our common stock. Under the new program, we repurchased approximately 1.7million shares for $56million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
As of October31, 2006, we have repurchased approximately 127million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.5billion. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method.
23.Segment Information Description of segments.
We are a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. During 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business. See Note3, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business" and Note4, "Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Test Solutions Business" for further information. Following this reorganization, Agilent has two businesses bio-analytical measurement and electronic measurement each of which comprises a reportable segment. The segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Other factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels, were also considered in determining our reportable segments.
A description of our two remaining reportable segments is as follows:  Bio-analytical measurement business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Our seven key product categories include microarrays, microfluidics, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, and related consumables, reagents and services;  Electronic measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems, monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications networks and services, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.
Segment revenue and profit.
The accounting policies used to derive reportable segment results are generally the same as those described in Note1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies".
A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically managed centrally in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include costs of centralized research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to 107 the segments, and the allocations are determined on a basis that we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. After its separation on June1, 2006, Agilent started billing our semiconductor test solutions business for their use of shared services under the transition services agreement. Corporate charges previously allocated to our semiconductor products business and semiconductor test systems business, but not classified within discontinued operations, were not reallocated to our other segments. These charges are presented below as a component of the reconciliation between the segments' income from operations and Agilent's income from continuing operations and are classified as unallocated semiconductor products business corporate charges and unallocated semiconductor test systems business corporate charges.
The following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. These results are not in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. For example, share-based compensation, restructuring, and other items are excluded from the segment measure of income (loss) from operations. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including adjusted income (loss) from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.
The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, amortization of goodwill, amortization and impairment of other intangibles and other items as noted in the reconciliation below.
Bio-analytical Measurement Electronic Measurement Total Segments Year ended October 31, 2006: Total net revenue $ 1,554 $ 3,419 $ 4,973 Income from operations $ 240 $ 479 $ 719 Depreciation expense $ 39 $ 102 $ 141 Year ended October 31, 2005: Total net revenue $ 1,421 $ 3,265 $ 4,686 Income from operations $ 197 $ 360 $ 557 Depreciation expense $ 37 $ 98 $ 135 Year ended October 31, 2004: Total net revenue $ 1,333 $ 3,225 $ 4,558 Income from operations $ 186 $ 279 $ 465 Depreciation expense $ 38 $ 107 $ 145 In 2005 and 2004, revenue classified as discontinued operations included an adjustment of $1million and $2million respectively that was previously allocated to our semiconductor test solution business. As a result, total reportable segment revenue was higher than Agilent net revenue by $1million and $2million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively.
108 The following table reconciles segment results to Agilent's total enterprise results from continuing operations before taxes: Years Ended October 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Total reportable segments' income from operations $ 719 $ 557 $ 465 Restructuring and asset impairment (172 ) (108 ) (134 ) Gain on sale of Palo Alto headquarters and San Jose site 121   Stock-based compensation (94 )   Amortization of intangibles (24 ) (13 ) (17 ) Retirement plans net curtailment and settlement 23   Other income (expense), net 163 75 24 Unallocated semiconductor products business corporate charges (14 ) (132 ) (123 ) Unallocated semiconductor test solutions business corporate charges (42 ) (64 ) (70 ) Unallocated corporate charges and other (53 ) (24 ) (58 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes, as reported $ 627 $ 291 $ 87 Major customers.
No customer represented 10percent or more of our total net revenue in 2006, 2005 or 2004.
Unallocated assets primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets and other assets. In 2006, we refined the methodology for allocating corporate assets, the largest component of which relates to deferred tax assets before the valuation adjustment. Also, in 2006, we disposed a portion of our equity investments and the remaining balance of $16million was reclassified to available for sale securities. The following table reflects the updated measure of segment assets, capital expenditures and investments in equity-method investees directly managed by each segment. All historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Bio-analytical Measurement Electronic Measurement Total Segments As of October 31, 2006: Assets $ 922 $ 2,156 $ 3,078 Capital expenditures $ 54 $ 131 $ 185 As of October 31, 2005: Assets $ 690 $ 2,009 $ 2,699 Capital expenditures $ 41 $ 68 $ 109 Investments in and advances to equity-method investees  $ 20 $ 20 109 The following table reconciles segment assets to Agilent's total assets: October 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Total reportable segments' assets $ 3,078 $ 2,699 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 2,262 2,251 Total assets of discontinued operations, semiconductor products business  842 Total assets of discontinued operations, semiconductor test solutions business  247 Prepaid expenses 284 227 Cost method investments 81 126 Restricted cash and cash equivalents 1,606 22 Long-term and other receivables 205 201 Other, including valuation allowance (147 ) 136 Total assets $ 7,369 $ 6,751 Geographic Information The following table presents summarized information for net revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region for continuing operations.
