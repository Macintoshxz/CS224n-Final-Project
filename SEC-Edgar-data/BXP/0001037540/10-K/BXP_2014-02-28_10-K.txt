We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, and one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States.
Our properties have been concentrated in five marketsBoston, New York, Princeton, San Francisco and Washington, DC. Beginning in fiscal 2014, Princeton will be reflected as the suburban component of the NewYork region. We conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiary, Boston Properties Limited Partnership. At December31, 2013, we owned or had interests in 175 properties, totaling approximately 44.4million net rentable square feet, including nine properties under construction totaling approximately 2.9million net rentable square feet.

The name Boston Properties and our logo (consisting of a stylized b) are registered service marks of Boston Properties Limited Partnership.
Boston Properties Limited Partnership Boston Properties Limited Partnership, or BPLP or our Operating Partnership, is a Delaware limited partnership, and the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. We are the sole general partner and, as of February21, 2014, the owner of approximately 89.5% of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by the Company as a percentage of the sum of (1)the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP, (2)the number of common partnership units issuable upon conversion of outstanding preferred partnership units of BPLP and (3)the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP, or LTIP Units, other than LTIP Units issued in the form of Outperformance Awards (OPP Awards) and Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards (MYLTIP Awards), assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of OPP Awards or MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10 th )of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned. Our general and limited partnership interests in BPLP entitle us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, BPLP in proportion to our percentage interest and entitle us to vote on all matters requiring a vote of the limited partners. The other limited partners of BPLP are persons who contributed their direct or indirect interests in properties to BPLP in exchange for common units or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP or recipients of LTIP Units pursuant to our Stock Option and Incentive Plan. Under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, unitholders may present their common units of BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of a unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of our common stock. In lieu of cash redemption by BPLP, however, we may elect to acquire any common units so tendered by issuing shares of our common stock in exchange for the common units. If we so elect, our common stock will be exchanged for common units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. We generally expect that we will elect to issue our common stock in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having BPLP pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, our percentage ownership in BPLP will increase. In addition, whenever we issue shares of our common stock other than to acquire common units of BPLP, we must contribute any net proceeds we receive to BPLP and BPLP must issue to us an equivalent number of common units of BPLP. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT.
Preferred units of BPLP have the rights, preferences and other privileges as are set forth in an amendment to the limited partnership agreement of BPLP. As of December31, 2013 and February21, 2014, BPLP had three series of Preferred Units outstanding consisting of 666,116 Series Two Preferred Units, 360,126 Series Four Preferred Units and 80,000 Series B Preferred Units. The Series Two Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit (or an aggregate of approximately $33.3million at December31, 2013 and February21, 2014). The Series Two Preferred Units are convertible, at the holders election, into common units at a conversion price of $38.10 per common unit (equivalent to a ratio of 1.312336 common units per Series Two Preferred Unit). Distributions on the Series Two Preferred Units are payable quarterly and, unless the greater rate described in the next sentence applies, accrue at 6.0%per annum. If distributions on the number of common units of limited partnership interest, or OP Units, into which the Series Two Preferred Units are convertible are greater than distributions calculated using the rate described in the preceding sentence for the applicable quarterly period, then the greater distributions are payable instead. The holders of Series Two Preferred Units have the right to require our Operating Partnership to redeem their units for cash at the redemption price of $50.00 per unit on May12, 2014. The holders also had the right to have their Series Two Preferred Units redeemed for cash as of May12, 2009, May12, 2010, May12, 2011,May14, 2012 and May14, 2013, although no holder exercised such 2 Table of Contents right. In May 2014, our Operating Partnership also has the right, subject to certain conditions, to call for redemption all of the outstanding Series Two Preferred Units for cash or to convert into OP Units any Series Two Preferred Units that have not been previously redeemed. In the event that our Operating Partnership calls the Series Two Preferred Units for redemption, the holders shall have the right to convert the Series Two Preferred Units to OP Units. Due to the holders redemption option existing outside our control, the Series Two Preferred Units are presented outside of permanent equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Series Four Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit (or an aggregate of approximately $18.0 million at December31, 2013 and February21, 2014). The Series Four Preferred Units, which bear a preferred distribution equal to 2.00%per annum on a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit, are not convertible into or exchangeable for any common equity of BPLP or us. In order to secure the performance of certain obligations by the holders, such Series Four Preferred Units are subject to forfeiture pursuant to the terms of a pledge agreement. The holders of Series Four Preferred Units have the right, at certain times and subject to certain conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designations establishing the rights, limitations and preferences of the Series Four Preferred Units, to require our Operating Partnership to redeem all of their units for cash at the redemption price of $50.00 per unit. Our Operating Partnership also has the right, at certain times and subject to certain conditions, to redeem all of the Series Four Preferred Units for cash at the redemption price of $50.00 per unit. The Series Four Preferred Units that are subject to the security interest under the pledge agreement may not be redeemed until and unless such security interest is released. Due to the holders redemption option existing outside our control, the Series Four Preferred Units are presented outside of permanent equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Series B Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $2,500.00 per share (or an aggregate of approximately $193.6 million at December31, 2013 and February21, 2014, after deducting the underwriting discount and transaction expenses). The Series B Preferred Units were issued by our Operating Partnership on March27, 2013 in connection with our issuance of 80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares each representing 1/100th of a share) of 5.25% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock). We contributed the net proceeds from the offering to our Operating Partnership in exchange for Series B Preferred Units having terms and preferences generally mirroring those of the Series B Preferred Stock. We will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at a rate of 5.25%per annum of the $2,500.00 liquidation preference per share. We may not redeem the Series B Preferred Stock prior to March27, 2018, except in certain circumstances relating to the preservation of our REIT status. On or after March27, 2018, at our option, we may redeem the Series B Preferred Stock for a cash redemption price of $2,500.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the holders, has no maturity date and is not convertible into any other security of the Company or its affiliates.
Transactions During 2013 Acquisitions On February6, 2013, we completed the acquisition of 535 Mission Street, a development site, in San Francisco, California for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $71.0 million in cash, including work completed and materials purchased to date. When completed, 535 Mission Street will consist of a 27-story, ClassA office tower with approximately 307,000 net rentable square feet of office and retail space. The property is currently under development.
On March26, 2013, a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 95% interest completed the acquisition of a land parcel in San Francisco, California that will support a 60-story, 1.4million square foot office tower known as Transbay Tower. The purchase price for the land was approximately $192.0 million. On February7, 2013, the partner in the joint venture issued a notice that it was electing under the joint venture agreement to reduce its nominal ownership interest in the venture from 50% to 5%. On February26, 2013, we issued a notice to the partner electing to proceed with the venture on that basis. As a result, we have a 95% nominal interest in 3 Table of Contents and are consolidating the joint venture. The initial phase of the development consisting of building the project to grade is currently under development.
On March29, 2013, we completed the acquisition of a parcel of land located in Reston, Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $27.0 million. The land parcel is commercially zoned for 250,000 square feet of office space.
On April10, 2013, we acquired the Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park properties from our Value-Added Fund (the Value-Added Fund) for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $233.1 million. Mountain View Research Park is a 16-building complex of Office/Technical properties aggregating approximately 604,000 net rentable square feet. Mountain View Technology Park is a seven-building complex of Office/Technical properties aggregating approximately 135,000 net rentable square feet. Prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the properties was approximately 39.5%. As a result of the acquisition, we own 100% of the properties and account for them on a consolidated basis.
On May31, 2013, our two joint venture partners in 767 Venture, LLC (the entity that owns 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) located in New York City) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) is a ClassA office property totaling approximately 1.8million net rentable square feet. In connection with the transfer, we and our new joint venture partners modified our relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. These changes resulted in us having sufficient financial and operating control over 767Venture, LLC such that, effective as of May31, 2013, we account for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 Venture, LLC on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting.
Dispositions On February20, 2013, the foreclosure sale of our Montvale Center property was ratified by the court. As a result of the ratification, the mortgage loan totaling $25.0 million was extinguished and the related obligations were satisfied with the transfer of the real estate resulting in the recognition of a gain on forgiveness of debt totaling approximately $20.2 million.
On June28, 2013, we completed the sale of our 303 Almaden Boulevard property located in San Jose, California for a sale price of $40.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $39.3 million. 303 Almaden Boulevard is a ClassA office property totaling approximately 158,000 net rentable square feet. Because we entered into the related purchase and sale agreement on March28, 2013 and the carrying value of the property exceeded its net sale price, we recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $3.2 million during the three months ended March31, 2013. As a result, there was no loss on sale of real estate recognized during the year ended December31, 2013. The sale of this asset caused us to reevaluate ourstrategy for developmentof our adjacent Almaden land parcel, which can accommodate an approximately 840,000 square feet office complex.Based on a shorter than expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of the land parcel to its estimated fair market value and recognized an impairment loss of approximately $8.3 million during the three months ended March31, 2013.
On August22, 2013, we completed the sale of our 1301 New York Avenue property located in Washington, DC for a net contract sale price of approximately $121.7 million. After adjusting for outstanding lease and other transaction costs assumed by the buyer, the gross sale price was approximately $135.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $121.5 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $86.4 million. 1301 New York Avenue is a ClassA office property totaling approximately 201,000 net rentable square feet.
On October9, 2013, we completed the sale of a 45% ownership interest in our Times Square Tower property for a gross sale price of $684.0 million in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $673.1 million, 4 Table of Contents after the payment of transaction costs. In connection with the sale, we formed a joint venture with the buyer and will provide customary property management and leasing services to the joint venture. Times Square Tower is an approximately 1,246,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office tower located in New York City. The transaction did not qualify as a sale of real estate for financial reporting purposes because we continue to control the joint venture and will therefore continue to account for the entity on a consolidated basis in our financial statements. We have accounted for the transaction as an equity transaction and have recognized noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets totaling approximately $243.5 million, which is equal to 45% of the carrying value of the total equity of the property immediately prior to the transaction. The difference between the net cash proceeds received and the noncontrolling interest recognized, which difference totals approximately $429.6million, has not been reflected as a gain on sale of real estate in our consolidated statements of operations and has instead been reflected as an increase to additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.
On December20, 2013, we completed the sale of our 10& 20 Burlington Mall Road property located in Burlington, Massachusetts for a sale price of approximately $30.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $29.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $20.5 million. 10& 20 Burlington Mall Road consists of two ClassA office properties aggregating approximately 152,000 net rentable square feet.
On December20, 2013, we completed the sale of our One Preserve Parkway property located in Rockville, Maryland for a sale price of approximately $61.3 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $59.9 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $5.9 million. One Preserve Parkway is a ClassA office property totaling approximately 184,000 net rentable square feet.
Developments As of December31, 2013, we had nine properties under construction comprised of eight office properties and one residential property, which aggregate approximately 2.9million square feet. We estimate the total investment to complete these projects, in the aggregate, is approximately $2.5 billion of which we had already invested approximately $1.8 billion as of December31, 2013.

The mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.96%per annum and was scheduled to mature on May5, 2013. There was no prepayment penalty.

On May31, 2013, in conjunction with the consolidation of our 767 Venture, LLC joint venture (the entity that owns 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building)), we recorded mortgage loans collateralized by the property aggregating $1.3 billion and mezzanine loans aggregating $306.0 million. The mortgage loans require interest-only payments at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 5.95%per annum and mature on October7, 2017. The mezzanine loans require interest-only payments at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 6.02%per annum and mature on October7, 2017. The mortgage loans and mezzanine loans were recorded at their fair values aggregating approximately $1.5 billion and $311.7 million, respectively, using weighted-average effective interest rates of approximately 2.44% and 5.53%per annum, respectively. In addition, in conjunction with the consolidation, we recorded loans payable to the joint ventures partners totaling $450.0 million and related accrued interest payable totaling approximately $175.8 million. The member loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 11.0%per annum and mature on June9, 2017.

In addition, the agreement provides that if Mr.Zuckerman terminates his employment with us for any reason, voluntarily or involuntarily, he will become fully vested in any outstanding equity awards with time-based vesting. As a result, during the year ended December31, 2013, we accelerated the remaining approximately $12.9 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with Mr.Zuckermans unvested long-term equity awards.

Business and Growth Strategies Business Strategies Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment so as to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return in all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to achieve this objective are:  to target a few carefully selected geographic markets, including Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC, and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, owners, developers and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise. We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective tenants in various industries and where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities;  to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the lack of available sites and the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office, research and development space, as well as selected retail and residential space;  to take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;  to own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of todays tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services and amenities, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients; 11 Table of Contents  to opportunistically acquire assets which increase our penetration in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve or preserve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing;  to explore joint venture opportunities primarily with existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital, and/or to explore joint venture opportunities with strategic institutional partners, leveraging our skills as owners, operators and developers of ClassA office space and mixed-use complexes;  to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1)take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2)pare from our portfolio of properties that we believe have slower future growth potential;  to seek third-party development contracts, which can be a significant source of revenue and enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and  to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations.
Growth Strategies External Growth Strategies We believe that our development experience and our organizational depth position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including residential), low-rise suburban office properties and research and laboratory space, within budget and on schedule. We believe we are also well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:  our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that could support approximately 12.4million additional square feet of new office, retail, and residential development;  our reputation gained through 44 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;  our relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions seeking new facilities and development services;  our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry;  our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas;  our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; and  our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets.
Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories:  Development in selected submarkets.
We believe the additional development of well-positioned office buildings and mixed use complexes could be justified in many of our submarkets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely 12 Table of Contents concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 44-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential.
In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment.
Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.
Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals.
We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions. There may be enhanced opportunities to purchase assets with near-term financing maturities or possibly provide debt on assets at enhanced yields given the limited availability of traditional sources of debt. Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. We may also acquire properties for cash, but we are also particularly well-positioned to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets or our common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax-efficient basis. In addition, we may consider mergers with and acquisitions of compatible real estate firms.
Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets . We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program. We have developed this strategy and program for our existing portfolio, where we provide high-quality property management services using our own employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties. We are able to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house and third-party vendors services for marketing, including calls and presentations to prospective tenants, print advertisements, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements. Our tenants benefit from cost efficiencies produced by our experienced work force, which is attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management.
Internal Growth Strategies We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties because they are of high quality and in desirable locations within markets where, in general, the creation of new supply is limited 13 Table of Contents by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary approvals for development on vacant land and financing. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1)to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2)to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements and (3)to work with new or existing tenants with space expansion or contraction needs maximizing the cash flow from our assets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:  Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit tenants.
In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.
The average lease term of our in-place leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 6.6 years at December31, 2013 and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable tenants. Based on leases in place at December31, 2013, leases with respect to approximately 6.2% of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2014.
Directly manage properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention.
We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations.
Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs . We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and achieve relatively high rental rates as a result of our well-located, well- designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets.
Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration . We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy tenants on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships.
Policies with Respect to Certain Activities The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by our Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by our Board of Directors.
Investment Policies Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in the value of Boston Properties, Inc. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.
We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development projects and other acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing 14 Table of Contents markets of Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC, but also potentially in new markets. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants.
We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership, including third parties with expertise in mixed-use opportunities. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio.
Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).
Investments in Real Estate Mortgages While our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment. We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership.
Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for our REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
Dispositions Our decision to dispose or partially dispose of properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors that such action would be in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP, including Mortimer B. Zuckerman, could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to us. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section1031 of the Internal Revenue Code or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale. Some of our assets are subject to tax protection agreements, which may limit our ability to dispose of the assets or require us to pay damages to the prior owners in the event of a taxable sale.
15 Table of Contents Financing Policies The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. However, our mortgages, credit facilities and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. We have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole.
Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and BPLP as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service.
Policies with Respect to Other Activities As the sole general partner of BPLP, we have the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. We have in the past, and may in the future, issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BPLP and we do not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Treasury Regulations), our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Sustainability As one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States, we actively work to promote our growth and operations in a sustainable and responsible manner across our four regions. We focus our sustainability initiatives on the design and construction of our new developments, the operation of our existing buildings and our internal corporate practices. Our sustainability initiatives are centered on energy efficiency, waste reduction and water preservation, as well as making a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business. Through these efforts we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment while mutually benefiting our tenants, investors, employees and the communities in which we operate. We provide disclosure on our website to increase the transparency of our sustainability program, which we periodically update with current or additional information. You may access our sustainability report on our website at http://www.bostonproperties.com under the heading Sustainability.
Competition We compete in the leasing of office, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc.
16 Table of Contents Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
In addition, although not part of our core strategy, we are currently developing one residential property and operate two residential properties and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties.As an owner and operator of apartments, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because we have limited experience with residential properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties.
Our Hotel Property We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease allows economic benefits of ownership to flow to us. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary. In connection with these arrangements, Marriott has agreed to operate and maintain our hotel in accordance with its system-wide standard for comparable hotels and to provide the hotel with the benefits of its central reservation system and other chain-wide programs and services. Under a management agreement for the hotel, Marriott acts as the taxable REIT subsidiarys agent to supervise, direct and control the management and operation of the hotel and receives as compensation base management fees that are calculated as a percentage of the hotels gross revenues, and supplemental incentive fees if the hotel exceeds negotiated profitability breakpoints. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary compensates Marriott, on the basis of a formula applied to the hotels gross revenues, for certain system-wide services provided by Marriott, including central reservations, marketing and training. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, Marriott received an aggregate of approximately $1.2 million, $2.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, from our taxable REIT subsidiary.
Seasonality Our hotel property traditionally has experienced significant seasonality in its operating income, with the percentage of net operating income by quarter over the year ended December31, 2013 shown below.

18 Table of Contents Item1A.
Risk Factors.
Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. We refer to the shares of our common stock and the units of limited partnership interest in BPLP together as our securities, and the investors who own shares or units, or both, as our securityholders. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 51.
Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:  downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);  competition from other office, hotel, retail and residential buildings;  local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, hotel, retail or residential space;  changes in interest rates and availability of financing;  vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;  changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business culture;  increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;  civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;  significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;  declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and  decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.
We are dependent upon the economic climates of our marketsBoston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC.
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in four markets: Boston, New York, SanFrancisco and Washington, DC. A downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space. Because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. For example, in our Washington, DC market we focus on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as legal firms. A reduction in spending by the federal government could result in reduced demand for office space and adversely effect our results of operations. In addition, in our New York market we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. A significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations.
19 Table of Contents In addition, a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset (1)is not recoverable over its expected holding period and (2)exceeds its fair value. There can be no assurance that we will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets or investments. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.
Our investment in property development may be more costly than anticipated.
We intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office and residential properties. Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:  we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;  we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;  we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;  we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;  we may expend funds on and devote managements time to projects which we do not complete;  we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule; and  we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted.
Investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated.
Our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:  we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development;  operating expenses may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected; and  occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.
We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.
We operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as mixed-use developments. This means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for residential, retail, hotel or other commercial purposes. We have limited experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate. As a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. If we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to 20 Table of Contents develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate.In addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). In the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because we have limited experience with residential properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties.If we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us.
We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.
We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. In addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity.There is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. This risk is currently heightened because of tightened underwriting standards. These conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future.
We have agreements with a number of limited partners of BPLP who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.
Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you.
Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole, by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the continuing impact of high unemployment, and by international economic conditions. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:  the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, may be adversely affected, which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;  significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 21 Table of Contents  our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;  reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans;  the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors;  one or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all; and  to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments.
An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all.
As of February21, 2014, we had no outstanding indebtedness, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, that bears interest at variable rates, but we may incur such indebtedness in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. While these agreementsare intended tolessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk thatthe other parties to the agreements will not perform,wecould incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceableand theunderlying transactionswill fail toqualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.
The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. In addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.
22 Table of Contents We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our existing portfolio, our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. In addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock or debt securities.
On February21, 2014, our total consolidated debt was approximately $10.6 billion (i.e., excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt). Consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total consolidated market capitalization was approximately $30.0 million at February21, 2014. Total consolidated market capitalization was calculated using the closing stock price of $112.10 per common share and the following: (1)153,006,302 shares of our common stock, (2)15,582,151 outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership (excluding common units held by us), (3)an aggregate of 874,168 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Series Two Preferred Units of partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership, (4)an aggregate of 1,571,467 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, (5)360,126 Series Four Preferred Units of partnership interest multiplied by the fixed liquidation preference of $50 per unit, (6)80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share), of our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, at a price of $2,500 per share ($25 per depositary share) and (7)our consolidated debt totaling approximately $10.6 billion. The calculation of total consolidated market capitalization does not include 396,150 2012 OPP Units, 316,325 2013 MYLTIP Units and 485,459 2014 MYLTIP Units because, unlike other LTIP Units, they are not earned until certain return thresholds are achieved. Our total consolidated debt, which excludes debt collateralized by our unconsolidated joint ventures, at February21, 2014 represented approximately 35.31% of our total consolidated market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of our stock price, or our ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.
23 Table of Contents We face risks associated with property acquisitions.
We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:  even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;  we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;  acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;  the actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;  the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied;  acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;  we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity; and  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt.Investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that we satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to REITs.If we fail to structure any such acquisition properly, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.In addition, acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrowers default, including potential bankruptcy, and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments.There can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy.
We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. This acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
Any future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business.
We have underwritten, and in the future may acquire, properties, portfolios of properties or interests in real-estate related entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us. If we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets, we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with 24 Table of Contents local laws and government and permitting procedures. In addition, our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income, restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over terrorist activities. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-U.S.entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise.
Investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations.
We may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest.
If we invest in countries where the U.S.dollar is not the national currency, we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by hedging exchange rate fluctuations; however, access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk. We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks.
Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.
We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:  liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;  claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and  claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.
We plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:  we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private REITs, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and  even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.
25 Table of Contents Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
In appropriate circumstances, we intend to develop, acquire and recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. We currently have joint ventures that are and are not consolidated within our financial statements. Our share of the aggregate revenue from all of our joint ventures represented approximately 14.9% of our total revenue (the sum of our total consolidated revenue and our share of such joint venture revenue) for the year ended December31, 2013. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:  we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property and could lead to the sale of either parties ownership interest or the property;  some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and in the current credit markets the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls;  our joint venture partners may default on their obligations necessitating that we fulfill their obligation ourselves;  our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties;  our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest;  our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest; and  our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them.
Our properties face significant competition.
We face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office and residential properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our tenants. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties.
We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.
We derive most of our income from rent received from our tenants. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.
We face potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. Our tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.
26 Table of Contents We may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.
Properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. This may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes. Properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases. Furthermore, as a REIT, we may be subject to a 100% prohibited transactions tax on the gain from dispositions of property if we are deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifiesunder a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held forat leasttwo years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met.The potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable REIT subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred. If we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs, which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage. In some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors. To dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants).
Because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.
The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property:  our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;  if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;  our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and  our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism.
In addition, because our hotel property is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is subject to the Cambridge markets fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.
We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
We continue to have significant cash balances that we invest in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):  direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;  obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies; 27 Table of Contents  taxable municipal securities;  obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;  commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;  repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;  both registered and unregistered money market funds; and  other highly rated short-term securities.
Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply. We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
In addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as REITs and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT then, unless certain relief provisions apply, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:  we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and  unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.
In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT and the relief provisions do not apply, we will no longer be required to pay dividends. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to raise capital and expand our business, and it would adversely affect the value of our common stock. If we fail 28 Table of Contents to qualify as a REIT but are eligible for certain relief provisions, then we may retain our status as a REIT but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial.
In order to maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
In order to maintain our REIT status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding capital gains. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. The inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our REIT status.
Limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.
Provisions in our Charter and bylaws, our shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Delaware corporate law, may:  delay or prevent a change of control over us or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to our stockholders; and  limit our stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.
Stock Ownership Limit To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a REIT and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership, our Charter generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our common stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Our Board of Directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, under our Charter each of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity common stock. Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.
BPLPs Partnership Agreement We have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of BPLP other than us receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1)the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of our common stock in the transaction or (2)limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of our common stock received in the transaction. If these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners 29 Table of Contents holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by Boston Properties, Inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. In addition, we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that we will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which we receive the approval of our common stockholders unless (1)limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by Boston Properties, Inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2)the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction. Therefore, if our common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before we can complete the transaction:  holders of partnership interests in BPLP, including Boston Properties, Inc., must vote on the matter;  Boston Properties, Inc. must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as our stockholders voted on the transaction; and  the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.
As a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and we may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though our stockholders approve of the transaction.
Shareholder Rights Plan We have a shareholder rights plan. Under the terms of this plan, we can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock because, unless we approve of the acquisition, after the person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. This would substantially reduce the value and influence of the stock owned by the acquiring person. Our Board of Directors can prevent the plan from operating by approving the transaction in advance, which gives us significant power to approve or disapprove of the efforts of a person or group to acquire a large interest in our company.
Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following:  the extent of investor interest in our securities;  the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;  our underlying asset value;  investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;  national economic conditions;  changes in tax laws;  our financial performance;  changes in our credit ratings; and  general stock and bond market conditions.
The market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, our common stock may 30 Table of Contents trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock. If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish.
Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.
The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions, or repay indebtedness. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.
The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.
In connection with and subsequent to our initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of Boston Properties, Inc. or partnership interests in BPLP were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. This common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. Additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. Future sales of our common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of our common stock.
We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.
Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies.
Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
We depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Executive Chairman, Owen D. Thomas, our Chief Executive Officer, Douglas T. Linde, our President, and Raymond A. Ritchey, Executive Vice President, National Director of Acquisitions and Development. Among the reasons that Messrs. Zuckerman, Thomas, Linde and Ritchey are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, joint venture partners and other investors. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential tenants and industry personnel could diminish. Mr.Zuckerman has substantial outside business interests that could interfere with his ability to devote his full time to our business and affairs.
Our Chief Financial Officer and Regional Managers also have strong reputations. Their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective tenants and industry personnel.
Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP.
Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in BPLP than on our stockholders.
Some holders of interests in BPLP, including Mr.Zuckerman, could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences 31 Table of Contents to us and our stockholders. Consequently, these holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While we have exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of our Board of Directors. While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters, as directors and executive officers, Messrs. Zuckerman and D. Linde could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of our stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.
Agreement not to sell some properties.
We have entered into agreements with respect to some properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. Pursuant to those agreements, we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer some of our properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income and we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. In general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered. As of December31, 2013, there were a total of three properties subject to these restrictions. In the aggregate, all properties subject to the restrictions accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue (the sum of our total consolidated revenue and our share of joint venture revenue) for the year ended December31, 2013.
BPLP has also entered into agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. These agreements may hinder actions that we may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because we would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if we violate these agreements.
Mr.Zuckerman will continue to engage in other activities.
Mr.Zuckerman has a broad and varied range of investment interests. He could acquire an interest in a company which is not currently involved in real estate investment activities but which may acquire real property in the future. However, pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr.Zuckerman will not, in general, have management control over such companies and, therefore, he may not be able to prevent one or more of such companies from engaging in activities that are in competition with our activities.
Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.
The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including office buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.
Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.
32 Table of Contents Failure to comply with Federal government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue.
We are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a Federal government contractor.These laws regulate how we conduct business, require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors. Our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines, penalties and damages, cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the Federal government and bar us from entering into future leases and other contracts with the Federal government. There can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
We carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September11, 2001, the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA) was enacted in November 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). The expiration date of TRIA was extended to December31, 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA) and we can provide no assurance that it will be extended further. Currently, the per occurrence limits of our portfolio property insurance program are $1.0 billion, including coverage for acts of terrorism certified under TRIA other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism (Terrorism Coverage). We also carry $250 million of Terrorism Coverage for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York (601 Lexington Avenue) in excess of the $1.0 billion of Terrorism Coverage in our property insurance program which is provided by IXP, LLC (IXP) as a direct insurer. Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York (767 Fifth Avenue), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are $1.625 billion, including Terrorism Coverage, with $1.375 billion of Terrorism Coverage in excess of $250 million being provided by NYXP, LLC, (NYXP) as a direct insurer. We also currently carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under TRIA (NBCR Coverage), which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $1 billion. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the additional Terrorism Coverage provided by IXP for 601 Lexington Avenue, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP and the Terrorism Coverage provided by NYXP are backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is $100 million and the coinsurance is 15%. Under TRIPRA, if the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIPRA. We may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. In the event TRIPRA is not extended beyond December31, 2014, (i)we will evaluate alternative approaches to secure coverage for acts of terrorism thereby potentially increasing our overall cost of insurance, (ii)if such insurance is not available at commercially reasonable rates with limits equal to our current coverage or at all, we may not continue to have full occurrence limit coverage for acts of terrorism, (iii)we may not satisfy the insurance requirements under existing or future debt financings secured by individual properties, (iv)we may not be able to obtain future debt financings secured by individual properties and (v)we may cancel the insurance policies issued by IXP for the NBCR Coverage and the additional Terrorism Coverage for 601 Lexington Avenue and by NYXP for the Terrorism Coverage for 767Fifth Avenue. We intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain terrorism insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.
We also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that we believe are commercially reasonable. In addition, 33 Table of Contents this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our San Francisco region (excluding 535 Mission Street and the below grade improvements for Transbay Tower) with a $120 million per occurrence limit and a $120million annual aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer. The builders risk policy maintained for the development of 535 Mission Street in San Francisco includes a $15 million per occurrence and annual aggregate limit of earthquake coverage. In addition, the builders risk policy maintained for the development of the below grade improvements of the Transbay Tower in San Francisco includes a $15million per occurrence and annual aggregate limit of earthquake coverage. The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. We may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.
IXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco properties, the additional Terrorism Coverage for 601 Lexington Avenue and our NBCR Coverage. The additional Terrorism Coverage provided by IXP for 601 Lexington Avenue only applies to losses which exceed the program trigger under TRIA. NYXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our Terrorism Coverage for 767 Fifth Avenue. Currently, NYXP only insures losses which exceed the program trigger under TRIA and NYXP reinsures with a third-party insurance company any coinsurance payable under TRIA. Insofar as we own IXP and NYXP, we are responsible for their liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP and NYXP are part of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP and NYXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and their insurance policies are maintained after the payout by the Federal Government. If we experience a loss and IXP or NYXP are required to pay under their insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP and NYXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. In addition, our Operating Partnership has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of $20.0 million.
The mortgages on our properties typically contain requirements concerning the financial ratings of the insurers who provide policies covering the property. We provide the lenders on a regular basis with the identity of the insurance companies in our insurance programs. The ratings of some of our insurers are below the rating requirements in some of our loan agreements and the lenders for these loans could attempt to claim an event of default has occurred under the loan. We believe we could obtain insurance with insurers which satisfy the rating requirements. Additionally, in the future our ability to obtain debt financing secured by individual properties, or the terms of such financing, may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist on ratings for insurers or amounts of insurance which are difficult to obtain or which result in a commercially unreasonable premium. There can be no assurance that a deficiency in the financial ratings of one or more of our insurers will not have a material adverse effect on us.
We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and California earthquake risk in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.
34 Table of Contents Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.
We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. As a result, some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. See also Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
We face risks associated with our tenants and contractual counterparties being designated Prohibited Persons by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (OFAC) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (Prohibited Persons). OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons (the OFAC Requirements). Certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with OFAC Requirements. We have established a compliance program whereby tenants and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the OFAC list of Prohibited Persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. Our leases and other agreements, in general, require the other party to comply with OFAC Requirements. If a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the OFAC list we may be required by the OFAC Requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful.
We face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.
We cannot assert with certainty whether climate change is occurring and, if so, at what rate. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. For example, many of our properties are located along the East and West coasts, particularly those in the Central Business Districts of Boston, New York, and San Francisco. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or our inability to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy and increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.
Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because: as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination; even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each 35 Table of Contents person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.
These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a $20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $40 million. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination. Changes in laws, regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures.
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials. For example, laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:  properly manage and maintain the asbestos;  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and  undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.
Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
Some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and, for soil and/or groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem. Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that:  the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities;  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and  future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.
Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological 36 Table of Contents contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may be subject to third-party claims for personal injury, or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. Such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the propertys tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property.
We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems.
We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could:  disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants;  result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines and/or missed permitting deadlines;  result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;  result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;  result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;  require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;  subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements;or  damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally.
Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
37 Table of Contents We did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during our initial public offering.
We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of our initial public offering in June 1997. Before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. We did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. To the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties. Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of our initial public offering, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. We have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after our initial public offering, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.
Because of the ownership structure of our hotel property, we face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.
We own one hotel property. However, under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease our hotel property to one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. As lessor, we are entitled to a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the hotel property. Marriott International, Inc. manages the hotel under the Marriott name pursuant to a management contract with the taxable REIT subsidiary as lessee. While the taxable REIT subsidiary structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and state level. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to taxable REIT subsidiaries are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning our hotel property, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from our hotel. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the taxable REIT subsidiary and, therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from our hotel property.
We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.
From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.
We face possible state and local tax audits.
Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
38 Table of Contents Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our tenants.
Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Proposed changes include, but are not limited to, changes in lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of fair-value measures.
These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. Similarly, these changes could have a material impact on our tenants reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our tenants preferences regarding leasing real estate.

(computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 89.99%, 89.48%, 88.57%, 87.25% and 86.57% for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively,after allocation tothe noncontrolling interests.
FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
A reconciliation of FFO to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. computed in accordance with GAAP is provided under the heading of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFunds from Operations.

Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions. Such statements are contained principally, but not only, under the captions Business  Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any such forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result, should, will and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:  the continuing impacts of high unemployment and other macroeconomic trends, which are having and may continue to have a negative effect on the following, among other things:  the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy, tenant space utilization, and rental rates;  the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short-term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; and  the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis;  general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, tenant space utilization, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);  failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully;  the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations;  risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); 51 Table of Contents  risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the impact of higher interest rates on the cost and/or availability of financing;  risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;  risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;  risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;  costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws;  potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;  risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;  possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;  the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;  risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and  risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item1ARisk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and Current Reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Current Reports on Form 8-K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.
Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of ClassA office properties in the United States. Our properties have been concentrated in five marketsBoston, New York, Princeton, San Francisco and Washington, DC. Beginning in fiscal 2014, Princeton will be reflected as the suburban component of the New York region. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing ClassA office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. From time to time, we also generate cash through the sale of assets.
Our core strategy has always been to own, operate and develop properties in supply-constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve.To be successful in the current leasing environment, we believe all aspects of the tenant-landlord relationship must be considered. In this regard, we believe that our understanding of tenants short- and 52 Table of Contents long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets in which we operate, our relationships with local brokers, our reputation as a premier owner and operator of ClassA office properties, our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage. We expect tenants in our markets to continue to take advantage of the ability to upgrade to high-quality space in ClassA properties like ours, particularly those tenants who value our operational expertise and financial stability when making their leasing decisions.
Leasing activity has continued to improve in our submarkets in which demand is driven primarily by growth in the technology and life sciences industries. This is particularly true in the San Francisco Central Business District (CBD), Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Massachusetts and suburban Boston submarkets, and we remain optimistic about the long-term operating fundamentals in all of our markets. Our portfolio is concentrated in markets and submarkets where businesses are oriented on new ideas, such as technology, advertising, media and information distribution (often referred to as TAMI), mobility, life sciences and medical devices, and these segments of the economy are expanding and leasing additional office space. However, there continue to be headwinds against more rapid improvements in the overall office business. The strongest force is densification, which occurs as businesses seek less traditional layouts that cater to more collaborative work environments and fit people more efficiently into less space. We are also seeing moderate levels of new construction in our markets accommodating both growing tenant sectors and tenants seeking more efficient space utilization, and the resulting increase in supply presents challenges for increasing our occupancy and the rents we can realize.
Leasing activity in our portfolio during 2013 was consistent with recent years as we signed approximately 5.1million square feet of leases covering vacant space, extensions and expansions and pre-leasing for our development projects. This total was in line with our annual average of approximately 5.1million square feet over the past five years. Our activity has resulted in significant improvement in our portfolio occupancy of 200basis points in 2013 from 91.4% at December31, 2012 to 93.4% at December31, 2013.
In the midtown Manhattan market, overall leasing activity in 2013 remained strong for tenants seeking between 5,000 and 25,000 square feet, and we completed approximately 600,000 square feet of leasing in 58lease transactions.Activity in our portfolio has improved with same store occupancy increasing by 330 basis points from the end of 2012 to approximately 96.6% as of December31, 2013, with little near-term lease expirations.The increase in demand in our portfolio is driven by smaller tenants, primarily in the financial services industry.We also experienced activity from larger tenants and during 2013 we signed a 96,000 square foot lease with an established financial tenant at our 250 West 55th Street development project with projected revenue beginning in early 2015. As of December31, 2013, 250 West 55th Street has been partially placed in-service and is currently 61% leased.We expect to commence revenue recognition on a significant portion of the signed leases in the second half of 2014. We are also negotiating leases with four tenants totaling approximately 175,000 square feet and, if these leases are signed, the building will be approximately 76% leased.We do not expect these leases under negotiation, if signed, to begin revenue recognition until early 2015. At 510 Madison Avenue and 540 Madison Avenue our space leased has improved to 80% and 85%, respectively, with approximately 159,000 square feet of new leases signed during 2013 in 25 separate transactions.
In our Washington, DC region, the overall leasing activity continues to be slow and public sector and defense contractor demand has been adversely impacted by continued federal budgetary uncertainty, sequestration and the reductions in discretionary spending programs. Our near-term exposure in the Washington, DC CBD is limited due to our strong occupancy rate of 94.6%. In addition, with positive absorption in our suburban Washington, DC assets, particularly in Reston, Virginia, occupancy in our Washington region portfolio improved from approximately 94.3% at the end of 2012 to approximately 95.0% at December31, 2013, with moderate rollover/exposure through 2014 of approximately 7.8%. We are actively engaging our law firm tenants with future lease expirations to provide new space configuration in exchange for extended lease terms at market rents. This may result in us reducing the amount of space the tenant leases, therefore reducing near-term revenue, but providing for more stable long-term revenues.
53 Table of Contents In the Boston region, the expansion of the life sciences and technology industry is positively impacting each of the submarkets in which we operate. Our assets in the Boston CBD are approximately 98.0% leased. We have been actively leasing space to cover our 2014-2015 lease expirations at the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center and have signed approximately 817,000 square feet of new leases, early renewals and relocations. However, the positive rental impact from approximately 568,000 square feet will not be realized until 2015 because (1)a portion of these leases are with existing sublease tenants and therefore higher rents will not commence until the new direct lease takes effect and (2)other tenants do not take occupancy until 2015. The East Cambridge submarket is the strongest submarket in the region. Our Cambridge portfolio is 100% leased with approximately 77,000 square feet expiring through 2014. Although we have no vacant space to lease, we are negotiating early renewals with tenants in Cambridge that we expect will increase our rental revenues from these spaces in future years. In the suburbs of Boston along the Route 128 corridor, we are also benefiting from the strong tenant demand in the technology and life sciences industries with the completion of approximately 803,000 square feet of leases since the end of 2012. Specifically, at our Bay Colony Corporate Center we have signed leases or have leases under negotiation that, if consummated, would increase our occupancy from approximately 76.4%, as of December31, 2013, to approximately 89.5%. In total, our suburban portfolio occupancy improved 790 basis points since the beginning of 2013 to 86.3%.
The San Francisco CBD and Silicon Valley submarkets continue to benefit from business expansion and job growth, particularly in the technology sector, which has resulted in positive absorption, lower vacancy and increasing rental rates. Our assets in San Francisco CBD and the Silicon Valley submarkets are approximately 89.9% leased. During 2013 we leased approximately 1.1million square feet, including an approximately 428,000square foot renewal at our Gateway complex and an approximately 56,000 square foot lease at 50 Hawthorne Street. Our 680 Folsom Street/50 Hawthorne Street development project is now approximately 96% pre-leased with delivery expected in mid 2014. Construction of 535 Mission Street is on schedule and we expect to be able to deliver space to tenants in the second half of 2014 with revenue commencing in 2015. In addition, we have commenced the construction of below grade and foundation work for the Transbay Tower, a 1.4million square foot project located in the heart of San Franciscos South Financial submarket. These activities will be completed in early 2015 and, prior to completing these activities, we expect to determine whether to proceed to complete vertical construction.
At Carnegie Center in Princeton, New Jersey, we continue to gain occupancy, extend leases and expand our portfolio with build-to-suit opportunities. During 2013, we completed approximately 541,000 square feet of leases with existing, new or expanding tenants that will improve our occupancy from approximately 84.5%, as of December31, 2012, to a projected average of approximately 90% in 2014. In addition, we signed a 15-year lease with NRG Energy, Inc. for an approximately 130,000 net rentable square foot build-to-suit that we expect to deliver in 2016.
54 Table of Contents The table below details the leasing activity during the three and twelve months ended December31, 2013: ThreeMonths Ended December31,2013 TwelveMonths Ended December31,2013 Total Square Feet Vacant space available at the beginning of the period 2,973,975 3,501,253 Property dispositions/properties taken out of service (30,077 ) (139,354 ) Properties acquired vacant space  86,661 Properties placed in-service 4,100 616,783 Leases expiring or terminated during the period 547,336 2,877,334 Total space available for lease 3,495,334 6,942,677 1 st generation leases 68,450 648,942 2 nd generation leases with new tenants 548,660 2,398,202 2 nd generation lease renewals 194,577 1,211,886 Total space leased 811,687 4,259,030 Vacant space available for lease at the end of the period 2,683,647 2,683,647 Second generation leasing information : (1) Leases commencing during the period, in square feet 743,237 3,610,088 Average Lease Term 76 Months 81 Months Average Free Rent Period 79 Days 76 Days Total Transaction Costs Per Square Foot (2) $ 37.85 $ 36.58 Increase / (decrease) in Gross Rents (3) 1.30 % (1.08 )% Increase / (decrease) in Net Rents (4) 2.11 % (2.29 )% (1) Second generation leases are defined as leases for space that had previously been under lease by us.

(4) Represents the increase/(decrease) in net rent (gross rent less operating expenses) on the new vs. expired leases on the 407,680 and 2,462,953 square feet of second generation leases (1)that had been occupied within the prior 12 months and (2)for which the new lease term is greater than six months, for the three and twelve months ended December31, 2013, respectively.
From January1, 2014 to December31, 2014, leases representing approximately 6.2% of the space at our properties expire. As these leases expire, assuming no change in current market rental rates, we expect that the rental rates we are likely to achieve on new leases will generally be greater than the rates that are currently being paid.
Although we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets, the abundance of capital and demand for assets has resulted in increasing prices. As a result, in the current environment we are able to develop properties at a cost per square foot that is generally less than the cost at which we can acquire older existing properties, thereby generating relatively better returns with lower annual maintenance expenses and capital costs. Accordingly, we believe the successful lease-up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long-term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in-service through 2016.
55 Table of Contents During the twelve months ended December31, 2013, we fully placed in-service Two Patriots Park in Reston, Virginia, 500 North Capitol Street in Washington, DC, Annapolis Junction Building Six in Annapolis, Maryland, Seventeen Cambridge Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Cambridge Center Connector in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition, during 2013, we partially placed in-service 250 West 55th Street in New York City, 680 Folsom Street in San Francisco and The Avant, our residential project in Reston, Virginia. We believe the development of well-positioned office buildings is justified in many of our submarkets where tenants have shown demand for high-quality construction, modern design, efficient floor plates and sustainable features. In addition, select first-class residential developments that are part of a mixed-use environment, which combine office, retail and residential uses, have proven successful in our markets. Each of our development projects underway is pre-certified USGB LEED Silver or higher. As of December31, 2013, our current development pipeline, which excludes properties which are fully placed in-service, totals approximately 2.9million square feet with a total projected investment of approximately $2.5 billion. Additionally, we are working on several new developments in each of our markets that could commence in 2015 or later.
Given investor demand for assets like ours we also continue to review our portfolio to identify properties that may have limited opportunities for cash flow growth, no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or can attract premium pricing in the current market environment as potential sales candidates. During 2013 we sold approximately $1.25 billion (our share) of assets, including:  a 45% ownership interest in our Times Square Tower property in New York City for a gross sale price of approximately $684 million,  125 West 55th Street in New York City, which was owned by a joint venture in which we had a 60%interest, for approximately $470 million, of which our share is approximately $282.0 million,  an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street in New York City, which were owned by a joint venture in which we had a 50% interest, for an imputed sale price of approximately $45 million, of which our share is approximately $22.5 million,  303 Almaden Boulevard in San Jose, California for approximately $40 million,  1301 New York Avenue in Washington, DC for approximately $135 million,  10& 20 Burlington Mall Road in Burlington, Massachusetts for approximately $30 million, and  One Preserve Parkway in Rockville, Maryland for approximately $61 million.
In general, we structure asset sales for possible inclusion in like kind exchanges within the meaning of Section1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ability to complete a like kind exchange depends on many factors, including, among others, identifying and acquiring suitable replacement property within limited time periods and the ownership structure of the property being sold, and therefore we are not always able to sell an asset as part of a like kind exchange. When successful, however, like kind exchanges enable us to defer the taxable gain on the asset sold and thus preserve capital. Primarily as a result of our 2013 asset sales program, we declared a special dividend of $2.25 per share of common stock to holders of record as of December31, 2013 that was paid on January29, 2014. We are considering the sale of all or a portion of additional properties and if we are unable to identify and acquire suitable replacement property in a like kind exchange, then we expect to distribute at least the amount of proceeds necessary to avoid paying a corporate level tax on the gain realized from the sale.
After repaying $747.5 million of our Operating Partnerships 3.625% exchangeable senior notes on February18, 2014, we maintain substantial liquidity including available cash, as of February21, 2014, of approximately $0.9 billion and approximately $989.4 million available under our Operating Partnerships $1.0billion Unsecured Line of Credit. Our more significant future funding requirements include $0.7 billion of our development pipeline that remains to be funded through 2017 and approximately $77 million of secured debt (of which our share is approximately $70 million) that matures by the end of 2014. We have access to multiple 56 Table of Contents sources of capital, including current cash balances, public debt and equity markets, secured and unsecured debt markets and potential asset sales to fund our future capital requirements.
For descriptions of significant transactions that we completed during 2013, see Item 1. BusinessTransactions During 2013 .
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate that constitutes a business, which includes the consolidation of previously unconsolidated joint ventures,, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.
The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1)the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2)managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below- market leases. Acquired above- and below-market lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
57 Table of Contents Management reviews its long-lived assets for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such criteria are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value, less cost to sell.
Guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 Property Plant and Equipment (ASC 360) requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that a sale of the property within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets, and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value, less cost to sell.
Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. We expense costs that we incur to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in ASC 835-20 Capitalization of Interest and ASC 970 Real EstateGeneral. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs.
The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We begin the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1)substantially completed, (2)occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction or (3)if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended.
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures We consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. VIEs are entities in which the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their endeavors without additional financial support or that the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have a controlling 58 Table of Contents financial interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1)the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entitys performance, and (2)the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that would be significant to the variable interest entity. For ventures that are not VIEs we consolidate entities for which we have significant decision making control over the ventures operations. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entitys governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. In addition to evaluating control rights, we consolidate entities in which the outside partner has no substantive kick-out rights to remove us as the managing member.
Accounts of the consolidated entity are included in our accounts and the non-controlling interest is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of equity or in temporary equity between liabilities and equity. Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity investment is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses; however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. We may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. The ultimate realization of the investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary.
To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of ASC970-323 Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASC 970-323), we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partners interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.
The combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition Contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. We recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements.
59 Table of Contents For the year ended December31, 2013, the impact of the net adjustments of rents from above- and below-market leases increased rental revenue by approximately $28.0 million. For the year ended December31, 2013, the impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately $65.8 million. Those amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above- and below-market leases and straight-line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are disclosed in Note5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we:  review relevant financial information, including:  financial ratios;  net worth;  revenue;  cash flows;  leverage; and  liquidity;  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team; and  assess the strength/growth of the tenants industry.
As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenants credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we:  require a security deposit; and/or  reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters.
We consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease.
Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. A rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. A rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include:  payment history;  credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric);  change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize);  tenant financial performance;  economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and  industry specific credit considerations.
60 Table of Contents If our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 6.6 years as of December31, 2013. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in ASC 605-45 Principal Agent Considerations (ASC 605-45). ASC 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis.
Our parking revenues are derived from leases, monthly parking and transient parking. We recognize parking revenue as earned.
Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.
We receive management and development fees from third parties. Property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third-party partners ownership interest.
Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360-20 Real Estate Sales (ASC 360-20). The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.
Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. We allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to its components and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
We follow the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements when valuing our financial instruments for disclosure purposes. We determine the fair value of our unsecured senior notes and unsecured exchangeable 61 Table of Contents senior notes using market prices. The inputs used in determining the fair value of our unsecured senior notes and unsecured exchangeable senior notes is categorized at a level 1 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) due to the fact that we use quoted market rates to value these instruments. However, the inputs used in determining the fair value could be categorized at a level 2 basis if trading volumes are low. We determine the fair value of our mortgage notes payable using discounted cash flow analyses by discounting the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on current market rates for similar securities. In determining the current market rates, we add our estimates of market spreads to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our debt. The inputs used in determining the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and mezzanine notes payable are categorized at a level 3 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) due to the fact that we consider the rates used in the valuation techniques to be unobservable inputs.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivatives effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. We account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. We account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings.
Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
At December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 175, 157 and 153 properties, respectively (in each case, the Total Property Portfolio). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in service throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio) and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Placed In-Service, Acquired or Consolidated or Development or Redevelopment Portfolios.
In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or consolidated or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in service through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or consolidated, repositioned or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.
Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests, discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, impairment loss, transaction costs, general and administrative expense, less gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt, 62 Table of Contents gains (losses) from investments in securities, gains on consolidation of joint ventures, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.
Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. NOI excludes certain components from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. For a reconciliation of NOI to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc., see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Comparison of the year ended December31, 2013 to the year ended December31, 2012 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio.

Residential Net Operating Income for the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012 are comprised of Residential Revenue of $22,163 and $20,568 less Residential Expenses of $11,770 and $10,992, respectively. Hotel Net Operating Income for the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012 are comprised of Hotel Revenue of $40,330 and $37,915 less Hotel Expenses of $28,447 and $28,120, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
64 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.1 million for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily the result of an increase of approximately $46.9 million in rental revenue from our leases and increases in parking and other recoveries of approximately $4.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in other income of approximately $0.9million. The increase in parking was primarily related to transient parking. The increase in rental revenue from our leases of approximately $46.9 million was the result of our average revenue increasing by approximately $0.97 per square foot, contributing approximately $29.5 million, and an approximately $17.4 million increase due to an increase in average occupancy from 91.4% to 92.3%.
For 2014, we expect continued improvement in our occupancy to result in an increase in Same Property Portfolio net operating income of approximately 1.25% to 2.5% compared to 2013. We are expecting occupancy to average between 92.5% to 93.5% for 2014.
Termination Income Termination income decreased by approximately $5.2 million for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012.
Termination income for the year ended December31, 2013 related to twenty-two tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $2.4 million, of which approximately $1.0 million was negotiated termination income from one of our Reston, Virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant.
Termination income for the year ended December31, 2012 related to twenty-eight tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $7.6 million of which approximately $3.6 million was from the settlement of a bankruptcy claim against a former tenant that rejected our lease in 2009 and approximately $0.9million was a negotiated termination from one of our Reston, Virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant.
Real Estate Operating Expenses Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $24.1 million for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to (1)an increase of approximately $13.9 million, or 5.3%, in real estate taxes, which increases primarily occurred in our Boston and New York regions, (2)an increase of approximately $4.9 million, or 5.3%, in utilities expense, that was primarily due to an increase in the delivery rate for steam in the Boston region, (3)an increase of approximately $5.3 million, or 5.8%, in property repairs and maintenance expense and (4)an increase of approximately $3.2 million, or 2.3%, in other operating expenses. This was partially offset by an approximately $3.2 million cumulative non-cash straight-line adjustment for ground rent expense that occurred in 2012 and did not recur in 2013.
We have modified the presentation of expenses to operate our San Francisco and Princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in our San Francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. These expenses, which totaled approximately $8.1 million and $7.7 million for the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were previously included in Rental Operating Expenses and are now included in General and Administrative Expenses for all periods presented.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $3.5million, or 0.9%, for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012.
65 Table of Contents Properties Acquired or Consolidated Portfolio On March1, 2012, we acquired 453 Ravendale Drive located in Mountain View, California for a purchase price of approximately $6.7 million in cash. 453 Ravendale Drive is an approximately 30,000 net rentable square foot Office/Technical property.
On March13, 2012, we acquired 100 Federal Street in Boston, Massachusetts for an aggregate investment of approximately $615.0 million in cash. In connection with the transaction, we entered into a long-term lease with an affiliate of Bank of America for approximately 732,000 square feet. 100 Federal Street is an approximately 1,265,000 net rentable square foot, 37-story ClassA office tower.
On October4, 2012, we completed the formation of a joint venture which owns and operates Fountain Square located in Reston, Virginia, adjacent to our other Reston properties. Fountain Square is an office and retail complex aggregating approximately 756,000 net rentable square feet, comprised of approximately 522,000 net rentable square feet of ClassA office space and approximately 234,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. We own 50% of, and are consolidating, the joint venture.
On April10, 2013, we acquired the Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park properties from the Value-Added Fund for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $233.1 million. Prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the properties was approximately 39.5%. As a result of the acquisition, we own 100% of the properties and account for them on a consolidated basis. Mountain View Research Park is an approximately 604,000 net rentable square foot, sixteen building Office/Technical complex. Mountain View Technology Park is an approximately 135,000 net rentable square foot, seven building Office/Technical complex.
On May31, 2013, our two joint venture partners in 767 Venture, LLC (the entity that owns 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) in New York City) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. In connection with the transfer, we and our new joint venture partners modified our relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. These changes resulted in us having sufficient financial and operating control over 767 Venture, LLC such that we now account for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 Venture, LLC on a consolidated basis in our financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting. Our ownership interest in 767 Venture, LLC remained unchanged at 60%. 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) is an approximately 1.8million net rentable square foot, 59-story ClassA office tower.

Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio We had six properties that were placed in-service or partially placed in-service between January1, 2012 and December31, 2013. The square footage amount for the four properties that are fully placed in-service is approximately 1.1 million. One and Two Patriots Park is a two-phase redevelopment project for a single tenant.

Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio consisted primarily of our 601 Massachusetts Avenue property located in Washington, DC.
On April25, 2013, we commenced development of our 601 Massachusetts Avenue property, which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior to the commencement of development, this building was operational and, during the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012, had revenue of approximately $2.2 million and $7.1 million, respectively, and operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million and $1.1million, respectively. In addition, the decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million is the result of the property being taken out of service on April25, 2013 and therefore not incurring a full year of depreciation expense.
Other Operating Income and Expense Items Residential Net Operating Income Net operating income for our residential properties increased by approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012.
68 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for The Lofts at Atlantic Wharf and the Residences on The Avenue for the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012.

(2) Average Economic Occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential propertys total possible gross revenue. Market Rents used by us in calculating Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential propertys units and publicly available market data. Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
(3) Average Monthly Rental Rates are calculated by us as rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted monthly average number of occupied units.
Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property increased by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to improvements in revenue per available room (REVPAR) and occupancy. We expect our hotel net operating income for fiscal 2014 to be between $12 million and $13 million.
The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the Cambridge Center Marriott hotel for the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012.
2013 2012 Percentage Change Occupancy 79.8 % 78.8 % 1.3 % Average daily rate $ 233.95 $ 226.58 3.3 % REVPAR $ 186.71 $ 178.66 4.5 % Development and Management Services Development and management services income decreased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was due to decreases in development and management fee income of approximately $1.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The decrease in development fees is primarily due to a decrease in fees associated with tenant improvement project management. The net decrease in management fees is due primarily to a decrease in management fees earned from our joint ventures primarily due to the consolidation/acquisition of 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) and the Mountain View assets and the sale of 125 West 55th Street in New York City, partially offset by an increase in tenant service income. We expect fee income for fiscal 2014 to be between $19 million and $22 million. Our 2014 estimates are 69 Table of Contents less than 2013 due to the conclusion of several fee development projects in Washington, DC and Boston as well as the change in the accounting for 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building). As a result of the consolidation of 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building), the management fees for the building that were approximately $5 million per year will no longer be recognized as fee income. Instead our partners 40% share will be reflected as an adjustment to noncontrolling interest in property partnerships.
General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $25.2 million for the year ended December31, 2013 compared to 2012. On March11, 2013, we announced that Owen D. Thomas would succeed Mortimer B. Zuckerman as our Chief Executive Officer, effective April2, 2013. Mr.Zuckerman will continue to serve as Executive Chairman for a transition period and thereafter is expected to continue to serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.In connection with succession planning, Mr.Zuckerman entered into a Transition Benefits Agreement with us. If Mr.Zuckerman remains employed by us through July1, 2014, he will be entitled to receive, on January1, 2015, a lump sum cash payment of $6.7 million and an equity award with a targeted value of approximately $11.1 million. The cash payment and equity award vest one-third on each of March10, 2013,October1, 2013 and July1, 2014, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. As a result, we recognized approximately $13.8 million of compensation expense during the year ended December31, 2013. We expect to recognize the remaining approximately $4.0 million of compensation expense over the remaining vesting period and, accordingly, expect to expense approximately $2.0 million in each of the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2014. In addition, the agreement provides that if Mr.Zuckerman terminates his employment with us for any reason, voluntarily or involuntarily, he will become fully vested in any outstanding equity awards with time-based vesting. As a result, during the year ended December31, 2013, we accelerated the remaining approximately $12.9 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with Mr.Zuckermans unvested long-term equity awards. During the year ended December31, 2012, we recognized approximately $4.6 million of amortization that occurred prior to the accelerated vesting of the $12.9 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the Transition Benefits Agreement. The remaining increase was primarily due to (1)an approximately $2.6 million increase related to the issuance of the 2013 MYLTIP Units and non-qualified stock options, (2)an approximately $1.3 million increase in health insurance costs, (3)an approximately $1.7 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan, (4)an approximately $0.8 million increases in taxes and (5)an approximately $3.1 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, which includes compensation expenses. This increase was partially offset by (1)approximately $1.9 million of amortization that occurred for a member of senior management in 2012 that did not recur in 2013 due to the fact that this person reached retirement age and therefore became fully vested in time-based equity awards and we no longer recognized expense on a quarterly basis and (2)our recognition of approximately $4.5 million of expense during the first quarter of 2012 in connection with the resignation of E. Mitchell Norville, our Chief Operating Officer, on February29, 2012, which did not recur in 2013.
We have modified the presentation of expenses to operate our San Francisco and Princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in our San Francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. These expenses, which totaled approximately $8.1 million and $7.7 million for the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were previously included in Rental Operating Expenses and are now included in General and Administrative Expenses for all periods presented. We expect our fiscal 2014 general and administrative expenses to be between $100 million and $104 million, which includes approximately $1.2million associated with the termination of the 2011 OPP Awards. Refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate.

79 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $14.8 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily the result of an increase of approximately $9.3 million in rental revenue from our leases and increases in parking and other income of approximately $3.4million and $2.1 million, respectively. The increase in rental revenue from our leases of approximately $9.3million was the result of our average revenue increasing by approximately $0.47 per square foot, contributing approximately $13.3 million, offset by an approximately $4.0 million decrease due to a decline in average occupancy from 92.5% to 92.2%.
Termination Income Termination income increased by approximately $3.4 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011.
Termination income for the year ended December31, 2012 related to twenty-three tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $7.0 million of which approximately $3.6 million was from the settlement of a bankruptcy claim against a former tenant that rejected our lease in 2009 and approximately $0.9million was a negotiated termination from one of our Reston, Virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant.
Termination income for the year ended December31, 2011 related to fourteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $3.6 million, which included approximately $1.8 million of termination income related to a default by a 30,000 square foot law firm tenant in one of our New York City properties.
Real Estate Operating Expenses Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $20.9 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011. This increase was primarily due to (1)an increase of approximately $13.4 million, or 5.7% in real estate taxes, which primarily occurred in our Boston, New York and Washington, DC regions, (2)an approximately $3.2 million cumulative non-cash straight-line adjustment for ground rent expense (refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (3)an approximately $4.3 million, or 1.4%, increase in other property operating expenses.
We have modified the presentation of expenses to operate our San Francisco and Princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in our San Francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. These expenses, which totaled approximately $7.7 million and $7.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were previously included in Rental Operating Expenses and are now included in General and Administrative Expenses for all periods presented.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $4.3million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011.
Properties Acquired Portfolio On February1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Bay Colony Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $185.0 million. Bay Colony Corporate Center is an approximately 985,000 net rentable square foot, four-building ClassA office park situated on a 58-acre site in Waltham, Massachusetts.

On March1, 2012, we acquired 453 Ravendale Drive located in Mountain View, California for a purchase price of approximately $6.7 million in cash. 453 Ravendale Drive is an approximately 30,000 net rentable square foot Office/Technical property.
On March13, 2012, we acquired 100 Federal Street in Boston, Massachusetts for an aggregate investment of approximately $615.0 million in cash. In connection with the transaction, we entered into a long-term lease with an affiliate of Bank of America for approximately 732,000 square feet. 100 Federal Street is an approximately 1,265,000 net rentable square foot, 37-story ClassA office tower.
On October4, 2012, we completed the formation of a joint venture which owns and operates Fountain Square located in Reston, Virginia, adjacent to our other Reston properties. Fountain Square is an office and retail complex aggregating approximately 756,000 net rentable square feet, comprised of approximately 522,000 net rentable square feet of ClassA office space and approximately 234,000 net rentable square feet of retail space.

Under the agreements, the existing tenant terminated early its leases for approximately 523,000 square feet at the complex and was responsible for certain payments to us aggregating approximately $15.7 million. During the year ended December31, 2011, we recognized approximately $13.1 million of termination income related to these agreements, of which approximately $10.5 million is included within the Development or Redevelopment Portfolio. One of the three buildings, One Patriots Park, has been redeveloped and placed back in-service and is now occupied by a new tenant.
Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio increased approximately $20.3 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011, as detailed below: Property Quarter Initially Placed In-Service Quarter Fully Placed In-Service RealEstateOperatingExpenses fortheyearendedDecember31, 2012 2011 Change (in thousands) 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue First Quarter, 2011 Third Quarter, 2011 $ 18,307 $ 11,326 $ 6,981 Residences on The Avenue Second Quarter, 2011 Third Quarter, 2011 9,317 4,958 4,359 The Lofts at Atlantic Wharf Third Quarter, 2011 Third Quarter, 2011 1,675 521 1,154 Atlantic WharfOffice First Quarter, 2011 FourthQuarter,2011 15,005 10,804 4,201 510 Madison Avenue Second Quarter, 2011 SecondQuarter,2012 6,223 2,995 3,228 One Patriots Park SecondQuarter,2012 SecondQuarter,2012 1,364 957 407 Total $ 51,891 $ 31,561 $ 20,330 82 Table of Contents Real estate operating expenses for 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue and the Residences on The Avenue include ground rent expense, which includes the non-cash straight-lining of the ground rent expense of approximately $11.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2012 and $6.7 million and $2.8million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2011.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio decreased by approximately $1.6 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011. Approximately $17.6million of the decrease in depreciation expense for One Patriots Park was the result of the acceleration of depreciation expense during the year ended December31, 2011 in conjunction with the building being taken out of service for redevelopment. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $16.0 million in depreciation expense at the other buildings that were placed in-service.
Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio consisted primarily of our 250 West 55th Street development project located in New York City and our Two Patriots Park property located in Reston, Virginia.
On February6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 989,000 square foot office project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December31, 2011, we recognized approximately $0.8 million of additional costs associated with the suspension and ongoing maintenance of the development project. On May24, 2011, we signed a lease with the law firm of Morrison& Foerster LLP for approximately 184,000 square feet at 250 West 55 th Street and resumed construction of the project. As a result of our decision to resume development, in May 2011 we began interest capitalization and are no longer expensing costs associated with this project.
On July1, 2011, we entered into lease amendments with the existing tenant at our three-building complex on Sunrise Valley Drive in Reston, Virginia, which will be redeveloped as the headquarters for a government related tenant.Under the agreements, the existing tenant terminated early its leases for approximately 523,000 square feet at the complex and was responsible for certain payments to us aggregating approximately $15.7million. We recognized approximately $13.1 million of such termination income during 2011 of which approximately $2.6 million is included within the Placed In-Service Portfolio. We recognized the remaining approximately $2.6 million during the year ended December31, 2012. On January3, 2012, we commenced the redevelopment of our Two Patriots Park property at the complex, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2013. During the year ended December31, 2011, this building had revenue, excluding the $10.5 million of termination income, of approximately $10.2 million and operating expenses of approximately $1.7 million. During the year ended December31, 2012, excluding termination income, this building had de minimis revenue and operating expenses. In addition, the decrease in depreciation of approximately $16.7million is the result of the acceleration of depreciation expense during the year ended December31, 2011 in conjunction with the redevelopment of this building.
Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property increased by approximately $1.4million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to improvements in revenue per available room (REVPAR) and occupancy.
83 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the Cambridge Center Marriott hotel for the year ended December31, 2012 and 2011.
2012 2011 Percentage Change Occupancy 78.8 % 78.2 % 0.8 % Average daily rate $ 226.58 $ 210.45 7.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 178.66 $ 164.15 8.8 % Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in development fee income of approximately $2.5 million partially offset by a decrease in management fee income of approximately $1.8million. The increase in development fees is primarily due to an increase in fees associated with tenant improvement project management. The decrease in management fees is due to a decrease in leasing fees and management fees earned from our joint venture and third-party managed properties, as a result of decreases in leasing activity and third-party properties that we managed.
General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.0 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011. We recognized approximately $4.5 million of expense during the first quarter of 2012 in connection with the resignation of E. Mitchell Norville, our Chief Operating Officer, on February29, 2012. This increase was partially offset by the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense totaling approximately $4.3 million associated with the termination of the 2008 OPP Awards during the first quarter of 2011, which did not recur in 2012. The remaining increase was primarily due to (1)an approximately $3.0million increase related to the issuance of the 2012 OPP Awards and non-qualified stock options and (2)an approximately $1.5 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan, partially offset by an approximately $1.7 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses, which includes a decrease in compensation expense.
We have modified the presentation of expenses to operate our San Francisco and Princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in our San Francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. These expenses, which totaled approximately $7.7 million and $7.5 million for the year ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were previously included in Rental Operating Expenses and are now included in General and Administrative Expenses for all periods presented.
Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $12.7 million and $11.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
Transaction Costs During the year ended December31, 2012 we incurred approximately $3.7 million of transaction costs of which approximately $0.6 million related to the acquisition of 680 Folsom Street in San Francisco, California, approximately $0.5 million related to the acquisition of Fountain Square in Reston, Virginia, approximately $0.3million related to the forming of a joint venture to pursue the acquisition of land in San Francisco, California to construct the Transbay Tower, approximately $0.6 million related to the acquisition of 100 Federal Street in Boston, Massachusetts and approximately $1.7million related to the pursuit of other transactions. During the year ended December31, 2011, we incurred approximately $2.0 million of transaction pursuit costs.
84 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Items Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures For the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by approximately $36.8 million. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of Two Grand Central Tower during the year ended December31, 2011, in which we recognized a gain of approximately $46.2 million, partially offset by an increase of approximately $2.0 million in our share of the net income from 767 Fifth Avenue (The General Motors Building) and an increase of approximately $7.4 million in our share of net income from our other unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase at 767 Fifth Avenue (The General Motors Building) was primarily due to a lease termination agreement with an existing tenant and lower amortization expense of approximately $6.7 million due to expiring leases.Under that agreement, the tenant terminated early its lease for approximately 36,000 square feet at the building and is responsible for certain payments aggregating approximately $28.4 million through May1, 2014 (of which our share is approximately $17.0 million). As a result of the termination, we recognized termination income totaling approximately $11.8 million (which is net of the write-off of the accrued straight-line rent balance) during the year ended December31, 2012. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in above- and below-market lease income of approximately $13.8 million and accrued straight-line rent of approximately $2.7 million at 767 Fifth Avenue (The General Motors Building).
On October25, 2011, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 60% interest completed the sale of Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City for approximately $401.0 million, including the assumption by the buyer of approximately $176.6 million of mortgage indebtedness. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $210.0 million, of which our share was approximately $126.0 million, after the payment of transaction costs of approximately $14.4 million. Two Grand Central Tower is an approximately 650,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office tower. The unconsolidated joint ventures carrying value of the net assets of the property aggregated approximately $427.1 million. As a result, pursuant to the provisions of ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), the unconsolidated joint venture recognized a non-cash impairment loss and loss on sale of real estate aggregating approximately $40.5 million during the year ended December31, 2011, which is equal to the difference between (1)the sale price less cost to sell and (2)the carrying value of the net assets of the property. Separately, in 2008 we had recognized an impairment loss on our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture totaling approximately $74.3 million under the provisions of ASC 323 Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASC 323). As a result, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $46.2 million, which is included within income from unconsolidated joint ventures on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011. Interest income for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011 increased approximately $1.3 million due primarily to the approximately $0.9 million of interest income that we recognized related to the loans that we made to our Value-Added Fund and an increase in the average cash balance that was partially offset by overall lower interest rates. The loans to the Value-Added Fund have been reflected in Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The average daily cash balances for the year ended December31, 2012 and December31, 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
Other income for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011 increased by approximately $3.4million of which (1)approximately $2.9 million related to the sale of historic tax credits at our Lofts at Atlantic Wharf, (2)approximately $1.1 million was related to an insurance claim that we received during 2012 and (3)approximately $0.2 million related to a sales deposit we retained due to a prospective buyer of 164 Lexington Road canceling the contract, partially offset by the approximately $0.8 million recognized during 2011 related to 280 Park Avenue (as detailed below). On October20, 2010, we closed a transaction with a financial institution (the HTC Investor) related to the historic rehabilitation of the residential component of our Atlantic Wharf 85 Table of Contents development in Boston, Massachusetts (the residential project). The HTC Investor has contributed an aggregate of approximately $15 million to the project. As part of its contribution, the HTC Investor will receive substantially all of the benefits derived from the tax credits. Beginning in July 2012 to July 2016, we recognized and will recognize the cash received as revenue over the five-year tax credit recapture period as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. During the year ended December31, 2012, we recognized approximately $2.9 million of the $15 million that the HTC Investor had contributed to us.
On June6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue in New York City.In connection with the sale, in lieu of a closing adjustment in favor of the buyer for certain unfunded tenant improvements, we retained the obligation to pay for the improvements, subject to the tenant initiating the request for reimbursement. The total amount of unfunded tenant improvements at closing was approximately $1.0 million and has yet to be requested by the tenants.During the year ended December31, 2011, a tenants lease expired for which we had unfunded tenant improvement liabilities of approximately $0.8 million, resulting in the recognition of other income in that amount.
Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities Gains (losses) from investments in securities for the year ended December31, 2012 and 2011 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk.

In connection with the repurchase and redemption in February 2012 of our Operating Partnerships 2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2037, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.1 million related to the expensing of transaction related costs.
On November9, 2011, our Operating Partnership repurchased $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 for approximately $50.2million.

As properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed.
Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $44.3 million and $48.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
At December31, 2012, our variable rate debt consisted of our Operating Partnerships $750.0 million Unsecured Line of Credit, of which no amount was outstanding at December31, 2012.
88 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations On May17, 2012, we completed the sale of our Bedford Business Park properties located in Bedford, Massachusetts for approximately $62.8 million in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $62.0 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $36.9 million. Bedford Business Park is comprised of two Office/Technical buildings and one ClassA office building aggregating approximately 470,000 net rentable square feet. The operating results of the property through the date of sale have been classified as discontinued operations on a historical basis for all periods presented. Refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the sale and operating results.
Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consisted of the outside owners equity interest in the income from our 505 9 th Street and Fountain Square properties as of December31, 2012 and only 505 9 th Street as of December31, 2011.
On October4, 2012, we completed the formation of a joint venture which owns and operates Fountain Square located in Reston, Virginia, adjacent to our other Reston properties. Fountain Square is an office and retail complex aggregating approximately 756,000 net rentable square feet, comprised of approximately 522,000 net rentable square feet of ClassA office space and approximately 234,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. The joint venture partner contributed the property valued at approximately $385.0 million and related mortgage indebtedness totaling approximately $211.3 million for a 50% interest in the joint venture. We contributed cash totaling approximately $87.0 million for our 50% interest, which cash was distributed to the joint venture partner. We are consolidating this joint venture. The mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.71%per annum and matures on October11, 2016. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement (i)we have rights to acquire the partners 50% interest and (ii)the partner has the right to cause us to acquire the partners interest on January4, 2016, in each case at a fixed price totaling approximately $102.0 million in cash. The fixed price option rights expire on January31, 2016.
Noncontrolling InterestCommon Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest-common units of the Operating Partnership decreased by approximately $5.0million for the year ended December31, 2012 compared to 2011 due to a decrease in allocable income and a decrease in the noncontrolling interests ownership percentage.
Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:  fund normal recurring expenses;  meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt;  fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;  fund development costs;  fund possible property acquisitions; and  make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
89 Table of Contents We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:  cash flow from operations;  distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;  cash and cash equivalent balances;  issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership;  our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit or other short-term bridge facilities;  construction loans;  long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); and  sales of real estate.
We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. Although we generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed by our Operating Partnership, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the projects size and duration, the extent of pre-leasing and our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

90 Table of Contents Contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, and development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. We believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs.
Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in the cash provided by our operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes.
Since January1, 2013, we raised net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion in the capital markets. Specifically, we issued $200 million of 5.25% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, and our Operating Partnership issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.800% senior unsecured notes due 2024. In addition, we repaid approximately $65 million of secured debt, and we redeemed/repurchased our Operating Partnerships $450 million 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 and repaid $747.5 million of our Operating Partnerships 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due February 2014 and our Operating Partnership redeemed 861,400 Series Four Preferred Units at a redemption price of $50.00 per unit plus accrued and unpaid distributions. In addition, we refinanced the loans secured by 540 Madison Avenue and 500 North Capitol Street, which aggregate approximately $225 million (of which our share is approximately $104 million), obtained $22million of construction financing for our Annapolis Junction Building Seven development project and exercised an option to extend the maturity date on an approximately $14 million loan for our Annapolis Junction Building Six property (of which our share is approximately $7 million). On July26, 2013, our Operating Partnership amended and restated the revolving credit agreement governing its Unsecured Line of Credit, which, among other things, (1)increased the total commitment from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion, (2)extended the maturity date from June24, 2014 to July26, 2018 and (3)reduced per annum variable rates and other fees.
The completion of our ongoing developments, through 2017, has remaining costs to fund of approximately $0.7 billion. We have approximately $77 million of secured debt (of which our share is approximately $70million) expiring through the end of 2014. We believe that our strong liquidity, including available cash as of February21, 2014 of approximately $0.9 billion, the approximately $989.4 million available under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and proceeds from potential asset sales provide sufficient capacity to meet our debt obligations and fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development projects, our foreseeable potential development activity and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. Given the relatively low interest rates currently available to us in the debt markets, we may seek to enhance our liquidity in the future, which may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our Operating Partnerships use of the proceeds. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase unsecured senior notes and unsecured exchangeable senior notes for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or both. We will evaluate any such potential transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account the trading prices of the notes, our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital.
REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend As a REIT we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at 91 Table of Contents least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. On December2, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $2.25 per common share payable on January29, 2014 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December31, 2013. The decision to declare a special dividend was primarily a result of the sale of a 45% interest in our Times Square Tower property in October 2013. The Board of Directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. Holders of common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership, our Operating Partnership, as of the close of business on December31, 2013 received the same distribution on January29, 2014. On November8, 2012, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend from $0.55 per common share to $0.65 per common share. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate our dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income, liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by our Board of Directors will not differ materially.
Sales To the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $2.4 billion and $1.0 billion at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $1.4 billion. The following table sets forth changes in cash flows: Year ended December31, 2013 2012 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 777,926 $ 642,949 $ 134,977 Net cash used in investing activities (532,640 ) (1,278,032 ) 745,392 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,077,873 (146,147 ) 1,224,020 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our in-place tenant leases, including our unconsolidated joint ventures, is approximately 6.6 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 91% to 94%. Our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties, secured and unsecured borrowings and equity offerings.
Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain their market position. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December31, 2013 and 2012 consisted primarily of funding our development projects and the acquisitions 92 Table of Contents of 453 Ravendale Drive, 100 Federal Street, Fountain Square, 680 Folsom Street, 535 Mission Street and the Mountain View Research and Technology Parks and the Transbay Tower and Reston, Virginia land parcels, offset by cash from the disposition of 10& 20 Burlington Mall Road, One Preserve Parkway, 1301 New York Avenue, 303 Almaden Boulevard and Bedford Business Park, as detailed below: Year ended December31, 2013 2012 (in thousands) Acquisitions of real estate $ (522,900 ) $ (788,052 ) Construction in progress (396,835 ) (356,397 ) Building and other capital improvements (73,821 ) (49,943 ) Tenant improvements (105,425 ) (139,662 ) Proceeds from sales of real estate 250,078 61,963 Cash recorded upon consolidation 79,468  Issuance of notes receivable, net 12,491 (2,049 ) Capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures  (6,214 ) Capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 225,862 3,557 Investments in securities, net (1,558 ) (1,235 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (532,640 ) $ (1,278,032 ) Cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following:  On March1, 2012, we acquired 453 Ravendale Drive located in Mountain View, California for a purchase price of approximately $6.7 million in cash.

In addition, we incurred costs associated with the continued development and redevelopment of Two Patriots Park, Seventeen Cambridge Center, The Avant at Reston Town Center, the Cambridge Center Connector, 250West 55 th Street and 680 Folsom Street. Construction in progress for the year ended December31, 2013 includes ongoing expenditures associated with our Two Patriots Park and Seventeen Cambridge Center properties and the Cambridge Center Connector, which were fully placed in-service during the year ended December31, 2013.

On December20, 2013, we completed the sale of our One Preserve Parkway property located in Rockville, Maryland for a sale price of approximately $61.3 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $59.9 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $5.9 million.
We recorded approximately $79.5 million of cash upon consolidating the joint venture that owns 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $222.3 million due to the sale of the Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project and 125 West 55th Street in New York City and the Value-Added Fund selling Mountain View Research and Technology Parks.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December31, 2013 totaled approximately $1.1billion.

Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Capitalization  Debt Financing.
94 Table of Contents Capitalization At December31, 2013, our total consolidated debt was approximately $11.3 billion. The GAAP weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 4.60% (with a coupon/stated rate of 4.93%) and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.4 years.
Consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total consolidated market capitalization was approximately $28.7 billion at December31, 2013. Our total consolidated market capitalization was calculated using the December31, 2013 closing stock price of $100.37 per common share and the following: (1)152,983,101 shares of our common stock, (2)15,583,370 outstanding common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership (excluding common units held by us), (3)an aggregate of 874,168 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Series Two Preferred Units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership, (4)an aggregate of 1,455,761 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, (5)360,126 Series Four Preferred Units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership multiplied by the fixed liquidation preference of $50per unit, (6)80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share), of our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, at a price of $2,500 per share ($25 per depositary share) and (7)our consolidated debt totaling approximately $11.3 billion. Our total consolidated debt, which excludes debt collateralized by our unconsolidated joint ventures, at December31, 2013, represented approximately 39.50% of our total consolidated market capitalization.
Following the consolidation of 767 Venture, LLC (the entity that owns 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building)), effective June1, 2013, our consolidated debt increased significantly compared to prior periods even though our economic interest in 767 Venture, LLC remained substantially unchanged. As a result, we believe the presentation of total adjusted debt may provide investors with a more complete picture of our share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt. Total adjusted debt is defined as our total consolidated debt, plus our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, minus our joint venture partners share of consolidated debt, and was approximately $10.8 billion at December31, 2013. In addition, in light of the difference between our total consolidated debt and our total adjusted debt, we believe that also presenting our total adjusted debt to total adjusted market capitalization ratio may provide investors with a more complete picture of our leverage in relation to the overall size of our company. The calculation of the total adjusted debt to total adjusted market capitalization ratio is the same as consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio except that the total adjusted debt balance is used in lieu of the total consolidated debt balance. Our total adjusted debt at December31, 2013, represented approximately 38.31% of our total adjusted market capitalization.
The calculation of total consolidated and adjusted market capitalization does not include 396,500 2011 OPP Units, 396,150 2012 OPP Units and 316,325 2013 MYLTIP Units because, unlike other LTIP Units, they are not earned until certain return thresholds are achieved. These percentages will fluctuate with changes in the market value of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio and the adjusted debt to total adjusted market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

95 Table of Contents Debt Financing As of December31, 2013, we had approximately $11.3 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 39.50% of our total consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1)$5.836 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes (excluding exchangeable senior notes) having a weighted-average interest rate of 4.44%per annum and maturities in 2015, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023 and 2024; (2)$744.9 million (net of discount and the adjustment for the equity component allocation) of exchangeable senior notes having a GAAP interest rate of 6.555%per annum (an effective rate of 4.037%, excluding the effect of the adjustment for the equity component allocation) and maturing in 2014; (3)$4.4 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 4.31%per annum and weighted-average term of 4.2 years and (4)$0.3 million of mezzanine notes payable associated with 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building), having a GAAP interest rate of 5.53%per annum and maturing in 2017.

Our Operating Partnership may increase the total commitment to $1.5billion, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. At our Operating Partnerships option, loans outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1), in the case of loans denominated in Dollars, Euro or Sterling, LIBOR or, in the case of loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, 96 Table of Contents CDOR, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.925% to 1.70% based on our Operating Partnerships credit rating or (2)an alternate base rate equal to the greatest of (a)the Administrative Agents prime rate, (b)the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% or (c)LIBOR for a one month period plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.70% based on our Operating Partnerships credit rating. The Unsecured Line of Credit also contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to our Operating Partnership at a reduced interest rate. In addition, our Operating Partnership is also obligated to pay (1)in quarterly installments a facility fee on the total commitment at a rate per annum ranging from 0.125% to 0.35% based on our Operating Partnerships credit rating and (2)an annual fee on the undrawn amount of each letter of credit equal to the LIBOR margin. Based on our Operating Partnerships current credit rating, the LIBOR and CDOR margin is 1.00%, the alternate base rate margin is 0.0% and the facility fee is 0.15%. Our ability to borrow under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including:  a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within one year;  a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%;  a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40;  an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within one year;  an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and  limitations on permitted investments.
We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above.
As of December31, 2013, we had no borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $10.6million outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit, with the ability to borrow approximately $989.4 million. As of February21, 2014, we had no borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $10.6 million outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit, with the ability to borrow approximately $989.4million.

The indenture under which our unsecured senior notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1)a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2)a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3)an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4)unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December31, 2013, we believe we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.

(2) The initial exchange rate is 8.5051 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (or an initial exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of our common stock). In addition, we entered into capped call transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, which are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future exchange of the notes. The capped call transactions were intended to increase the effective exchange price to us of the notes from $117.58 to approximately $137.17 per share (subject to adjustment), representing an overall effective premium of approximately 40% over the closing price on August13, 2008 of $97.98 per share of our common stock. The net cost of the capped call transactions was approximately $44.4 million. In connection with the special dividend declared on November27, 2013, the exchange rate of 8.5051 was adjusted to 8.6974 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December31, 2013, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $114.98 per share of our common stock. As of December31, 2013, the effective exchange price was $130.21 per share. Our Operating Partnership repaid the notes on February18, 2014 (Refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).

All adjustments to reflect loans at their fair value upon acquisition are noted above.
(2) This property is owned by a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 60% interest.
(3) In connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint ventures obligation to fund various escrows, including tenant improvements, taxes and insurance in lieu of cash deposits. As of December31, 2013, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $24.1 million. We earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with our partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee.
(4) The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.
(5) On December19, 2006, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts related to this financing and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount is reducing our GAAP interest expense for this mortgage over the term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.41%per annum for the financing. The stated interest rate is 5.57%per annum.
(6) In connection with the mortgage financing we have agreed to guarantee approximately $15.9 million related to our obligation to provide funds for certain tenant re-leasing costs.
(7) On November13, 2008, we closed on an eight-year, $375.0 million mortgage loan collateralized by this property. The mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.10%per annum. Under our interest rate hedging program, we are reclassifying into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss resulting in an effective interest rate of 7.02%per annum.
(8) This property is owned by a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest.

(3) The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.
Outside Members Notes Payable In conjunction with the consolidation of 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building), we recorded loans payable to the joint ventures partners totaling $450.0 million and related accrued interest payable totaling approximately $175.8 million. The member loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 11.0%per annum and mature on June9, 2017. We have eliminated in consolidation our member loan totaling $270.0 million and our share of the related accrued interest payable of approximately $114.5 million at December31, 2013. The remaining notes payable to the outside joint venture partners and related accrued interest payable totaling $180.0 million and approximately $76.4 million as of December31, 2013 have been reflected as Outside Members Notes Payable and within Accrued Interest Payable, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related interest expense from the Outside Members Notes Payable totaling approximately $16.0 million for the period from May31, 2013 through December31, 2013 is fully allocated to the outside joint venture partners as an adjustment to Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. All of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.
At December31, 2013 our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on all of our outstanding debt, all of which had a fixed interest rate, was 4.93%per annum. At December31, 2013, we had no outstanding variable rate debt. The weighted-average coupon/stated rate for our senior notes and unsecured exchangeable debt was 4.44% and 3.63%, respectively.
100 Table of Contents Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 89.99%, 89.48%, 88.57%, 87.25% and 86.57% for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively,after allocation tothe noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership.
FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
101 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Year ended December31, 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc.

104 Table of Contents Net Operating Income Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, impairment loss from discontinued operations, losses (gains) from early extinguishments of debt, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, suspension of development, impairment loss, transaction costs and general and administrative expense, less gain on forgiveness of debt from discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, income from discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income, gains on consolidation of joint ventures, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.
Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. NOI excludes certain components from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to our properties results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.

(2) Debt was repaid on February18, 2014. Refer to Footnote 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3) Committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of December31, 2013 (tenant improvements and lease commissions).
(4) Includes 100% of the obligations for our consolidated joint ventures and only our share for the unconsolidated joint ventures.
We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally between three to five years.
During 2013, we paid approximately $161.9 million to fund tenant-related obligations, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and incurred approximately $172 million of new tenant-related obligations associated with approximately 4.6million square feet of second generation leases, or approximately $38 per square foot. In addition, we signed leases for approximately 545,000 square feet at our development properties.The tenant-related obligations for the development properties are included within the projects Estimated Total Investment referred to in Item7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources.
In the aggregate, during 2013, we signed leases for approximately 5.1million square feet of space and incurred aggregate tenant-related obligations of approximately $226 million, or approximately $44 per square foot.
Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsJoint Venture Indebtedness We have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 25% to 60%. Six of these joint ventures have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December31, 2013, the aggregate 107 Table of Contents carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $749.7 million (of which our proportionate share is approximately $329.2 million). The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December31, 2013. In addition to other guarantees specifically noted in the table, we have agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of the loans.

Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.
In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1)bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2)continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3)indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.
108 Table of Contents Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have developed an office park on this property. Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.
We expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.
Reclassifications and Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements We have modified the presentation of expenses to operate its San Francisco and Princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in its San Francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. These expenses, which totaled approximately $8.1 million, $7.7 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were previously included in Rental Operating Expenses and are now included in General and Administrative Expenses for all periods presented.
In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No.2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU No.2013-02). ASU No.2013-02 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
109 Table of Contents For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. ASU No.2013-02 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2012. Our adoption of ASU No.2013-02 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations.
Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
As of December31, 2013, approximately $11.3 billion of our consolidated borrowings bore interest at fixed rates and none of our consolidated borrowings bore interest at variable rates. The fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The table below does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt.

At December31, 2013 we had no outstanding variable rate debt. The weighted-average coupon/stated rates for our unsecured debt and unsecured exchangeable debt were 4.44%per annum and 3.63%per annum, respectively.
The fair value amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.

112 Table of Contents Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of Boston Properties, Inc. (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.
As of the end of the Companys 2013 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013 was effective.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page114, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013.
113 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Properties, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization Boston Properties, Inc. (the Company), a Delaware corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). The Company is the sole general partner of Boston Properties Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership) and at December31, 2013 owned an approximate 89.5% (89.0% at December31, 2012) general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are denominated as common units of partnership interest (also referred to as OP Units), long term incentive units of partnership interest (also referred to as LTIP Units) or preferred units of partnership interest (also referred to as Preferred Units). In addition, in February 2011 and February 2012, the Company issued LTIP Units in connection with the granting to employees of outperformance awards (also referred to as 2011 OPP Units and 2012 OPP Units, respectively, and collectively as OPP Units). In February 2013, the Company issued LTIP Units in connection with the granting to employees of 2013 MYLTIP Units (2013 MYLTIP Units). Because the rights, preferences and privileges of OPP Units and 2013 MYLTIP Units differ from other LTIP Units granted to employees as part of the annual compensation process, unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to LTIP Units exclude OPP Units and 2013 MYLTIP Units (See Notes 11 and 17).
Unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership is obligated to redeem such OP Unit for cash equal to the value of a share of common stock of the Company (Common Stock) at such time. In lieu of a cash redemption, the Company may elect to acquire such OP Unit for one share of Common Stock. Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, one share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of one OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted common stock of the Company. LTIP Units, whether vested or not, will receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends on Common Stock (See Note 12).
At December31, 2013, there were three series of Preferred Units outstanding (i.e., Series Two Preferred Units, Series Four Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units).
The Series Two Preferred Units bear a distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Each Series Two Preferred Unit may also be converted into approximately 1.312336 OP Units or redeemed for $50.00 of cash at the election of the holder thereof or the Operating Partnership in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable amendment to the partnership agreement (See Note 11).
The Series Four Preferred Units are not convertible into or exchangeable for any common equity of the Operating Partnership or the Company, have a per unit liquidation preference of $50.00 and are entitled to receive quarterly distributions of $0.25 per unit (or an annual rate of 2.00%) (See Note 11).
The Series B Preferred Units were issued to the Company on March27, 2013 in connection with the Companys issuance of 80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares each representing 1/100th of a share) of 5.25% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock). The Company contributed the net proceeds from the offering to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 80,000 Series B Preferred Units having terms and preferences generally mirroring those of the Series B Preferred Stock (See Note 12).
121 Table of Contents All references herein to the Company refer to Boston Properties, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.
Properties At December31, 2013, the Company owned or had interests in a portfolio of 175 commercial real estate properties (the Properties) aggregating approximately 44.4million net rentable square feet, including nine properties under construction totaling approximately 2.9 millionnet rentable square feet. In addition, the Company has structured parking for approximately 45,234 vehicles containing approximately 15.4million square feet. At December31, 2013, the Properties consist of:  167 office properties, including 128 ClassA office properties (including eight properties under construction) and 39 Office/Technical properties;  one hotel;  four retail properties; and  three residential properties (including one property under construction).
The Company owns or controls undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 503.6 acres.
The Company considers ClassA office properties to be centrally located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. The Company considers Office/Technical properties to be properties that support office, research and development, laboratory and other technical uses. The Companys definitions of ClassA Office and Office/Technical properties may be different than those used by other companies. Net rentable square feet amounts are unaudited.
Basis of Presentation Boston Properties, Inc. does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in the Operating Partnership, nor does it have employees of its own. The Operating Partnership, not Boston Properties, Inc., executes all significant business relationships. All majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures over which the Company has financial and operating control and variable interest entities (VIEs) in which the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary are included in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for all other unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Companys share of the earnings of these joint ventures and companies is included in consolidated net income.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate that constitutes a business, which includes the consolidation of previously unconsolidated joint ventures, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities, and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. The Company assesses and considers fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that it deems appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired 122 Table of Contents property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The Company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on its acquisitions to date, the Companys allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
The Company records acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1)the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2)managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below- market leases. Acquired above- and below-market lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Companys evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
Management reviews its long-lived assets for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such criteria are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, the Companys established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If the Companys strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value, less cost to sell.
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) ASC 360 Property Plant and Equipment requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and the Company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). The Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets, and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value, less cost to sell.
Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. The Company expenses costs that it incurs to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is 123 Table of Contents allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determinations of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involve a degree of judgment. The Companys capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in ASC 835-20 Capitalization of Interest and ASC 970 Real EstateGeneral. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which it defines as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. The Company ceases capitalization on the portion (1)substantially completed and (2)occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction, or if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended. Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $68.2 million, $44.3 million and $48.2 million, respectively. Salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $7.7 million, $7.1million and $6.5 million, respectively.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Significant betterments are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period.
The Company computes depreciation and amortization on properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company allocates the acquisition cost of real estate to its components and depreciates or amortizes these assets (or liabilities) over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Land improvements 25to40 years Buildings and improvements 10to40years Tenant improvements Shorterofusefullifeortermsofrelatedlease Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 to 7 years Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit of $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.
Cash Held in Escrows Escrows include amounts established pursuant to various agreements for security deposits, property taxes, insurance and other costs.
Investments in Securities The Company accounts for investments in trading securities atfair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally 124 Table of Contents determined at acquisition. The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow officers of the Company to defer a portion of their current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals. The Companys obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had maintained approximately $16.6 million and $12.2 million, respectively, in a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. The Company recognized gains (losses) of approximately $2.9 million, $1.4 million and $(0.4) million on its investments in the account associated with the Companys deferred compensation plan during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Tenant and Other Receivables Tenant and other accounts receivable, other than accrued rents receivable, are expected to be collected within one year.
Deferred Charges Deferred charges include leasing costs and financing fees. Leasing costs include an allocation for acquired intangible in-place lease values and direct and incremental fees and costs incurred in the successful negotiation of leases, including brokerage, legal, internal leasing employee salaries and other costs which have been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Internal leasing salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $5.1 million, $5.6million and $4.4 million, respectively. External fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing have been deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans and are included within interest expense. Unamortized financing and leasing costs are charged to expense upon the early repayment or significant modification of the financing or upon the early termination of the lease, respectively. Fully amortized deferred charges are removed from the books upon the expiration of the lease or maturity of the debt.
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary. VIEs are entities in which the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their endeavors without additional financial support or that the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1)the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entitys performance, and (2)the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that would be significant to the variable interest entity. For ventures that are not VIEs the Company consolidates entities for which it has significant decision making control over the ventures operations. The Companys judgment with respect to its level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of the Companys ownership interest, its representation in the entitys governance, the size of its investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, its ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace the Company as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. The Companys assessment of its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition to evaluating control rights, the Company consolidates entities in which the outside partner has no substantive kick-out rights to remove the Company as the managing member.
Accounts of the consolidated entity are included in the accounts of the Company and the non-controlling interest is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of equity or in temporary equity between liabilities and equity. Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an 125 Table of Contents adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the Companys share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses; however, the Companys recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. The Company may account for cash distributions in excess of its investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when the Company is not the general partner in a limited partnership and when the Company has neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture. The Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and the Company records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary, which is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions.
To the extent that the Company contributes assets to a joint venture, the Companys investment in the joint venture is recorded at the Companys cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that the Companys cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in the Companys share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 970-323 InvestmentsEquity Method and Joint Ventures (ASC 970-323), the Company will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partners interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.
Equity Offering Costs Underwriting commissions and offering costs have been reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
Treasury Stock The Companys share repurchases are reflected as treasury stock utilizing the cost method of accounting and are presented as a reduction to consolidated stockholders equity.
Dividends Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, will differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of gains/losses on the sale of real property, revenue and expense recognition, compensation expense, and in the estimated useful lives and basis used to compute depreciation.
The tax treatment of common dividends per share for federal income tax purposes is as follows: For the year ended December31, 2013 2012 2011 PerShare % PerShare % PerShare % Ordinary income $ 2.31 48.71 % $ 2.29 96.45 % $ 2.06 97.39 % Capital gain income 2.44 51.29 % 0.08 3.55 % 0.05 2.61 % Total $ 4.75 (1) 100.00 % $ 2.37 100.00 % $ 2.11 100.00 % (1) The fourth quarter 2013 dividend of $2.90 per common share consists of a $2.25 per common share special dividend and a $0.65 per common share regular quarterly dividend of which approximately $2.44 per common share was allocable to 2013 and approximately $0.46 per common share is allocable to 2014.
126 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately $65.8 million, $77.6 million and $77.0 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as the revenue recorded exceeded amounts billed. Accrued rental income, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents cumulative rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. The Company maintains an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential tenant credit losses. The credit assessment is based on the estimated accrued rental income that is recoverable over the term of the lease. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments. The computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit status, as well as certain industry or geographic specific credit considerations. If the Companys estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of the Companys reported revenue could be impacted. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of the Companys existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of the Companys portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
In accordance with ASC 805, the Company recognizes rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. The impact of the acquired in-place above- and below-market leases increased revenue by approximately $28.0 million, $14.6 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table summarizes the scheduled amortization of the Companys acquired above- and below-market lease intangibles for each of the five succeeding years (in thousands).
AcquiredAbove-Market Lease Intangibles AcquiredBelow-Market Lease Intangibles 2014 $ 23,669 $ 61,700 2015 22,758 55,207 2016 20,576 52,461 2017 12,279 40,346 2018 8,637 37,774 Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in ASC 605-45 Principal Agent Considerations (ASC 605-45). ASC 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as the Company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and has credit risk. The Company also receives reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which the Company reflects on a net basis in accordance with ASC 605-45.
The Companys parking revenues are derived from leases, monthly parking and transient parking. The Company recognizes parking revenue as earned.
The Companys hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.
The Company receives management and development fees from third parties. Property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. The Company reviews each development agreement and records development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest.
127 Table of Contents Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360-20 Real Estate Sales (ASC 360-20). The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, the Company defers some or all of the gain recognition and accounts for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.
Ground Leases The Company has non-cancelable ground lease obligations with various initial term expiration dates through 2068. The Company recognizes ground rent expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective ground lease agreements. The future contractual minimum lease payments to be made by the Company as of December31, 2013, under non-cancelable ground leases which expire on various dates through 2068, are as follows: Years Ending December31, (inthousands) 2014 $ 13,184 2015 13,507 2016 13,732 2017 13,963 2018 14,198 Thereafter 899,187 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, as adjusted for unallocated earnings (if any) of certain securities issued by the Operating Partnership, by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from shares issuable in connection with awards under stock-based compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and securities of the Operating Partnership that are exchangeable for Common Stock.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
The Company follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements when valuing its financial instruments for disclosure purposes. The Company determines the fair value of its unsecured senior notes and unsecured exchangeable senior notes using market prices. The inputs used in determining the fair value of the Companys unsecured senior notes and unsecured exchangeable senior notes is categorized at a level 1 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) due to the fact that the Company uses quoted market rates to value these instruments. However, the inputs used in determining the fair value could be categorized at a level 2 basis if trading volumes are low. The Company determines the fair value of its mortgage notes payable using discounted cash flow analyses by discounting the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on current market rates for similar securities. In determining the current market rates, the Company adds its estimates of market spreads to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to its debt. The inputs used in determining the fair value of the Companys mortgage notes payable and mezzanine notes payable are categorized at a level 3 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) due to the fact that the Company considers the rates used in the valuation techniques to be unobservable inputs.
128 Table of Contents Because the Companys valuations of its financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair values of its financial instruments may differ materially if the Companys estimates do not prove to be accurate. The following table presents the aggregate carrying value of the Companys indebtedness and the Companys corresponding estimate of fair value as of December31, 2013 and December31, 2012 (in thousands): December31, 2013 December31, 2012 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Mortgage notes payable $ 4,449,734 $ 4,545,283 $ 3,102,485 $ 3,256,940 Mezzanine notes payable 311,040 311,064   Unsecured senior notes 5,835,854 6,050,517 4,639,528 5,162,486 Unsecured exchangeable senior notes 744,880 (1) 750,266 1,170,356 (1) 1,278,554 Total $ 11,341,508 $ 11,657,130 $ 8,912,369 $ 9,697,980 (1) Includes the net adjustment for the equity component allocation totaling approximately $2.4 million and $25.5 million at December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, respectively.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivatives effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. The Company accounts for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassifies the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company accounts for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings.
Income Taxes The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), commencing with its taxable year ended December31, 1997. As a result, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. The Companys policy is to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income. Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the Companys consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries. The Companys taxable REIT subsidiaries did not have significant tax provisions or deferred income tax items. The Company has no uncertain tax positions recognized as of December31, 2013 and 2012.
The Company owns a hotel property which is managed through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is the lessee pursuant to the lease for the hotel property. As lessor, the Operating Partnership is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreement. The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax at the federal and state level and, accordingly, the Company has recorded a tax provision in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
The net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities is approximately $1.7 billion and $0.8 billion as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which is primarily related to the difference in basis of contributed property and accrued rental income.
129 Table of Contents Certain entities included in the Companys consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state and local taxes. These taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The following table reconciles GAAP net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. to taxable income: For the year ended December31, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) Net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc.

Effective January1, 2005, the Company adopted early ASC 718 CompensationStock Compensation (ASC 718), which revised the fair value based method of accounting for share-based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards and clarified previous guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include such items as depreciation and allowances for doubtful accounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Out-of-Period Adjustment During the year ended December31, 2012, the Company recorded additional real estate operating expenses totaling approximately $3.2 million related to the cumulative non-cash straight-line adjustment to the ground rent expense of certain ground leases that were not previously recognized on a straight-line basis. This resulted in the overstatement of real estate operating expenses by approximately $3.2 million during the year ended December31, 2012 and in the understatement of real estate operating expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately $3.2 million in previous periods. Because this adjustment was not material to the prior years consolidated financial statements and the impact of recording the adjustment in the current period is not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded the related adjustment during the year ended December31, 2012.
Reclassifications The Company has modified the presentation of expenses to operate its San Francisco and Princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in its San Francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across the Company. These expenses, which totaled approximately $8.1 million, $7.7 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were previously included in Rental Operating Expenses and are now included in General and Administrative Expenses for all periods presented.
130 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No.2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU No.2013-02). ASU No.2013-02 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. ASU No.2013-02 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2012. The Companys adoption of ASU No.2013-02 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

When completed, 535 Mission Street will consist of a 27-story, ClassA office tower with approximately 307,000 net rentable square feet of office and retail space. The property is currently under development.
On March26, 2013, a consolidated joint venture in which the Company has a 95% interest completed the acquisition of a land parcel in San Francisco, California that will support a 60-story, 1.4million square foot office tower known as Transbay Tower. The purchase price for the land was approximately $192.0 million. On February7, 2013, the partner in the joint venture issued a notice that it was electing under the joint venture agreement to reduce its nominal ownership interest in the venture from 50% to 5%. On February26, 2013, the Company issued a notice to the partner electing to proceed with the venture on that basis. As a result, the Company has a 95% nominal interest in and is consolidating the joint venture (See Note 11). The initial phase of the development consisting of building the project to grade is currently under development.
On March29, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of a parcel of land located in Reston, Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $27.0 million. The land parcel is commercially zoned for 250,000 square feet of office space.
On April10, 2013, the Company acquired the Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park properties from Boston Properties Office Value-Added Fund, L.P. (the Value-Added Fund) 131 Table of Contents for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately $233.1 million. Mountain View Research Park is a 16-building complex of Office/Technical properties aggregating approximately 604,000 net rentable square feet. Mountain View Technology Park is a seven-building complex of Office/Technical properties aggregating approximately 135,000 net rentable square feet. The following table summarizes the allocation of the aggregate purchase price of Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park at the date of acquisition (in thousands) in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 Business Combinations.

The Company has eliminated in consolidation its member loan totaling $270.0 million and its share of the related accrued interest payable of approximately $114.5 million at December31, 2013. The remaining notes payable to the outside joint venture partners and related accrued interest payable totaling $180.0 million and approximately $76.4 million as of December31, 2013 have been reflected as Outside Members Notes Payable and within Accrued Interest Payable, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (See Note 3). The related interest expense from the Outside Members Notes Payable totaling approximately $16.0 million for the period from May31, 2013 through December31, 2013 is fully allocated to the outside joint venture partners as an adjustment to Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Four mortgage loans totaling approximately $2.2 billion at December31, 2013 and five mortgage loans totaling approximately $951.5 million at December31, 2012 have been accounted for at their fair values on the dates the mortgage loans were assumed. The impact of recording the mortgage loans at fair value resulted in a decrease to interest expense of approximately $34.4 million, $7.0 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The cumulative liability related to the fair value adjustments was $191.2 million and $38.6 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in mortgage notes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1)a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2)a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3)an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4)an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt. At December31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.
On April11, 2013, the Companys Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% senior unsecured notes due 2023. The notes were priced at 99.379% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of 3.279% to maturity. The notes will mature on September1, 2023, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $492.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.
On June27, 2013, the Companys Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% senior unsecured notes due 2024. The notes were priced at 99.694% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of 3.916% to maturity. The notes will mature on February1, 2024, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $691.9 million after deducting the underwriting discount and transaction expenses.

(2) The initial exchange rate is 8.5051 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (or an initial exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of Boston Properties, Inc.s common stock). In addition, the Company entered into capped call transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, which are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future exchange of the notes. The capped call transactions were intended to increase the effective exchange price to the Company of the notes from $117.58 to approximately $137.17 per share (subject to adjustments), representing an overall effective premium of approximately 40% over the closing price on August13, 2008 of $97.98 per share of Boston Properties, Inc.s common stock. The net cost of the capped call transactions was approximately $44.4 million. In connection with the special dividend declared on November27, 2013, the exchange rate of 8.5051 was adjusted to 8.6974 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December31, 2013, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $114.98 per share of Boston Properties, Inc.s common stock. As of December31, 2013, the effective exchange price was $130.21 per share. The Operating Partnership repaid the notes on February18, 2014 (See Note 20).
ASC 470-20 requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. ASC 470-20 requires that the initial proceeds from the sale of the Operating Partnerships $862.5 million of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 (all of which had been redeemed/repurchased as of December31, 2012), $450.0 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 (all of which have been redeemed/repurchased as of December31, 2013) and $747.5 million of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014 (see Note 20) be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt that could have been issued by the Operating Partnership at such time. The Company measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2.875%, 3.75% and 3.625% exchangeable senior notes for the periods presented based on effective interest rates of 5.630%, 5.958% and 6.555%, respectively. The aggregate carrying amount of the debt component was approximately $744.9 million and $1.17billion (net of the equity component allocation adjustment of approximately $2.4 million and $25.5 million) at December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, respectively. As a result, the Company attributed an aggregate of approximately $230.3 million of the proceeds to the equity component of the notes, which represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the notes at the date of issuance. The equity component of the notes has been reflected within Additional Paid-in Capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company reclassified approximately $1.0 million of deferred financing costs to Additional Paid-in Capital, which represented the costs attributable to the equity components of the notes. The carrying amount of the equity component was approximately $91.9 million and $148.5 million at December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, respectively. The resulting debt discount has been amortized over 143 Table of Contents the period during which the debt was expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption dates or, in the case of the 2014 notes, the maturity date) as additional non-cash interest expense. The aggregate contractual interest expense was approximately $34.8 million, $48.4 million and $66.3 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As a result, the Company reported additional non-cash interest expense of approximately $23.1 million, $29.1 million and $38.8 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
On April15, 2013, the Company announced that holders of its Operating Partnerships 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2036 (the Notes) had the right to surrender their Notes for purchase by the Operating Partnership (the Put Right) on May18, 2013. On April15, 2013, the Company also announced that the Operating Partnership issued a notice of redemption to the holders of the Notes to redeem, on May18, 2013 (the Redemption Date), all of the Notes outstanding on the Redemption Date. In connection with the notice of redemption, holders of the Notes had the right to exchange their Notes on or prior to May16, 2013. Notes with respect to which the Put Right was not exercised and that were not surrendered for exchange on or prior to May16, 2013, were redeemed by the Operating Partnership at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. Based on final information provided to the Operating Partnership by the trustee for the Notes, no Notes were validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Put Right. Pursuant to the notice of redemption, an aggregate principal amount of $990,000 of the Notes was redeemed on May18, 2013. The remaining aggregate principal amount of $449,010,000 of the Notes was surrendered for exchange and, in addition to the repayment of the principal in cash, the Company issued an aggregate of 419,116 shares of its common stock in exchange for the Notes (See Note 12). The Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.1 million consisting of transaction costs.
9. Unsecured Line of Credit On July26, 2013, the Companys Operating Partnership amended and restated the revolving credit agreement governing the Companys Unsecured Line of Credit, which, among other things, (1)increased the total commitment from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion, (2)extended the maturity date from June24, 2014 to July26, 2018 and (3)reduced the per annum variable interest rates and other fees. The Operating Partnership may increase the total commitment to $1.5 billion, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. At the Operating Partnerships option, loans outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1), in the case of loans denominated in Dollars, Euro or Sterling, LIBOR or, in the case of loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, CDOR, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.925% to 1.70% based on the Operating Partnerships credit rating or (2)an alternate base rate equal to the greatest of (a)the Administrative Agents prime rate, (b)the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% or (c)LIBOR for a one month period plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.70% based on the Operating Partnerships credit rating. The Unsecured Line of Credit also contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Operating Partnership at a reduced interest rate. In addition, the Operating Partnership is also obligated to pay (1)in quarterly installments a facility fee on the total commitment at a rate per annum ranging from 0.125% to 0.35% based on the Operating Partnerships credit rating and (2)an annual fee on the undrawn amount of each letter of credit equal to the LIBOR margin. Based on the Operating Partnerships current credit rating, the LIBOR and CDOR margin is 1.00%, the alternate base rate margin is 0.0% and the facility fee is 0.15%. At December31, 2013 and 2012, there were no amounts outstanding on the Unsecured Line of Credit.
The terms of the Unsecured Line of Credit require that the Company maintain a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: (1)a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, theleverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that itis reduced back to 60% within one year, (2)a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%, (3)a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40, (4)an unsecured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, the unsecured debt leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that itis reduced back to 60% within one year, (5)an unsecured debt interest coverage 144 Table of Contents ratio of at least 1.75 and (6)limitations on permitted investments. At December31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with each of these financial and other covenant requirements.
10. Commitments and Contingencies General In the normal course of business, the Company guarantees its performance of services or indemnifies third parties against its negligence. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company guarantees to certain tenants the obligations of its subsidiaries for the payment of tenant improvement allowances and brokerage commissions in connection with their leases and limited costs arising from delays in delivery of their premises.
The Company has letter of credit and performance obligations of approximately $13.9 million related to lender and development requirements.
Certain of the Companys joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of the property or its interest in the joint ventures. Under these provisions, the Company is not compelled to purchase the interest of its outside joint venture partners. See also Noncontrolling InterestRedeemable Interest in Property Partnership in Note 11.
In connection with the assumption of 767 Fifth Avenues (the General Motors Building) secured loan by the Companys consolidated joint venture, 767 Venture, LLC, the Company guaranteed the consolidated joint ventures obligation to fund various escrows, including tenant improvements, taxes and insurance in lieu of cash deposits. As of December31, 2013, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $24.1 million. The Company earns a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and has an agreement with the outside partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee.
In connection with the mortgage financing collateralized by the Companys John Hancock Tower property located in Boston, Massachusetts, the Company has agreed to guarantee approximately $15.9 million related to its obligation to provide funds for certain tenant re-leasing costs. The mortgage financing matures on January6,2017.
From time to time, the Company (or the applicable joint venture) has also agreed to guarantee portions of the principal, interest or other amounts in connection with other unconsolidated joint venture borrowings. In addition to the financial guarantees referenced above, the Company has agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of its unconsolidated joint venture loans.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Management of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of tenants and may require tenants to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees and/or other financial guarantees. Although the Companys properties are geographically diverse and the tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of rental revenue from any single tenant, the inability of that tenant to make its lease payments could have an adverse effect on the Company.
Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
The Company carries insurance coverage on its properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that it believes are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September11, 2001, the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA) was enacted in November 2002 to require regulated insurers to make 145 Table of Contents available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). The expiration date of TRIA was extended to December31, 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA) and the Company can provide no assurance that it will be extended further. Currently, the Companys property insurance program per occurrence limits are $1.0 billion for its portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism certified under TRIA other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism (Terrorism Coverage). The Company also carries $250 million of Terrorism Coverage for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York (601 Lexington Avenue) in excess of the $1.0 billion of coverage in the Companys property insurance program which is provided by IXP, LLC (IXP) as a direct insurer. Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York (767 Fifth Avenue), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are $1.625 billion, including Terrorism Coverage, with $1.375 billion of Terrorism Coverage in excess of $250 million being provided by NYXP, LLC (NYXP), as a direct insurer. The Company also currently carries nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under TRIA (NBCR Coverage), which is provided by IXP as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which the Company manages. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $1.0 billion. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the additional Terrorism Coverage provided by IXP for 601 Lexington Avenue, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP and the Terrorism Coverage provided by NYXP are backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is $100.0 million and the coinsurance is 15%. Under TRIPRA, if the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIPRA. The Company may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason. In the event TRIPRA is not extended beyond December31, 2014, (i)the Company will evaluate alternative approaches to secure coverage for acts of terrorism thereby potentially increasing its overall cost of insurance, (ii)if such insurance is not available at commercially reasonable rates with limits equal to its current coverage or at all, the Company may not continue to have full occurrence limit coverage for acts of terrorism, (iii)the Company may not satisfy the insurance requirements under existing or future debt financings secured by individual properties, (iv)the Company may not be able to obtain future debt financings secured by individual properties and (v)the Company may cancel the insurance policies issued by IXP for the NBCR Coverage and the additional Terrorism Coverage for 601 Lexington Avenue and by NYXP for the Terrorism Coverage for 767 Fifth Avenue. The Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain terrorism insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.
The Company also currently carries earthquake insurance on its properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that the Company believes are commercially reasonable. In addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its San Francisco region (excluding 535 Mission Street and the below grade improvements for Transbay Tower) with a $120 million per occurrence limit and a $120 million annual aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer. The builders risk policy maintained for the development of 535 Mission Street in San Francisco includes a $15 million per occurrence and annual aggregate limit of earthquake coverage. In addition, the builders risk policy maintained for the development of the below grade improvements of the Transbay Tower in San Francisco includes a $15million per occurrence and annual aggregate limit of earthquake coverage. The amount of the Companys earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact the Companys ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. The Company may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of its earthquake insurance program on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the Companys estimation of the value of the coverage.
146 Table of Contents IXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Companys earthquake insurance coverage for its Greater San Francisco properties, the additional Terrorism Coverage for 601 Lexington Avenue and the Companys NBCR Coverage. The additional Terrorism Coverage provided by IXP for 601 Lexington Avenue only applies to losses which exceed the program trigger under TRIA. NYXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Companys Terrorism Coverage for 767 Fifth Avenue. Currently, NYXP only insures losses which exceed the program trigger under TRIA and NYXP reinsures with a third-party insurance company any coinsurance payable under TRIA. Insofar as the Company owns IXP and NYXP, it is responsible for their liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP and NYXP are part of the Companys consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by the Companys NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP and NYXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and their insurance policies are maintained after the payout by the Federal Government. If the Company experiences a loss and IXP or NYXP are required to pay under their insurance policies, the Company would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP and NYXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. In addition, the Operating Partnership has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of $20.0 million.
The mortgages on the Companys properties typically contain requirements concerning the financial ratings of the insurers who provide policies covering the property. The Company provides the lenders on a regular basis with the identity of the insurance companies in the Companys insurance programs. The ratings of some of the Companys insurers are below the rating requirements in some of the Companys loan agreements and the lenders for these loans could attempt to claim that an event of default has occurred under the loan. The Company believes it could obtain insurance with insurers which satisfy the rating requirements. Additionally, in the future, the Companys ability to obtain debt financing secured by individual properties, or the terms of such financing, may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist on ratings for insurers or amounts of insurance which are difficult to obtain or which result in a commercially unreasonable premium. There can be no assurance that a deficiency in the financial ratings of one or more of the Companys insurers will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and California earthquake risk in particular, but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which the Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Companys business and financial condition and results of operations.
Legal Matters The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
147 Table of Contents State and Local Tax Matters Because the Company is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which the Company owns real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although the Company believes that it has substantial arguments in favor of its positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.
Environmental Matters It is the Companys policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with the Companys acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the Company is not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to its properties that the Company believes would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at the Companys properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.
In February 1999, the Company (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. The Company developed an office park on the property. The Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1)bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to the Companys ownership, (2)continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3)indemnify the Company for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.
Environmental investigations at some of the Companys properties and certain properties owned by affiliates of the Company have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case the Company engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. The Company also believes that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although the Company believes that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, the Company will take such further response actions (if any) that it deems necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
Some of the Companys properties and certain properties owned by the Companys affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, 148 Table of Contents construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is the Companys practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. The Company then uses this information as part of its decision- making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, the Company owns a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. The Company has developed an office park on this property. Prior to and during redevelopment activities, the Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.
The Company expects that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, the Company cannot assure you that it has identified all environmental liabilities at its properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at the Companys properties or that the Company will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.
Tax Protection Obligations In connection with the acquisition or contribution of three properties, the Company entered into agreements for the benefit of the selling or contributing parties which specifically state that until such time as the contributors do not hold at least a specified percentage of the OP Units owned by such person following the contribution of the properties, or until June9, 2017 for 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building), the Operating Partnership will not sell or otherwise transfer the properties in a taxable transaction. If the Company does sell or transfer the properties in a taxable transaction, it would be liable to the contributors for contractual damages.
11. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests relate to the interests in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company and interests in consolidated property partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company.

152 Table of Contents Noncontrolling InterestProperty Partnerships The noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity interests in ventures that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entities that own the properties. The equity interests in these ventures that are not owned by the Company, totaling approximately $726.1 million at December31, 2013 and approximately $(2.0) million at December31, 2012, are included in Noncontrolling InterestsProperty Partnerships on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
On February7, 2013, the partner in the Companys Transbay Tower joint venture issued a notice that it was electing under the joint venture agreement to reduce its nominal ownership interest in the venture from 50% to 5%. On February26, 2013, the Company issued a notice to the partner electing to proceed with the venture on that basis. As a result, the Company has a 95% nominal interest in and is consolidating the joint venture. Under the joint venture agreement, ifcertain return thresholds are achieved the partner will be entitled to an additional promoted interest. Also, under the agreement, (1)the partner has the right to cause the Company to purchase the partnersinterest after the defined stabilization date and (2)the Company has the right to acquire the partners interest on the third anniversary of the stabilization date, in each case at an agreed upon purchase price or appraised value. On March26, 2013, the consolidated joint venture completed the acquisition of a land parcel in San Francisco, California which will support a 60-story, 1.4million square foot office tower known as Transbay Tower. The purchase price for the land was approximately $192.0 million.

On May31, 2013, the Companys two joint venture partners in 767 Venture, LLC (the entity that owns 767 Fifth Avenue(the General Motors Building) in New York City) transferred all of their interests in the joint venture to third parties. In connection with the transfer, the Company and its new joint venture partners modified the Companys relative decision making authority and consent rights with respect to the joint ventures assets and operations. These changes resulted in the Company having sufficient financial and operating control over 767 Venture, LLC such that the Company now accounts for the assets, liabilities and operations of 767 Venture, LLC on a consolidated basis in its financial statements instead of under the equity method of accounting. Upon consolidation, the Company recognized the new joint venture partners aggregate 40% equity interest at its aggregate fair value of approximately $480.9 million within Noncontrolling InterestsProperty Partnerships on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (See Notes 3 and 5).
On October9, 2013, the Company completed the sale of a 45% ownership interest in its Times Square Tower property for a gross sale price of $684.0 million in cash.

Times Square Tower is an approximately 1,246,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office tower located in New York City. The transaction did not qualify as a sale of real estate for financial reporting purposes because the Company continues to control the joint venture and will therefore continue to account for the entity on a consolidated basis in its financial statements. The Company has accounted for the transaction as an equity transaction and has recognized noncontrolling interest in its consolidated balance sheets totaling approximately $243.5 million, which is equal to 45% of the carrying value of the total equity of the property immediately prior to the transaction. The difference between the net cash proceeds received and the noncontrolling interest recognized, which difference totals approximately $429.6 million, has not been reflected as a gain on sale of real estate in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and has instead been reflected as an increase to Additional Paid-in Capital in the Companys consolidated balance sheets (See Notes 3).

14. Segment Information The Companys segments are based on the Companys method of internal reporting which classifies its operations by both geographic area and property type. The Companys segments by geographic area are Boston, New York, Princeton, San Francisco and Washington, DC. Segments by property type include: ClassA Office, Office/Technical, Residential and Hotel.
Asset information by segment is not reported because the Company does not use this measure to assess performance. Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments. Interest and other income, development and management services, general and administrative expenses, transaction costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains (losses) from investments in securities, gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, gains on consolidation of joint ventures, impairment loss, discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests are not included in Net Operating Income as internal reporting addresses these items on a corporate level.
Net Operating Income is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. All companies may not calculate Net Operating Income in the same manner. The Company considers Net Operating Income to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of the Companys properties.
We have modified the presentation of expenses to operate our San Francisco and Princeton regional offices to reflect the growing activity in our San Francisco region and to have a consistent presentation across our company. For San Francisco these expenses, which totaled approximately $6.7 million, $6.1 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and for Princeton these expenses were approximately $1.4 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were previously included in Rental Operating Expenses and are now included in General and Administrative Expenses for all periods presented.

Earnings Per Share The following table provides a reconciliation of both the net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and the number of common shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share (EPS), which is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The terms of the Series Two Preferred Units enable the holders to obtain OP Units of the Operating Partnership, as well as Common Stock of the Company, and as a result these are considered participating securities. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are also participating securities. As such, unvested restricted common stock of the Company, LTIP Units, OPP Units and 2013 MYLTIP Units are considered participating securities. Participating securities are included in the computation of basic EPS of the Company using the two-class method. Participating securities are included in the computation of diluted EPS of the Company using the if-converted method if the impact is dilutive. Because the OPP Units and 2013 MYLTIP Units require the Company to outperform absolute and relative return thresholds, unless such thresholds have been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, the Company excludes such units from the diluted EPS calculation. Other potentially dilutive common shares, including stock options, restricted stock and other securities of the Operating Partnership that are exchangeable for the Companys Common Stock, and the related impact on earnings, are considered when calculating diluted EPS.

Employee Benefit Plans Effective January1, 1985, the predecessor of the Company adopted a 401(k) Savings Plan (the Plan) for its employees. Under the Plan, as amended, employees, as defined, are eligible to participate in the Plan after they have completed three months of service. Upon formation, the Company adopted the Plan and the terms of the Plan.
Effective January1, 2000, the Company amended the Plan by increasing the Companys matching contribution to 200% of the first 3% from 200% of the first 2% of participants eligible earnings contributed (utilizing earnings that are not in excess of an amount established by the IRS ($255,000, $250,000 and $245,000 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively), indexed for inflation) and by eliminating the vesting requirement. The Companys aggregate matching contribution for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $3.4million, $3.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
Effective January1, 2001, the Company amended the Plan to provide a supplemental retirement contribution to certain employees who have at least ten years of service on January1, 2001, and who are 40 years of age or older as of January1, 2001. The maximum supplemental retirement contribution will not exceed the annual limit on contributions established by the IRS. The Company will record an annual supplemental retirement credit for the benefit of each participant. The Companys supplemental retirement contribution and credit for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $60,000, $78,000 and $62,000, respectively.
The Company also maintains a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow officers of the Company to defer a portion of their current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals. The Companys obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had maintained approximately $16.6 million and $12.2 million, respectively, in a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. The Companys liability under the plan is equal to the total amount of compensation deferred by the plan participants and earnings on the deferred compensation pursuant to investments elected by the plan participants. The Companys liability as of December31, 2013 and 2012 was $16.6 million and $12.2million, respectively, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
17. Stock Option and Incentive Plan At the Companys 2012 annual meeting of stockholders held on May15, 2012, the stockholders of the Company approved the Boston Properties, Inc. 2012 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan). The 2012 Plan replaced the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 1997 Plan). The material terms of the 2012 Plan include, among other things: (1)the maximum number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2012 Plan is the sum of (i)13,000,000 newly authorized shares, plus (ii)the number of 159 Table of Contents shares available for grant under the 1997 Stock Plan immediately prior to the effective date of the 2012 Plan, plus (iii)any shares underlying grants under the 1997 Plan that are forfeited, cancelled or terminated (other than by exercise) in the future; (2)full-value awards (i.e., awards other than stock options) are multiplied by a 2.32 conversion ratio to calculate the number of shares available under the 2012 Plan that are used for each full-value award, as opposed to a 1.0 conversion ratio for each stock option awarded under the 2012 Plan; (3)shares tendered or held back for taxes will not be added back to the reserved pool under the 2012 Plan; (4)stock options may not be re-priced without stockholder approval; and (5)the term of the 2012 Plan is for ten years from the date of stockholder approval.
On January28, 2013, the Companys Compensation Committee approved multi-year long-term incentive program (MYLTIP) awards under the Companys 2012 Plan to officers and employees of the Company. MYLTIP awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three-year measurement period, on an annualized, compounded basis, as the performance metric. Earned awards will be based on the Companys TRS relative to (i)the Cohen& Steers Realty Majors Portfolio Index (50% weight) and (ii)the NAREIT Office Index adjusted to exclude the Company (50% weight). Earned awards will range from zero to a maximum of approximately $30.7 million depending on the Companys TRS relative to the two indices, with four tiers (threshold: approximately $5.1 million; target: approximately $10.2 million; high: approximately $20.5 million; exceptional: approximately $30.7 million) and linear interpolation between tiers. Earned awards measured on the basis of relative TRS performance are subject to an absolute TRS component in the form of relatively simple modifiers that (A)reduce the level of earned awards in the event the Companys annualized TRS is less than 2% and (B)cause some awards to be earned in the event the Companys annualized TRS is more than 10% even though on a relative basis alone the Companys TRS would not result in any earned awards.
Earned awards (if any) will vest 25% on February4, 2016, 25% on February4, 2017 and 50% on February4, 2018, based on continued employment. Vesting will be accelerated in the event of a change in control, termination of employment by the Company without cause, termination of employment by the award recipient for good reason, death, disability or retirement. If there is a change of control prior to February4, 2016, earned awards will be calculated based on TRS performance up to the date of the change of control. MYLTIP awards are in the form of LTIP Units issued on the grant date which (i)are subject to forfeiture to the extent awards are not earned and (ii)prior to the performance measurement date are only entitled to one-tenth (10%)of the regular quarterly distributions payable on common partnership units.
On March11, 2013, the Company announced that Owen D. Thomas would succeed Mortimer B. Zuckerman as the Companys Chief Executive Officer, effective April2, 2013. On April2, 2013, the Company issued 24,231 LTIP units, 38,926 2013 MYLTIP Units and 50,847 non-qualified stock options under the 2012 Plan to Mr.Thomas, pursuant to his employment agreement. Mr.Zuckerman will continue to serve as Executive Chairman for a transition period and thereafter is expected to continue to serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.In connection with succession planning, the Company and Mr.Zuckerman entered into a Transition Benefits Agreement. If Mr.Zuckerman remains employed by the Company through July1, 2014, he will be entitled to receive on January1, 2015 a lump sum cash payment of $6.7 million and an equity award with a targeted value of approximately $11.1 million. The cash payment and equity award vest one-third on each of March10, 2013,October1, 2013 and July1, 2014, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. As a result, the Company recognized approximately $13.8 million of compensation expense during the year ended December31, 2013. In addition, the agreement provides that if Mr.Zuckerman terminates his employment with the Company for any reason, voluntarily or involuntarily, he will become fully vested in any outstanding equity awards with time-based vesting. As a result, during the year ended December31, 2013, the Company accelerated the remaining approximately $12.9 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with Mr.Zuckermans unvested long-term equity awards.
Under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation the MYLTIP awards granted to employees in February 2013 and granted to Mr.Thomas in April 2013 have an aggregate value of approximately $9.2 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period under the graded vesting method.
160 Table of Contents The Company issued 36,730, 20,756 and 19,030 shares of restricted common stock and 184,733, 174,650 and 190,067 LTIP Units to employees and non-employee directors under the 1997 Plan and 2012 Plan during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The Company issued 252,220, 186,007 and 146,844 non-qualified stock options under the 1997 Plan during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The amounts issued during 2013 include the amounts issued to Mr.Thomas pursuant to his employment agreement, as discussed above. The Company issued 400,000 2011 OPP Units to employees under the 1997 Plan during the year ended December31, 2011. The Company issued 400,000 2012 OPP Units to employees under the 1997 Plan during the year ended December31, 2012. The Company issued 318,926 2013 MYLTIP Units to employees under the 2012 Plan during the year ended December31, 2013, including the amounts issued to Mr.Thomas pursuant to his employment agreement, as discussed above. Employees and directors paid $0.01 per share of restricted common stock and $0.25 per LTIP Unit, OPP Unit and 2013 MYLTIP Unit. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted stock in the Company. The aggregate value of the LTIP Units is included in noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Grants of restricted stock and LTIP Units to employees vest in four equal annual installments. Restricted stock is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted, as adjusted for forfeitures, and the closing price of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. Non-qualified stock options, which are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, are recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. As the 2011 OPP Awards, 2012 OPP Awards and 2013 MYLTIP Awards are subject to both a service condition and a market condition, the Company recognizes the compensation expense related to the 2011 OPP Awards, 2012 OPP Awards and 2013 MYLTIP Awards under the graded vesting attribution method. Under the graded vesting attribution method, each portion of the award that vests at a different date is accounted for as a separate award and recognized over the period appropriate to that portion so that the compensation cost for each portion should be recognized in full by the time that portion vests. Dividends paid on both vested and unvested shares of restricted stock are charged directly to Dividends in Excess of Earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Aggregate stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock, non-qualified stock options, LTIP Units, 2011 OPP Units, 2012 OPP Units and 2013 MYLTIP Units was approximately $43.9 million, $28.3 million and $28.3 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2013, stock-based compensation expense includes approximately $21.5 million consisting of the acceleration of the expense of the Companys Executive Chairmans stock-based compensation awards and the stock-based compensation awards associated with his transition benefits agreement related to the Companys succession planning. For the year ended December31, 2012, stock-based compensation expense includes approximately $2.7 million consisting of the acceleration of vesting of the Companys Chief Operating Officers stock-based compensation awards associated with his resignation. Upon the conclusion of the three-year measurement period in February 2011, the 2008 OPP Awards were not earned, the program was terminated and the Company accelerated the then remaining unrecognized compensation expense totaling approximately $4.3 million during the year ended December31, 2011. At December31, 2013, there was $17.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and LTIP Units and $11.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2011 OPP Units, 2012 OPP Units and 2013 MYLTIP Units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years (See Note 20).
The shares of restricted stock were valued at approximately $3.9 million ($105.30 per share weighted-average), $2.2 million ($107.31 per share weighted-average) and $1.8 million ($93.40 per share weighted-average) for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
LTIP Units were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation method model in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 CompensationStock Compensation (ASC 718). LTIP Units issued during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were valued at approximately $17.8 million, $17.3 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The weighted-average per unit fair value of LTIP Unit grants in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $96.13, $98.83 and $86.74, respectively. The per unit fair value of each LTIP Unit granted in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions; an expected life of 5.7 years, 5.8 years and 161 Table of Contents 5.8years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.03%, 0.94% and 2.22% and an expected price volatility of 26.0%, 29.1% and 30.0%, respectively.
The non-qualified stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 had a weighted-average fair value on the date of grant of $18.46, $19.50 and $24.67 per option, respectively, which was computed using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model utilizing the following assumptions: an expected life of 6.0 years, 5.4 years and 6.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.11%, 0.92% and 2.37%, an expected price volatility of 26.0%, 28.4% and 35.0% and an expected dividend yield of 3.0%, 2.9% and 3.0%, respectively. The exercise price of the options granted during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 where $105.10, $107.23 and $92.71, respectively, which was the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant.

Ritcheys brother was paid aggregate leasing commissions of approximately $868,000, $1,306,000 and $671,000 for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to certain exclusive leasing arrangements for certain Northern Virginia properties. Mr.Ritchey is an Executive Vice President of Boston Properties, Inc.
On June30, 1998, the Company acquired from entities controlled by Mr.AlanB. Landis, a former director, a portfolio of properties known as the Carnegie Center Portfolio and Tower Center One and related operations and development rights (collectively, the Carnegie Center Portfolio). In connection with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, the Operating Partnership entered into a development agreement (the Development Agreement) with affiliates of Mr.Landis providing for up to approximately 2,000,000 square feet of development in or adjacent to the Carnegie Center office complex. An affiliate of Mr.Landis was entitled to a purchase price for each parcel developed under the Development Agreement calculated on the basis of $20 per rentable square foot of property developed. Another affiliate of Mr.Landis was eligible to earn a contingent payment for each developed property that achieves a stabilized return in excess of a target annual return ranging between 10.5% and 11%. The Development Agreement also provided that upon negotiated terms and conditions, the Company and Mr.Landis would form a development company to provide development services for these development projects and would share the expenses and profits, if any, of this new company. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, Mr.Landis became a director of the Company pursuant to an Agreement Regarding Directorship, dated as of June30, 1998, with the Company (the Directorship Agreement). Under the Directorship Agreement, the Company agreed to nominate Mr.Landis for re-election as a director at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company in a year in which his term expires, provided that specified conditions are met.
On October21, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement (the 2004 Agreement) to modify several provisions of the Development Agreement. Under the terms of the 2004 Agreement, the Operating Partnership and affiliates of Mr.Landis amended the Development Agreement to limit the rights of Mr.Landis and his affiliates to participate in the development of properties under the Development Agreement. Among other things, Mr.Landis agreed that (1)Mr.Landis and his affiliates will have no right to participate in any entity formed to acquire land parcels or the development company formed by the Operating Partnership to provide development services under the Development Agreement, (2)Mr.Landis will have no right or obligation to play a role in development activities engaged in by the development company formed by the Operating Partnership under the Development Agreement or receive compensation from the development company and (3)the affiliate of Mr.Landis will have no right to receive a contingent payment for developed properties based on stabilized returns. In exchange, the Company (together with the Operating Partnership) agreed to:  effective as of June30, 1998, pay Mr.Landis $125,000 on January1 of each year until the earlier of (A)January1, 2018, (B)the termination of the Development Agreement or (C)the date on which all development properties under the Development Agreement have been conveyed pursuant to the Development Agreement, with $750,000, representing payments of this annual amount from 1998 to 2004, being paid upon execution of the 2004 Agreement; and  pay an affiliate of Mr.Landis, in connection with the development of land parcels acquired under the Development Agreement, an aggregate fixed amount of $10.50 per rentable square foot of property developed (with a portion of this amount (i.e., $5.50) being subject to adjustment, in specified circumstances, based on future increases in the Consumer Price Index) in lieu of a contingent payment 163 Table of Contents based on stabilized returns, which payment could have been greater or less than $10.50 per rentable square foot of property developed.
The Operating Partnership also continues to be obligated to pay an affiliate of Mr.Landis the purchase price of $20 per rentable square foot of property developed for each land parcel acquired as provided in the original Development Agreement. During the 20-year term of the Development Agreement, until such time, if any, as the Operating Partnership elects to acquire a land parcel, an affiliate of Mr.Landis will remain responsible for all carrying costs associated with such land parcel. On July24, 2007, the Company acquired from Mr.Landis 701Carnegie Center, a land parcel located in Princeton, New Jersey for a purchase price of approximately $3.1million.
In addition, in connection with entering into the 2004 Agreement, Mr.Landis resigned as a director of the Company effective as of May11, 2005 and agreed that the Company had no future obligation to nominate Mr.Landis as a director of the Company under the Directorship Agreement or otherwise. Mr.Landis did not resign because of a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices. Mitchell S. Landis, the Senior Vice President and Regional Manager of the Companys Princeton, New Jersey region, is the brother of Alan B. Landis.
In accordance with the Companys 2012 Plan, and as approved by the Board of Directors, six non-employee directors made an election to receive deferred stock units in lieu of cash fees for 2013. The deferred stock units will be settled in shares of common stock upon the cessation of such directors service on the Board of Directors. As a result of these elections, the aggregate cash fees otherwise payable to a non-employee director during a fiscal quarter are converted into a number of deferred stock units equal to the aggregate cash fees divided by the last reported sales price of a share of the Companys common stock on the last trading of the applicable fiscal quarter. The deferred stock units are also credited with dividend equivalents as dividends are paid by the Company. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had outstanding 83,995 and 76,682 deferred stock units, respectively.

Subsequent Events On January27, 2014, the Companys Compensation Committee approved the 2014 multi-year, long-term incentive program (the 2014 MYLTIP) awards under the Companys 2012 Plan to certain officers and employees of the Company. The 2014 MYLTIP awards utilize TRS over a three-year measurement period, on an annualized, compounded basis, as the performance metric. Earned awards will be based on the Companys TRS relative to (i)the Cohen& Steers Realty Majors Portfolio Index (50% weight) and (ii)the NAREIT Office Index adjusted to exclude the Company (50% weight). Earned awards will range from zero to a maximum of approximately $40.2 million depending on the Companys TRS relative to the two indices, with four tiers (threshold: approximately $6.7 million; target: approximately $13.4 million; high: approximately $26.8 million; exceptional: approximately $40.2 million) and linear interpolation between tiers. Earned awards measured on the basis of relative TRS performance are subject to an absolute TRS component in the form of relatively simple modifiers that (A)reduce the level of earned awards in the event the Companys annualized TRS is less than 0% and (B)cause some awards to be earned in the event the Companys annualized TRS is more than 12% even though on a relative basis alone the Companys TRS would not result in any earned awards.
Earned awards (if any) will vest 50% on February3, 2017 and 50% on February3, 2018, based on continued employment. Vesting will be accelerated in the event of a change in control, termination of employment by the Company without cause, termination of employment by the award recipient for good reason, death, disability or retirement. If there is a change of control prior to February3, 2017, earned awards will be calculated based on TRS performance up to the date of the change of control. The 2014 MYLTIP awards are in the form of LTIP Units issued on the grant date which (i)are subject to forfeiture to the extent awards are not earned and (ii)prior to the performance measurement date are only entitled to one-tenth (10%)of the regular quarterly distributions payable on common partnership units.
Under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation the 2014 MYLTIP awards have an aggregate value of approximately $13.1 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the four-year plan period under the graded vesting method.
On January31, 2014, the Company issued 21,455 shares of restricted common stock and 109,718 LTIP units under the 2012 Plan to certain employees of the Company.
On January31, 2014, the measurement period for the Companys 2011 OPP Awards expired and the Companys TRS performance was not sufficient for employees to earn and therefore become eligible to vest in any of the 2011 OPP Awards. As a result, the Company accelerated the then remaining unrecognized compensation expense totaling approximately $1.2 million. Accordingly, all 2011 OPP Awards were automatically forfeited and the Operating Partnership repaid employees an amount equal to $0.25 (which is equal to what they paid upon acceptance of the award) multiplied by the number of 2011 OPP Awards they received.
On February10, 2014, the Company completed and fully placed in-service The Avant at Reston Town Center development project comprised of 359 apartment units and retail space aggregating approximately 355,000 square feet located in Reston, Virginia.
On February18, 2014, the Companys Operating Partnership repaid at maturity the $747.5 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2014 plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
