Business General As used herein, the terms we, us, our and the Company refer to Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1997, individually or together with its subsidiaries, including Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and our predecessors. We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, and one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five marketsBoston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiary, Boston Properties Limited Partnership.

We own or control undeveloped land totaling approximately 605.2 acres, which will support approximately 13.1million square feet of development. In addition, we have a minority interest in the Boston Properties Office Value-Added Fund, L.P., which we refer to as the Value-Added Fund, which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors through which we have pursued the acquisition of assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation.

At December31, 2007, the Value-Added Fund had investments in an office complex in San Carlos, California, and an office property in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.

The Mountain View properties were not included in our property information set forth above as of December31, 2007.
We consider ClassA office properties to be centrally-located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings.

1 Table of Contents Boston Properties Limited Partnership Boston Properties Limited Partnership, or BPLP, is a Delaware limited partnership, and the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. We are the sole general partner and, as of February22, 2008, the owner of approximately 84.0% of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by the Company as a percentage of the sum of (1)the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP, (2)the number of common partnership units issuable upon conversion of outstanding preferred partnership units of BPLP and (3)the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP, or LTIP units, other than LTIP units issued in the form of 2008 Outperformance Awards assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted common stock, although LTIP units issued in the form of 2008 Outperformance awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10 th )of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned. See 2008 Outperformance Awards on page6. Our general and limited partnership interests in BPLP entitle us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, BPLP in proportion to our percentage interest and entitle us to vote on all matters requiring a vote of the limited partners. The other limited partners of BPLP are persons who contributed their direct or indirect interests in properties to BPLP in exchange for common units or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP or recipients of LTIP units pursuant to the Second Amendment and Restatement of our 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 1997 Plan). Under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, unitholders may present their common units of BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of a unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of our common stock. In lieu of cash redemption by BPLP, however, we may elect to acquire any common units so tendered by issuing shares of our common stock in exchange for the common units. If we so elect, our common stock will be exchanged for common units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. We generally expect that we will elect to issue our common stock in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having BPLP pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, our percentage ownership in BPLP will increase. In addition, whenever we issue shares of our common stock other than to acquire common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, we must contribute any net proceeds we receive to BPLP and BPLP must issue to us an equivalent number of common units of BPLP. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT.
Preferred units of BPLP have the rights, preferences and other privileges, including the right to convert into common units of BPLP, as are set forth in an amendment to the limited partnership agreement of BPLP. As of December31, 2007 and February22, 2008, BPLP had one series of its preferred units outstanding. The Series Two preferred units have a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit (or an aggregate of approximately $55.7 million at December31, 2007 and February22, 2008). The Series Two preferred units are convertible, at the holders election, into common units at a conversion price of $38.10 per common unit (equivalent to a ratio of 1.312336 common units per Series Two preferred unit). Distributions on the Series Two preferred units are payable quarterly and, unless the greater rate described in the next sentence applies, accrue at 7.0% until May12, 2009 and 6.0% thereafter. If distributions on the number of common units into which the Series Two preferred units are convertible are greater than distributions calculated using the rates described in the preceding sentence for the applicable quarterly period, then the greater distributions are payable instead. Since May 2005, distributions have been made at the greater rate determined on the basis of distributions paid on the common units into which the Series Two preferred units are convertible. The terms of the Series Two preferred units provide that they may be redeemed for cash in six annual tranches, beginning on May12, 2009, at our election or at the election of the holders. We also have the right to convert into common units of BPLP any Series Two preferred units that are not redeemed when they are eligible for redemption.

5 Table of Contents 2008 Outperformance Awards On January24, 2008, our Compensation Committee (the Committee) of our Board approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to officers and key employees. These awards (the 2008 OPP Awards) are part of a new broad-based, long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to our outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February5, 2008 to February5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock for the five trading days prior to and including February5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8million have been allocated to date and were granted on February5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants, with OPP awards exceeding a potential reward of $1 million requiring the approval of the Committee (See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Business and Growth Strategies Business Strategy Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment so as to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return. Our strategy to achieve this objective is:  to concentrate on a few carefully selected geographic markets, including Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ, and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, owners and developers in each of those markets. We select markets and submarkets where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities;  to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the lack of available sites and the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office, research and development space as well as selected retail space;  to take on complex, technically challenging projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties which other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;  to concentrate on high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of todays tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure and support services, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients;  to opportunistically acquire assets which increase our penetration in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate and which exhibit an opportunity to improve or preserve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and re-leasing as existing leases terminate;  to explore joint venture opportunities primarily with existing owners of land parcels located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital, and/or to explore joint venture opportunities with strategic institutional partners, leveraging our skills as owners, operators and developers of ClassA office space as well as partners with expertise in mixed-use opportunities; 6 Table of Contents  to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties, including core properties, to take advantage of our value creation and the demand for our premier properties;  to seek third-party development contracts, which can be a significant source of revenue and enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and  to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital.
Growth Strategies External Growth We believe that our development experience and our organizational depth position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types, including low-rise suburban office properties, high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments and research and laboratory space, within budget and on schedule. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:  our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that will support approximately 13.1million square feet of new office, retail, hotel and residential development;  our reputation gained through 38 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;  our relationships with leading national corporations and public institutions seeking new facilities and development services;  our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry;  our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provides comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas;  our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; and  our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets.
Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories:  Development in selected submarkets.
We believe the continued development of well-positioned office buildings will be justified in many of our submarkets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 38-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential.
In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment.
7 Table of Contents Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.
Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals.
We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our relatively low leverage and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions in the current credit-constrained environment. There may be enhanced opportunities to purchase assets with near-term financing maturities or possibly provide debt on assets at enhanced yields given the limited availability of traditional sources of debt. We may acquire properties for cash, but we are also particularly well-positioned to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or our common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax-efficient basis. In addition, we may consider mergers with and acquisitions of compatible real estate firms.
Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets . We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies and a responsive property management program. We have developed this strategy and program for our existing portfolio, where we provide high-quality property management services using our own employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties. We are able to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house and third-party vendors services for marketing, including calls and presentations to prospective tenants, print advertisements, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements. Our tenants benefit from cost efficiencies produced by our experienced work force, which is attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management.
Internal Growth We believe that significant opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties because they are of high quality and in desirable locations. In addition, our properties are in markets where, in general, the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites, the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development on vacant land and the difficulty of obtaining financing. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1)to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2)to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements and (3)to work with new or existing tenants with space expansion and contraction maximizing the cash flow from our assets. We believe that our office properties will add to our internal growth because of their desirable locations and the fact that our in-place rents are currently lower than market rents. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:  Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit tenants.
In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.
8 Table of Contents We had an average lease term of 7.4 years at December31, 2007 and continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high quality, financially stable tenants. Based on leases in place at December31, 2007, leases with respect to 5.5% of the total square feet in our portfolio will expire in calendar year 2008.
Directly manage properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention.
We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations.
Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs . We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and achieve relatively high rental rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets.
Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration . We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy tenants on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships.
Policies with Respect to Certain Activities The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by our Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by our Board of Directors.
Investment Policies Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in the value of Boston Properties, Inc. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.
We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development projects and other acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our marketsBoston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants.
We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership, including third parties with expertise in mixed-use opportunities. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio.
9 Table of Contents Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).
Investments in Real Estate Mortgages While our current portfolio consists of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup its full investment. Although we currently do not have any investments in mortgages or deeds of trust, we may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in value of the property.
Securities of or Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for our REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.
Dispositions Our disposition of properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors that such action would be in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP, including Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to us. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section1031 of the Internal Revenue Code or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by the sale. Some of our assets are subject to tax protection agreements, which may limit our ability to dispose of the assets or require us to pay damages to the prior owners in the event of a taxable sale.
Financing Policies The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. However, our mortgages, credit facilities and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. We have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole.
Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and BPLP as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service.
10 Table of Contents Policies with Respect to Other Activities As the sole general partner of BPLP, we have the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. We have in the past, and may in the future, issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BPLP and we do not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Treasury Regulations), our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Energy and Natural Resource Conservation As one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States, we strive to control our energy and natural resource consumption through active management at our properties. On an annual basis, our property managers identify capital improvement projects and building systems enhancements that have the potential to reduce the use of energy at each property. The identified projects and enhancements are then reviewed with senior management, and the projects and enhancements that offer material energy or resource savings and meet our investment criteria are then implemented.
During 2007, we continued implementing numerous improvement projects and system enhancements, including, without limitation, the following:  installation of higher efficiency lighting in public spaces, garages, stairways and elevators;  installation of new, high-efficiency motors, air compressors, chillers and other heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system components;  replacing and upgrading energy management systems, including installation of carbon dioxide controls;  installation of solar reflective window film to reduce solar heat gain, glare and ultraviolet radiation, and adding wall and ceiling insulation to reduce thermal losses;  modernizing cooling towers with high-efficiency fill and distribution pans;  implementing programs to minimize waste of water and reclaim steam condensate for our cooling towers;  upgrading water treatment, plumbing and irrigation operations; and  implementing extensive recycling programs.
In addition to the physical improvements and systems enhancements described above, our property managers also benchmark building energy consumption with the goal of optimizing equipment use and operation, provide training for our property management staff and strive to make our tenants more aware of energy codes and energy saving opportunities. For example, we have worked collaboratively with our tenants at many of our buildings to implement new policies for providing HVAC on weekends only upon request. We also continue to increase the use of shuttle services between certain of our properties and the local bus and subway stations to encourage the use of mass transportation. These management initiatives are intended to not only help reduce energy consumption in the short term, but also heighten awareness of the issue to help ensure energy efficiency over the long term.
11 Table of Contents We believe our efforts described above have led to a meaningful reduction in the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) used in the operation of our properties and a reduction in our operating expenses. We estimate that the efforts we undertook in 2007 alone will reduce the amount of electrical usage throughout our portfolio by more than 2.4million kWh per year. Our efforts have also been recognized by third parties as we have achieved the Environmental Protection Agencys Energy Star  designation at several of our buildings and have earned energy conservation awards and recognition at properties located throughout our portfolio.
In addition to the efforts described above, we participate in utility rebate programs when making significant capital improvements and, when economically practicable, we subscribe to long-term, fixed utility contracts on a regional basis.
On an annual basis, we intend to continue to explore ways of reducing our energy consumption and related expenses, and conserving natural resources, across our portfolio.
Environmentally Sound Development Green buildings are designed, constructed, and operated to provide greater environmental, economic, health and productivity performance than conventional buildings. As a developer, we participate in the U.S. Green Building Councils Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. The LEED Green Building Rating System  is a voluntary, consensus-based national standard of design guidelines for high-performance, sustainable Green buildings. The USGBCs LEED certification follows a rigorous registration process which evaluates and gives Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum ratings to green buildings.
We currently have LEED registered projects under development throughout our portfolio, including the following:  250 West 55th StreetThis 1,000,000 square foot ClassA office tower in New York, NY has been pre-certified with a Gold LEED rating.
Annapolis JunctionThis 117,600 square foot ClassA office property in Annapolis, MD has been pre-certified with a Gold LEED rating.
77 CityPointThis 210,000 square foot ClassA office property in Waltham, MA has been pre-certified with a Silver LEED rating.
We also have several other development projects that have been designed to achieve LEED certification. These include Russia Wharf, an 815,000 square foot office tower in Boston, MA, and 701 Carnegie Center, a 120,000 square foot office property in Princeton, NJ. We expect to apply for official LEED pre-certification of these projects in due course. In addition, we actively seek opportunities to achieve LEED ratings on commercial interiors as tenants build-out or renovate their space. We have numerous commercial interior projects either planned or currently under construction that have been designed to achieve LEED certification, and we have already completed various projects that either already received, or we expect will receive, LEED certifications, including our new headquarters in the Prudential Center in Boston.
Many of the local jurisdictions in which we operate and develop buildings are also making efforts to promote environmentally sound developments by adopting aspects of the LEED program. As a result, we intend to continue to be proactive in evaluating each new development to determine whether it is physically practical and economically feasible to produce a LEED certified building.
12 Table of Contents Competition We compete in the leasing of office space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc.
Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
Our Hotel Property We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to leases for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease allows all the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary. In connection with these arrangements, Marriott has agreed to operate and maintain our hotel in accordance with its system-wide standard for comparable hotels and to provide the hotel with the benefits of its central reservation system and other chain-wide programs and services. Under a management agreement for the hotel, Marriott acts as the taxable REIT subsidiarys agent to supervise, direct and control the management and operation of the hotel and receives as compensation base management fees that are calculated as a percentage of the hotels gross revenues, and supplemental incentive fees if the hotel exceeds negotiated profitability breakpoints. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary compensates Marriott, on the basis of a formula applied to the hotels gross revenues, for certain system-wide services provided by Marriott, including central reservations, marketing and training. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Marriott received an aggregate of approximately $3.2 million, $4.7 million and $4.2, respectively. For the years 2006 and 2005, these amounts include payments related to Long Wharf Marriott and Residence Inn by Marriott hotel properties, as applicable.
Seasonality Our hotel property traditionally has experienced significant seasonality in its operating income, with the percentage of net operating income by quarter over the year ended December31, 2007 shown below.
First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 7% 29% 24% 40% Corporate Governance Boston Properties is currently managed by a nine member Board of Directors, which is divided into three classes (Class I, Class II and Class III).

14 Table of Contents Item1A.
Risk Factors.
Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. We refer to the shares of our common stock and the units of limited partnership interest in BPLP together as our securities, and the investors who own shares or units, or both, as our securityholders. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 40.
Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our office and hotel properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our office and hotel properties:  downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);  competition from other office, hotel and commercial buildings;  local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, hotel or other commercial space;  changes in interest rates and availability of attractive financing;  vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;  increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;  civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;  significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;  declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and  decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.
We are dependent upon the economic climates of our marketsBoston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ.
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in five markets: Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. A downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space. Because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. For example, in our Washington, D.C. market we focus on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as legal firms. In our midtown Manhattan market we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. A significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations.
15 Table of Contents Our investment in property development may be more costly than anticipated.
We intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office properties. Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:  we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;  we may incur construction costs for a development project which exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;  we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;  we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;  we may expend funds on and devote managements time to projects which we do not complete; and  we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule.
Investment returns from our developed properties may be lower than anticipated.
Our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:  we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development; and  occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.
We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.
We may develop properties, either alone or through joint ventures with other persons, that are known as mixed-use developments. This means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for other commercial purposes. We have limited experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate. As a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. If we are not able to sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate. In addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing).
We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.
We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of 16 Table of Contents the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. In addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity.There is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. This risk is currently heightened because the debt market isexperiencing volatility, including reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums. These conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future.
We have agreements with a number of limited partners of BPLP who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.
An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets.
As of February22, 2008, we had approximately $142.3 million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur more of such indebtedness in the future. Approximately $96.7 million of this variable rate debt is fixed through an interest rate swap contract at 5.82%per annum through October 2008. If interest rates increase, then so will the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. While these agreementsare intended tolessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk thatthe other parties to the agreements will not perform,wecould incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceableand theunderlying transactionswill fail toqualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.
The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. In addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.
17 Table of Contents We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. In addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock or debt securities.
On February22, 2008, we had approximately $5.5 billion in total indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis (i.e., excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt). Debt to market capitalization ratio, which measures total debt as a percentage of the aggregate of total debt plus the market value of outstanding equity securities, is often used by analysts to gauge leverage for equity REITs such as us. Our market value is calculated using the price per share of our common stock. Using the closing stock price of $88.06 per share of our common stock of Boston Properties, Inc. on February22, 2008, multiplied by the sum of (1)the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP (including common partnership units held by us), (2)the number of common partnership units available upon conversion of all outstanding preferred partnership units of BPLP and (3)the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units (other than LTIP units issued in the form of 2008 Outperformance Awards) assuming all conditions have been met for conversion of the LTIP units, our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately 31% as of February22, 2008.
Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of our stock price, or our ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.
We face risks associated with property acquisitions.
We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:  even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;  we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;  acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;  the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;  the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied; 18 Table of Contents  acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. This acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.
We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:  liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;  claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and  claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.
We plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:  we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private REITs, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and  even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.
Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
In appropriate circumstances, we intend to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. We currently have eight joint ventures that are not consolidated with our financial statements. Our share of the aggregate revenue of these joint ventures represented approximately 2.5% of our total revenue (the sum of our total consolidated revenue and our share of such joint venture revenue) for the year ended December31, 2007. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:  we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property; 19 Table of Contents  our joint venture partners may default on their obligations necessitating that we fulfill their obligation ourselves;  our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties; and  our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.
Our properties face significant competition.
We face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our tenants. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties.
We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.
We derive most of our income from rent received from our tenants. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.
We face potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. Our tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.
We may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.
Large and high-quality office and hotel properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. This may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes. Properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases. If we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs, which in turn would impact our cash flow and increase our leverage. In some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax 20 Table of Contents protection agreements with contributors. To dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants).
Because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.
Because the lease payments we receive under our hotel lease is based on a participation in the gross receipts of the hotel, if the hotel does not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would be decreased, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property:  our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;  if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;  our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and  our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism.
In addition, because our hotel property is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is subject to the Cambridge markets fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.
We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
We continue to have significant cash balances that we invest in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):  direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;  obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies;  taxable municipal securities;  obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;  commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;  repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;  both registered and unregistered money market funds; and  other highly rated short-term securities.
Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
21 Table of Contents Failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.
If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes, we will be taxed as a corporation. We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
In addition, we currently hold certain of our properties, and the Value-Added Fund holds its properties, through a subsidiary that has elected to be taxed as a REIT and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:  we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;  unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and  all dividends will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will no longer be required to pay dividends. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it would adversely affect the value of our common stock.
In order to maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
In order to maintain our REIT status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. To qualify as REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding capital gains. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. The inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise shortand long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our REIT status.
22 Table of Contents Congress has introduced legislation that, if enacted, could cause Boston Properties Limited Partnership to be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules.
Legislation was recently introduced in Congress that would treat publicly traded partnerships as corporations for federal income tax purposes if the partnership directly or indirectly derives income from certain investment adviser or asset management services. Because certain of our Operating Partnerships activities could constitute investment adviser or asset management services as defined for these purposes, unless transfers of ownership of interests in BPLP are limited in a manner that complies with certain regulatory safe harbors or another exception applies, it is possible that this legislation, if enacted, could cause BPLP to be taxable as a corporation. Classification of BPLP as a corporation would also cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Under a transitional rule contained in one version of the proposed legislation BPLP would be exempt from the new rules until its taxable year beginning January1, 2013. An alternative proposal, however, would shorten the transition period to make the new law applicable to existing publicly-traded partnerships beginning January1, 2008, and it is possible that any legislation ultimately enacted could be effective immediately, or possibly even retroactively.
Congress is also considering legislative proposals to treat all or part of certain income allocated to a partner by a partnership in respect of certain services provided to or for the benefit of the partnership (carried interest revenue) as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. While the current legislative proposal provides that such income will nevertheless retain its original character for purposes of the REIT qualification tests, it is not clear what form any such final legislation would take. Furthermore, under the proposed legislation, carried interest revenue could be treated as non- qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception to the publicly-traded partnership rules. If enacted, this could result in BPLP being taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the amount of any such carried interest revenue plus any other non-qualifying income earned by BPLP exceeds 10% of its gross income in any taxable year.
Limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Delaware corporate law, may:  delay or prevent a change of control over us or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to our stockholders; and  limit our stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.
Stock Ownership Limit To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a REIT and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of capital stock ownership, our certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our common stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. Our board of directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, under our certificate of incorporation each of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, along with their respective families and affiliates, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity common stock. Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.
23 Table of Contents BPLPs Partnership Agreement We have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of BPLP other than Boston Properties, Inc. receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1)the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of our common stock in the transaction or (2)limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of our common stock received in the transaction. If these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by Boston Properties, Inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. In addition, we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that we will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which we receive the approval of our common stockholders unless (1)limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by Boston Properties, Inc. or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2)the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction. Therefore, if our common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before we can complete the transaction:  holders of partnership interests in BPLP, including Boston Properties, Inc., must vote on the matter;  Boston Properties, Inc. must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as our stockholders voted on the transaction; and  the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.
As a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and we may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though our stockholders approve of the transaction.
Shareholder Rights Plan We have a shareholder rights plan. Under the terms of this plan, we can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock because, unless we approve of the acquisition, after the person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value. This would substantially reduce the value and influence of the stock owned by the acquiring person. Our board of directors can prevent the plan from operating by approving the transaction in advance, which gives us significant power to approve or disapprove of the efforts of a person or group to acquire a large interest in our company.
Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following:  the extent of investor interest in our securities;  the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;  our underlying asset value;  investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally; 24 Table of Contents  national economic conditions;  changes in tax laws;  our financial performance;  changes in our credit ratings; and  general stock and bond market conditions.
The market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, our common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock. If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish.
Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.
The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions, or repay indebtedness. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.
The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.
In connection with and subsequent to our initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of capital stock of Boston Properties, Inc. or partnership interests in BPLP were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. This common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. Additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. Future sales of our common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of our common stock.
We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.
Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies.
Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
We depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Edward H. Linde, our Chief Executive Officer, and Douglas T. Linde, our President. Among the reasons that Messrs. Zuckerman, E. Linde and D. Linde are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential tenants and industry personnel could diminish. Mr.Zuckerman has substantial outside business interests that could interfere with his ability to devote his full time to our business and affairs.
Our two Executive Vice Presidents and five Regional Managers also have strong reputations. Their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective tenants and industry personnel.
25 Table of Contents Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP.
Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in BPLP than on our stockholders.
Some holders of interests in BPLP, including Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde, would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to us and our stockholders. Consequently, these holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While we have exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of our Board of Directors. While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters, as directors and executive officers, Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of our stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.
Agreement not to sell some properties.
We have entered into agreements with respect to some properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. Pursuant to those agreements, we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer some of our properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income and we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. In general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered. As of December31, 2007, there were a total of 24 wholly-owned properties subject to these restrictions, and those properties are estimated to have accounted for approximately 34% of our total revenue for the year ended December31, 2007.
BPLP has also entered into agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. These agreements may hinder actions that we may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because we would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if we violate these agreements.
Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde will continue to engage in other activities.
Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde have a broad and varied range of investment interests. Either one could acquire an interest in a company which is not currently involved in real estate investment activities but which may acquire real property in the future. However, pursuant to each of their employment agreements, Messrs. Zuckerman and E. Linde will not, in general, have management control over such companies and, therefore, they may not be able to prevent one or more of such companies from engaging in activities that are in competition with our activities.
Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.
The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including office buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.
26 Table of Contents Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.
Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
We carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September11, 2001, the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA) was enacted in November 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). The expiration date of TRIA was extended to December31, 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA). Prior to TRIPRA, only acts of foreign terrorism could be certified for coverage under TRIA. Under TRIPRA, acts of both foreign and domestic terrorism can be certified for coverage under TRIA. Currently, the Companys property insurance program per occurrence limits are $900 million, including coverage for foreign acts of terrorism certified under TRIA and coverage for domestic acts of terrorism up to $500 million per occurrence, and an additional $400 million of coverage for domestic acts of terrorism on a per occurrence and annual aggregate basis. Currently, we also carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage (NBCR Coverage) for foreign acts of terrorism certified under TRIA, which is provided by IXP, LLC as a direct insurer, excluding our Value-Added Fund properties. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $900 million. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is $100 million andthe coinsurance is 10%. Under TRIPRA, if the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIPRA. We may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. We intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.
We also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that we believe are commercially reasonable. In addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our San Francisco region with a $120 million per occurrence limit and a $120 million annual aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, LLC, as a direct insurer. The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. We may discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.
In January 2002, we formed a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc., to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of our overall insurance program. On September27, 2006, IXP, Inc. was merged into IXP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, and all insurance policies issued by IXP, Inc. were cancelled and reissued by IXP, LLC. The term IXP refers to IXP, Inc. for the period prior to September27, 2006 and to IXP, LLC for the period on and subsequent to September27, 2006. IXP acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco properties and our NBCR Coverage for foreign acts of terrorism certified under TRIA. Insofar as we own IXP, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the 27 Table of Contents Federal Government. IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out under TRIA and if IXP maintains the NBCR policy after the payout by the Federal Government. If we experience a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of IXPs required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.
We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or the presence of mold at our properties, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.
Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.
We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., Boston and San Francisco. As a result, some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. See also Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
We face risks associated with our tenants being designated Prohibited Persons by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (OFAC) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (Prohibited Persons). OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons (the OFAC Requirements). Certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with OFAC Requirements. We have established a compliance program whereby tenants and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the OFAC list of Prohibited Persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. Our leases and other agreements require the other party to comply with OFAC Requirements. If a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the OFAC list we may be required by the OFAC Requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful.
Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.
Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because:  as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; 28 Table of Contents  the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination;  even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and  governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.
These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a $10 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $25 million. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination. Changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures.
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:  properly manage and maintain the asbestos;  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and  undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.
Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
Some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead in drinking water, for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem, and for contamination in groundwater. Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that:  the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities;  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and  future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.
29 Table of Contents Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. Such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the propertys tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property.
We did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during our initial public offering.
We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of our initial public offering in June 1997. Before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. We did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. However, to the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the IPO, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties. Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of our initial public offering, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. We have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after our initial public offering, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.
Because of the ownership structure of our hotel property, we face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws.
We own one hotel property. However, under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly. Accordingly, we lease our hotel property to one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. As lessor, we are entitled to a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the hotel property. Marriott International, Inc. manages the hotel under the Marriott name pursuant to a management contract with the taxable REIT subsidiary as lessee. While the taxable REIT subsidiary structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us, the taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotel at the federal and state level. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated. If the tax laws applicable to taxable REIT subsidiaries are modified, we may be forced to modify the structure for owning our hotel property, and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from our hotel. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, and we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such actions may prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the taxable REIT subsidiary and, therefore, may adversely affect our after-tax returns from our hotel property.
We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.
From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.
30 Table of Contents We face possible state and local tax audits.
Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Properties At December31, 2007, our portfolio consisted of 139 properties totaling 43.8million net rentable square feet. Our properties consisted of (1)135 office properties, comprised of 102 ClassA office buildings, including 13 properties under construction, and 20 properties that support both office and technical uses, (2)three retail properties and (3)one hotel. In addition, we own or control 605.2 acres of land for future development. The table set forth below shows information relating to the properties we owned, or in which we had an ownership interest, at December31, 2007. On January7, 2008, we transferred the Mountain View properties to the Value-Added Fund. For the year ended December31, 2007, the financial results of these properties are included in our consolidated financial results, but not included in any of our portfolio information tables or any other portfolio level statistics. Information relating to properties owned by the Value-Added Fund is not included in our portfolio information tables or any other portfolio level statistics because the Value-Added Fund invests in assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation. We therefore believe including such information in our portfolio tables and statistics would render the portfolio information less useful to investors. Information relating to the Value-Added Fund is set forth below separately.

At February22, 2008, we had approximately 1,536 stockholders of record. This does not include beneficial owners for whom Cede& Co. or others act as nominee.
In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (not including net capital gains). We have adopted a policy of paying regular quarterly distributions on our common stock, and we have adopted a policy of paying regular quarterly distributions on the common units of BPLP. Cash distributions have been paid on our common stock and BPLPs common units since our initial public offering. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on actual and anticipated cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors the Board of Directors may consider relevant.
During the three months ended December31, 2007,we issuedan aggregate of 14,633 common shares in exchange for 14,633 common units of limited partnership held by certain limited partners of BPLP. These shares were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section4(2). We relied on the exemption under Section4(2) based upon factual representations received from the limited partners who received the common shares.

FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 85.32%, 84.40%, 83.74%, 82.97% and 82.06% for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively,after allocation tothe minority interest in the Operating Partnership.
In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts.
The adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debts stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment.Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP.However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions.We believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions.
The adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the year ended December31, 2003 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No.133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No.133 on January1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts 39 Table of Contents because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment.
Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREITs definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO.
Neither FFO, nor FFO as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
A reconciliation of FFO, and FFO, as adjusted, to net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP is provided under the heading of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFunds from Operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business-Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.
Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:  general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);  failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; 40 Table of Contents  risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities);  risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and/or availability of financing;  risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements;  risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;  risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks;  costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws;  potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;  risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;  possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws;  the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results;  risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and  risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item1A- Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on Form 8-K or otherwise.
Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of ClassA office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five marketsBoston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our ClassA office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non-core assets or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors.
The impact of the current state of the economy, including rising unemployment and constrained capital, on our company is unknown. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles and, based on our current occupancy and recent 41 Table of Contents leasing success, lack of available supply in our markets and limited lease rollover, we believe we are well positioned to withstand a slowing economy. The state of the debt capital markets is continuing to deteriorate with many lenders, including CMBS providers, out of the market and others such as banks and life insurance companies tightening their credit standards and cautiously allocating capital. We believe our current liquidity, including our cash balances and the availability under our $605 million line of credit, is sufficient to meet our foreseeable capital needs and helps to insulate us from the difficulties in the capital markets. In fact, we believe that, given our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we will have opportunities to capitalize on the current environment and we intend to seek acquisitions of high-quality real estate at attractive returns.
Although we intend to pursue such acquisitions, we continue to believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be greater than those we can expect from acquisitions. Since the beginning of 2005 we have completed over $4.3 billion of asset sales and have redeployed a significant amount of the proceeds into our development pipeline. We started approximately $1.7 billion of developments in 2007, including commencing construction on our approximately 1.0million square foot office tower in New York City at 250 West 55th Street and on our 815,000 square foot mixed-use Russia Wharf development in Boston. We entered 2008 with an active development program of approximately $2.1 billion, and although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years and we currently do not have any assets on the market. We believe our focus on new development will enhance our long-term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in-service in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
Update on Recent Regulatory Initiatives On August31, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued proposed FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-a Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (the proposed FSP) that would require the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The proposed FSP, if issued as currently contemplated, would require that the initial debt proceeds from the sale of Boston Properties Limited Partnerships (BPLP) $862.5 million of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 and $450.0 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt. The resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption dates) as additional non-cash interest expense. The proposed FSP would be effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and it would be applied retrospectively to BPLPs outstanding exchangeable senior notes for all periods presented. Based on our current understanding of the application of the proposed FSP, this would result in an aggregate of approximately $18 million (net of incremental capitalized interest) of additional non-cash interest expense for fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of capitalized interest, the additional non-cash interest expense would be approximately $20 million to $22 million, and this amount (before netting) will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the first optional redemption dates as the debt accretes to its par value over the same period. There can be no assurance that the proposed FSP will be issued in the form currently contemplated by the FASB, or at all, and therefore its ultimate impact on our interest expense may differ materially from the aforementioned estimate.
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is 42 Table of Contents possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1)the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2)managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.
Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No.144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, (SFAS No.144) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.
43 Table of Contents SFAS No.144 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No.34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No.67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1)substantially completed and (2)occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary.
Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No.141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements.
44 Table of Contents Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we:  review relevant financial information, including:  financial ratios;  net worth;  debt to market capitalization; and  liquidity;  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team; and  assess the strength/growth of the tenants industry.
As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenants credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we:  require a security deposit; and/or  reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters.
We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease.
Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1-4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include:  payment history;  credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric);  change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize);  tenant financial performance;  economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and  industry specific credit considerations.
If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases was approximately 7.4years as of December31, 2007. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and frequent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 45 Table of Contents 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99-19. Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99-19.
Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.
We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest.
Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFASNo. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.
Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No.141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate.
Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
At December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 139, 131 and 121 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total 46 Table of Contents Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed-in Service.
In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.
Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), minority interest in Operating Partnership, losses from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.
Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.
Comparison of the year ended December31, 2007 to the year ended December31, 2006 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January1, 2006 and owned through December31, 2007, totaling approximately 25.5million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January1, 2006 or disposed of on or prior to December31, 2007. Properties Placed In-Service includes our 5059 th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in-service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambride Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold.

Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $37,811 and $33,014, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $27,765 and $24,966, respectively, per the Consolidated Income Statement.
48 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of approximately $7.3 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $102.9 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $40.7 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.2 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $6.8 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006.
We incur certain tenant specific property costs for which we are reimbursed from our tenants. Starting in 2007, we have included these reimbursements in rental revenue and included the tenant specific operating cost within real estate operating expenses. This income and expense classification in 2007 results in a presented increase to comparable rental revenue and real estate operating expenses, however does not impact our consolidated net operating income. For the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the rental income and real estate operating expense gross up was approximately $8.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively.
Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $39.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $7.3 million in straight-line rents. Approximately $18.8 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $3.9 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income.
The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to partially placing in-service our 505 9th Street development project in the fourth quarter of 2007, placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006.

Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December31, 2007 and December31, 2006. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service in July 2006.
The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property through agreements entered into at the time of sale. Rental Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $102.9 million, as detailed below: Date Sold RentalRevenuefortheyearendedDecember31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Democracy Center August7,2007 $ 12,016 $ 17,825 $ (5,809 ) 5 Times Square February15,2007 9,886 74,795 (64,909 ) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006  32,208 (32,208 ) Total $ 21,902 $ 124,828 $ (102,926 ) Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December31, 2007 was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $7.0 million. This compared to termination income of $8.1 million for the year ended December31, 2006. We expect to recognize approximately $6 million of termination income for the year 2008.
Real Estate Operating Expenses The $18.1 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $29.2 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $29.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $12.7 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $3.3 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $2.0 million.
Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $29.2 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $2.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 3% over the prior year to date. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $10.7 million due to increased real estate tax assessments and repairs and maintenance increased approximately $8.4 million. The remaining $7.6 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is related to an increase in cleaning contracts and other general and administrative items.

In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and during July 2006, we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service.
A decrease of approximately $29.1 million in the Total Property Portfolio operating expenses was due to the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006, as detailed below: Date Sold RealEstateOperatingExpenses fortheyearended December31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Democracy Center August7,2007 $ 4,204 $ 6,144 $ (1,940 ) 5 Times Square February15,2007 2,165 14,988 (12,823 ) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006  14,307 (14,307 ) Total $ 6,369 $ 35,439 $ (29,070 ) We continue to reviewand monitor the impact of rising energy costs, as well as other factors, onour operating budgets for fiscal year 2008.Because some operating expensesare not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses due to one or more ofthe foregoingfactors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
51 Table of Contents Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $2.0 million, a 24.8% increase for the year ended December31, 2007 as compared to 2006. For the year ended December31, 2006, the operations of the Long Wharf Marriott was included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on March23, 2007.
The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 Percentage Change Occupancy 80.0 % 75.1 % 6.5 % Average daily rate $ 217.23 $ 194.52 11.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 173.80 $ 146.15 18.9 % Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006. We have maintained management contracts following the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June6, 2006 which contributed to an increase of approximately $1.1 million in management fees. A decrease of approximately $0.4 million was attributed to reduced work order income. We expect third-party fee income for the year 2008 to be between $19 million and $20 million, a slight increase due to leasing and management fees we are projecting to earn at 280 Park Avenue as well as fees generated from the additional investment in the Value-Added Fund.
Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $53.0 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. In February 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $862.5 million of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes. On February15, 2007, we completed the sale of our long-term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City for approximately $1.23 billion in cash. On March23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott for approximately $225.6 million in cash. On April5, 2007, we completed the sale of Newport Office Park for approximately $33.7 million in cash. On August7, 2007, we completed the sale of Democracy Center for approximately $184.5 million in cash and on November20, 2007, we completed the sale of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park Building E properties for an aggregate of approximately $125.4 million in cash.
We paid our special dividend and regular dividend payments totaling $6.66 per share on January30, 2008. Our current cash balance, after the dividends and our purchase of the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park, is approximately $750 million. As the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, short-term investment returns have decreased significantly and therefore we anticipate interest income to be between approximately $22 million to $25 million for the year 2008.
Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006. An overall increase of approximately $2.6 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in long-term compensation expense of approximately $3.5 million. For the year ended December31, 2007, we recognized 52 Table of Contents additional expenses related to abandoned project costs of approximately $4.5 million. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to be between $74 million and $75 million for the year 2008. A significant portion of the expected increase results from the inclusion of the 2008 OPP Awards described below, which adds approximately $4.9 million in 2008.
On January24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These awards (the 2008 OPP Awards) are part of a new broad-based long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February5, 2008 to February5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. We expect that under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R) Share-Based Payment the 2008 OPP Awards will have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period (although awards for retirement-eligible employees will be amortized over a three-year period). Because the 2008 OPP Awards requires a sustained price target to achieve the threshold stock price, unless the target has actually been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we will exclude all contingently issueable shares from the diluted EPS calculation. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four- or five-year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to "stock-based compensation." Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five-year vesting period.
Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease is due to (1)the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, which decreased interest expense by $11.2 million, (2)the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, 191 Spring Street, 101 Carnegie Center, Seven Cambridge Center, Embarcadero Center Three and Embarcadero Center Four, 504, 506, 508 and 510 Carnegie Center Properties, which decreased interest expense 53 Table of Contents by approximately $15.9 million, and (3)an increase in capitalized interest costs which results in a decrease of interest expense of approximately $18.5 million. These decreases were offset by (1)an increase of approximately $4.4 million related to interest paid on the $450 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership at a per annum interest rate of 3.75%, (2)an increase of approximately $26.2 million related to interest paid on the $862.5 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2007 by our Operating Partnership at an effective per annum interest rate of 3.438% and (3)an increase of approximately $4.3 million related to the acquisition of Kingstowne Towne Center on March30, 2007 as well as the consolidation of our 505 9 th joint venture property due to the involvement we now have because the property is operational. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt.
At December31, 2007, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at South of Market. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December31, 2007 compared with December31, 2006: December31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $20.6 million related to the 2007 acquisitions compared with the 2006 activity, approximately $0.7 million related to partially placing in-service 505 9th Street in the fourth quarter of 2007, approximately $1.3 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter of 2006, and approximately $0.7 million was due to the placing in-service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 compared with 280 Park Avenue in 2006, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $15.3 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006.
Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and 54 Table of Contents administrative expenses discussed above. We expect capitalized wages to increase proportionately with our increased development activity and increased wages into 2008. Interest capitalized for the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
Losses from early extinguishments of debt On February12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57%per annum and matures on March1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Towermortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment.

For the year ended December31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized deferred finance costs.
Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures For the year ended December31, 2007, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $4.1 million. On June1, 2007, our Value-Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza located in Herndon, Virginia for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was approximately $20.3 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million.

For the year ended December31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership includes our outside equity interest in Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity.

Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $5.1 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to 2006. In connection with the special dividend declared on December17, 2007 payable on January30, 2008, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2008 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement.

Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $33.3 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $35.5 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $17.5 million in straight-line rents, primarily due to the reduction of free rent at Times Square Tower during the prior year. Approximately $14.2 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $1.0 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income.
The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we placed our West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development into service which is included as part of Seven Cambridge Center below.

59 Table of Contents The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street during 2005. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property through agreements entered into at the time of sale. Rental Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $72.2 million, as detailed below: Property Date Sold RentalRevenueforthe yearendedDecember31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 $ 32,207 $ 72,184 $ (39,977 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005  8,760 (8,760 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005  8,406 (8,406 ) Embarcadero Center West Tower December14,2005  15,081 (15,081 ) Total $ 32,207 $ 104,431 $ (72,224 ) Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December31, 2006 was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $8.1 million. This compared to termination income of $11.5 million for the year ended December31, 2005 related to twenty-three tenants.
Real Estate Operating Expenses The $3.4 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $21.4 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $30.5 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $5.8 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $4.6 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $2.0 million.
Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $21.4 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $5.4 million, which represents an increase of approximately 7% over the prior year to date. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $8.5 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, with more than half of this increase specifically attributed to properties located in New York City. The remaining $10.2 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is related to an increase in repairs and maintenance.

A decrease of approximately $30.5 million in the Total Property Portfolio operating expenses was due to the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, as detailed below: Property Date Sold RealEstateOperatingExpenses fortheyearended December31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 $ 14,307 $ 32,418 $ (18,111 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005  3,019 (3,019 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005  2,864 (2,864 ) Embarcadero Center West Tower December14,2005  6,517 (6,517 ) Total $ 14,307 $ 44,818 $ (30,511 ) Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties increased approximately $1.2 million, a 17.08% increase for the year ended December31, 2006 as compared to 2005. For the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, the operations of the Long Wharf Marriott have been included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on March23, 2007. For the year ended December31, 2005 the operations of the Residence Inn by Marriott has been included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on November4, 2005.
The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December31, 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 Percentage Change Occupancy 75.1 % 73.7 % 1.9 % Average daily rate $ 194.52 $ 176.98 9.9 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 146.15 $ 130.47 12.0 % 61 Table of Contents Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005. Management Service income has increased approximately $1.6 million due to management contracts following the sales of 100 East Pratt Street, Riverfront Plaza and Embarcadero Center West Tower in 2005, as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June6, 2006. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to tenant improvement construction management fees earned, the majority of which was in San Francisco. An increase in development income of approximately $0.4 million was due to the increasing development activity at our 505 9 th Street joint venture project.
Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $24.7 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. During the second quarter of 2006, we issued $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On June6, 2006, we completed the sale of 280 Park Avenue for net cash proceeds of approximately $875 million. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2006, including 280 Park Avenue and 265 Franklin Street.
Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.9 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005. An overall increase of approximately $4.7 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005 and approximately $1.5 million related to tax savings during 2005. These increases were offset by approximately $2.1 million of decreased accounting- and legal-related expenses, and other overall decreases aggregating approximately $0.2 million.
Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 through 2006, vesting occurs over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted in 2007, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and all subsequent LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 and approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest.
Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the decreases are due to (1)the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, and Embarcadero Center West Tower in October 2005, which collectively decreased interest expense by $20.4 million and (2)the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, Montvale Center, 101 Carnegie Center, 191 Spring Street and 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard, which decreased interest expense approximately $8.2 million. These decreases were offset by (1)increases of 62 Table of Contents approximately $8.6 million at Times Square Tower due to increasing interest rates (5.85% on December31, 2006 and 4.87% on December31, 2005) and the increased principal balance due to the refinancing of the mortgage loan in June 2005, (2)an increase of approximately $12.3 million related to interest paid on the $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership and (3)a net increase of approximately $1.2 million due to the interest imputed on the unpaid redemption price related to the redemption of the outside members equity interest at Citigroup Center to reflect the fair value of debt as well as the impact of placing Seven Cambridge Center into service prior to the repayment of debt. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt.
At December31, 2006, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at Times Square Tower, South of Market and our secured borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December31, 2006 compared with December31, 2005: December31, 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,889,447 $ 3,952,151 Variable rate 711,490 874,103 Total $ 4,600,937 $ 4,826,254 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 84.54 % 81.89 % Variable rate 15.46 % 18.11 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.19 % 6.61 % Variable rate 5.80 % 4.96 % Total 6.13 % 6.31 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $7.3 million due to the placing in-service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006, approximately $6.8 million related to the acquisition of Prospect Place on December30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard on June30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center in November 2006, and approximately $1.4 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $14.2 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $8.4 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005.
Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other 63 Table of Contents project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December31, 2006 and 2005 were $7.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December31, 2006 and 2005 was $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
Losses from early extinguishments of debt For the year ended December31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized deferred finance costs.

There were no significant prepayment penalties or write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs related to these repayments.
In connection with the sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in May 2005, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year ended December31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss from early extinguishment of debt, which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan and the modification on our Unsecured Line of Credit.
Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures On September15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million.
Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest For the year ended December31, 2006, the Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run, Building E, Long Wharf Marriott and Newport Office Park were included as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest.

64 Table of Contents Minority interest in property partnership Minority interest in property partnership consists of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holders interest at Citigroup Center on May31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership will no longer reflect an allocation to the minority interest holder.
Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $1.5 million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to 2005. In connection with the special dividend declared on December15, 2006 payable on January30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December31, 2006.
In connection with the special cash distribution declared in July 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million for the year ended December31, 2005 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount is reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December31, 2005. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minorityinterest inour Operating Partnerships income allocationrelated toan underlying increase in allocable income.
Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On June6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations.
In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes.
Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Street which are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. In addition, the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland are included in gains on sales of real estate and other assets for the year ended December31, 2005. Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations.
65 Table of Contents Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Old Federal Reserve in April 2005, Residence Inn by Marriott and 40-46 Harvard Street, both which were sold in November 2005.
Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No.47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.143 (FIN 47).FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.At December31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2005.
Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to:  fund normal recurring expenses;  meet debt service and principal repayment obligations including balloon payments on maturing debt;  fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs;  fund current development costs not covered under construction loans;  fund the costs associated with the settlement of our hedge agreements at maturity;  fund possible property acquisitions; and  make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
On December17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.98 per common share that was paid on January30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2007, including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park - Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. The Board of Directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. The payment of the regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and the special dividend of $5.98 per share resulted in a total payment of $6.66 per share paid on January30, 2008.
We believe that our liquidity needs during 2008, including approximately $451.0 million of estimated development costs, will be satisfied using our approximately $750 million of cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our line of credit (currently $582.9 million) and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We may also generate cash from asset sales. Base rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification.
66 Table of Contents We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes.
Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, possible property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:  construction loans;  long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness);  income from operations;  income from joint ventures;  sales of real estate;  issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in BPLP; and  our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities.
We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by BPLP, our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved.
To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
67 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion and $725.8 million at December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, respectively, representing an increase of $781.1 million. The increase was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows: Years ended December31, 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 629,378 $ 527,979 $ 101,399 Net cash provided by investing activities $ 576,931 $ 229,756 $ 347,175 Net cash used in financing activities $ (425,176 ) $ (293,443 ) $ 131,773 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.4 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past two years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and raised proceeds from secured and unsecured borrowings.
In 2007, our total dividends exceeded our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend which was declared in December 2006 and paid to common stockholders and common unitholders of BPLP on January30, 2007. The cash flows distributed were generated from sales of real estate assets and proceeds from the sales are included as part of cash flows from investment activities. We expect that in 2008 our total dividends will exceed our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend declared in December 2007. Dividends will generally exceed cash flows from operating activities during periods in which we sell significant real estate assets and distribute gains on sale that would otherwise be taxable.
Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December31, 2007 consisted of the following: (inthousands) Net proceeds from the sales of real estate $ 1,897,988 Cash recorded upon consolidation 3,232 The cash provided by these investing activities is offset by: Net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (7,790 ) Investments in securities (22,584 ) Recurring capital expenditures (35,506 ) Planned non-recurring capital expenditures associated with acquisition properties (1,490 ) Hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements (1,127 ) Net Proceeds from the sale of real estate placed in escrow (161,321 ) Acquisitions/additions to real estate (1,094,471 ) Net cash provided by investing activities $ 576,931 Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December31, 2007 totaled approximately $425.2 million. This consisted primarily of the $840 million of net proceeds from our offering of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes and proceeds from mortgage notes payable, offset by the repayment of our Embarcadero Center Four mortgage loan, Times Square Tower mortgage loan and other mortgage notes payable, our secured draw under our Unsecured Line of Credit, as well as the payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and the unitholders of our Operating Partnership. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Debt Financing.
68 Table of Contents Capitalization At December31, 2007, our total consolidated debt was approximately $5.5 billion. The GAAP weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 5.60% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.2 years.
Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total market capitalization was approximately $18.5 billion at December31, 2007. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December31, 2007 closing stock price of $91.81 per common share and the following: (1)119,502,485 shares of our common stock, (2)20,271,341 outstanding common units of limited partnership of BPLP (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3)an aggregate of 1,460,688 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding preferred units of partnership interest in BPLP, (4)an aggregate of 676,067 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units, and (5)our consolidated debt totaling approximately $5.5 billion. Our total consolidated debt at December31, 2007 represented approximately 29.66% of our total market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
Debt Financing As of December31, 2007, we had approximately $5.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness, representing 29.66% of our total market capitalization as calculated above consisting of (1)$1.472 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured debt having a weighted-average interest rate of 5.95%per annum and maturities in 2013 and 2015; (2)$450 million of publicly traded exchangeable unsecured debt having an interest rate of 3.75%per annum, an initial optional redemption date in 2013 and maturity in 2036; (3)$844.1 million (net of discount) of publicly traded exchangeable unsecured debt having an interest rate of 2.875%per annum (an effective rate of 3.438%per annum) having an initial optional redemption in 2012 and maturing in 2037; and (4)$2.7 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 6.32%per annum and weighted-average term of 5.1 years. The table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable, our senior unsecured notes and our Unsecured Line of Credit at December31, 2007 and 2006: December31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % 69 Table of Contents The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate or Eurodollar rates. As of December31, 2007, the interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 1.25%per annum. On September27, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 5.82%per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. On February12, 2007, we repaid $700 million of variable rate indebtedness which was outstanding at December31, 2006 consisting of (1)the $225.0 million draw on our Unsecured Line of Credit, which draw was collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue, and (2)the mortgage loan collateralized by Times Square Tower totaling $475.0 million. The variable rate indebtedness was repaid with proceeds from a new mortgage financing secured by 599 Lexington Avenue totaling $750.0 million, which bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57%per annum and matures on March1, 2017. On December19, 2006, we terminated our forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that we had entered into in connection with the expected new mortgage financing and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38%per annum.
Unsecured Line of Credit On August3, 2006, we modified our $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Unsecured Line of Credit) by extending the maturity date from October30, 2007 to August3, 2010, with a provision for a one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.65% to Eurodollar plus 0.55%per annum. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 15 basis points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in our Operating Partnerships unsecured debt ratings. Based on our current debt ratings, the per annum variable interest rate is Eurodollar plus 0.475%. In addition, we pay a facility fee payable quarterly of 0.125%per annum. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Company at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. The Unsecured Line of Credit is available to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to fund development of properties, land and property acquisitions and to repay or reduce indebtedness. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership.
Our ability to borrow under our Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including:  a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days;  a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%;  a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40;  an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days;  a minimum net worth requirement;  an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and  limitations on permitted investments.
We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above.
As of December31, 2007, we had no amount outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit with the ability to borrow $582.9 million. As of February 22, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Unsecured Line of Credit.

Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December31, 2007 are as follows (in thousands): Year PrincipalPayments 2008 $ 598,606 2009 214,345 2010 130,807 2011 544,688 2012 100,393 Thereafter 1,119,725 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair 74 Table of Contents value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 98% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates.
In July and August 2007,we entered into nine interest rate contracts, known as treasury locks, which fix the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average rate of 4.74%per annum on notional amounts aggregating $325.0 million. The treasury locksfixthe 10-year treasury ratefor a long-term fixed-rate financing commencing in April 2008 and expiring in April 2018. We expect to settle the interest rate contracts at the timewe lock the rate on long-term fixed-rate financing. If the 10-year treasury rate is below the fixed strike rate at the timewesettle each contract,we would be required to make a payment to the contract counterparties; if the 10-year treasury rate is above the fixed strike rate at the timewe cash settle each contract,we would receive a payment from the contract counterparties.The amount thatwe either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year treasury rate at the timewesettle each contract.These treasury locksqualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.
In August and September 2007,we entered into four forward-starting interest rate swap contractsto lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spread. The swaps fixed the 10-year swap rate for a financing in July 2008 at a weighted-average rate of 5.21%per annum on notional amounts aggregating $125.0 million. The 10-year treasury rate is a component of the 10-year swap rate and the swap contracts effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.53%per annum. The forward-starting swaps fixthe 10-year swap ratefor a long-term fixed-rate financing commencing in July 2008 and expiring in July 2018. We expect to settle the interest rate contracts in cashat the timewe lock the rate on long-term fixed-rate financing. If the 10-year swap rate is below the fixed strike rate at the timewesettle each contract,we would be required to make a payment to the contract counter-parties; if the 10-year swap rate is above the fixed strike rate at the timewe cash settle each contract,we would receive a payment from the contract counterparties.The amount thatwe either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year swap rate at the timewesettle each contract. We believe that these swapsqualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.
On November2, 2007, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap contract to lock the 10-year LIBOR swap rate on a notional amount of $25.0 million at a forward-starting 10-year swap rate of 5.05%per annum. The 10-year treasury rate is a component of the 10-year swap rate and the referenced contract effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at 4.38%. The swap contract goes into effect on July31, 2008 and expires on July31, 2018. On November9, 2007 and November16, 2007, we entered into treasury locks to fix the 10-year treasury rate at 4.33%per annum on a notional amount of $25 million and 4.24%per annum on a notional amount of $25.0 million, respectively. The treasury locks mature on July31, 2008.
We have effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted average interest rate of 4.63%per annum on notional amounts aggregating $525.0 million with our interest rate hedging program.
On September27, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate (including a 1.25% spread), at 5.82%per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. The swap contract went into effect on October22, 2007 and expires on October29, 2008.
75 Table of Contents We have recorded the changes in fair value of the treasury lock and swap contracts related to the effective portion of the interest rate contracts executed during 2007 totaling a liability of approximately $25.7 million in Other Liabilities and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect that within the next twelve months we will reclassify into earnings as interest expense approximately $2.1 million of the amounts recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relating to the treasury lock contracts and forward-starting interest rate swap contracts.
During 2005, we entered into twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contractsto lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spreads. On December19, 2006, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a lender for a fixed interest rate of 5.57%per annum on a ten-year mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million to be collateralized by our 599 Lexington Avenue property in New York City. We closed on the mortgage financing on February12, 2007. In conjunction with the interest rate lock agreement, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38%per annum. Over the next twelve months we will reclassify into earnings as a reduction of interest expense approximately $1.1 million of the amounts recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relating to the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts.
At December31, 2007, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $122.9 million, of which approximately $96.7 million is fixed at 5.82% due to the interest rate swap contract we entered into on September27, 2007. At December31, 2007, the interest rate on our unhedged variable rate debt was approximately 5.88%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December31, 2007.
At December31, 2006, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $711 million. At December31, 2006, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 5.80%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December31, 2006.
These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.
Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 85.32%, 84.40%, 83.74%, 82.97% and 82.06% for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,after allocation tothe minority interest in the Operating Partnership.
76 Table of Contents In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, for the year ended December31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts.
The adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debts stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment.Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP.However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions.We believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions.
The adjustment for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the year ended December31, 2003 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No.133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No.133 on January1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment.
Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREITs definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO.
Neither FFO, nor FFO as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

79 Table of Contents Net Operating Income Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.
Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.
The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2003 through 2007.

(3) Represents revenue support obligations and master lease obligations related to the sales of 5 Times Square in February 2007 and 280 Park in June 2006 as well as the remaining obligation related to our redemption of partnership interests in Citigroup Center.
We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Ventures We have investments in eight unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 51%, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December31, 2007, the debt related to these ventures was equal to approximately $565.6 million. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December31, 2007: Properties Venture Ownership % GAAP InterestRate Principal Amount (inthousands) Maturity Date Metropolitan Square 51 % 8.23 % $ 128,726 May1,2010 Market Square North 50 % 7.74 % 87,951 December19,2010 Eighth Avenue and 46th Street 50 % 8.34 % 23,600 (1) May 8, 2008 Annapolis Junction 50 % 6.27 % 14,372 September12,2010 901 New York Avenue 25 % 5.27 % 170,000 January 1, 2015 Circle Star 25 % 6.57 % 42,000 (2) September 1, 2013 300 Billerica Road 25 % 5.69 % 7,500 (2) January 1, 2016 Wisconsin Place 23.89 % 6.86 % 51,057 (3) March 11, 2009 (3) Wisconsin Place 23.89 % 4.38 % 7,473 (4) January 1, 2008 (4) Wisconsin Place Retail 5 % 6.62 % 32,889 (5) March 29, 2010 (5) Total $ 565,568 81 Table of Contents (1) The financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%per annum.
(2) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund.
(3) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $96.5 million loan commitment (of which our share is $23.1 million) at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50%per annum with a maturity in March 2009. The mortgage debt requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. On March29, 2007, the entity executed an amendment to its construction loan agreement. The outstanding balance on the construction loan was approximately $53.6 million of the $96.5 million commitment. The amended agreement provides for a reduction in the loan commitment amount to $69.1 million. The reduction relates to the repayment of the retail portion of the outstanding balance totaling approximately $15.9 million and an additional reduction in the borrowing capacity of approximately $11.5 million with a corresponding release of collateral in conjunction with the retail entity obtaining new construction financing. On January29, 2008, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity that owns and is developing the office component of the project obtained construction financing totaling approximately $115.0 million collateralized by the office property. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25%per annum and matures on January29, 2011 with two, one-year extension options.
(4) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted to reflect the fair value of the note using an effective interest rate of 4.38%per annum. This note is non-interest bearing with a stated principal balance of $7.5 million and matures in January 2008. On February1, 2008 the joint venture repaid this loan.
(5) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $66.0 million loan commitment collateralized by the retail entity of Wisconsin Place. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use development project consisting of office, retail and residential properties located in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375%per annum and matures on March29, 2010 with two one-year extension options.
Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.
In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1)bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2)continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3)indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.
Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the 82 Table of Contents properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.
We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.
Newly Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN No.48).FIN No.48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.FIN No.48 also provides guidance on description, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.FIN No.48 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. FIN No.48, which we adopted effective January1, 2007, did not have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No.157). SFAS No.157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No.157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No.157. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No.157 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
83 Table of Contents In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 (SFAS No.159). SFAS No.159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. We are currently evaluating and assessing the impact of this statement.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFASNo.141(R)), which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No.141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No.141(R) will have on our financial position and results of operations.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan Amendment of ARB No.51 (SFAS No.160), which establishes and expands accounting and reporting standards for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No.160 is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No.160 will have on our financial position and results of operations.
Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations.

86 Table of Contents Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of Boston Properties, Inc. (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.
As of the end of the Companys 2007 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 was effective.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page88, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007.
87 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Properties, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 87. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.143.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Organization and Basis of Presentation Organization Boston Properties, Inc. (the Company), a Delaware corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). The Company is the sole general partner of Boston Properties Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership) and at December31, 2007 owned an approximate 84.2% (83.3% at December31, 2006) general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are denominated as common units of partnership interest (also referred to as OP Units), long term incentive units of partnership interest (also referred to as LTIP Units) or preferred units of partnership interest (also referred to as Preferred Units).
Unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership must redeem such OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company (Common Stock). In lieu of a cash redemption, the Company may elect to acquire such OP Unit for one share of Common Stock. Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, one share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of one OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted common stock of the Company. LTIP Units, whether vested or not, will receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends on Common Stock (See Note 17).
At December31, 2007, there was one series of Preferred Units outstanding (i.e., Series Two Preferred Units). The Series Two Preferred Units bear a distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Preferred Units may also be converted into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof or the Operating Partnership in accordance with the amendment to the partnership agreement (See Note 11).
All references to the Company refer to Boston Properties, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.
Properties At December31, 2007, the Company owned or had interests in a portfolio of 139 commercial real estate properties (131 properties at December31, 2006) (the Properties) aggregating approximately 43.8million net rentable square feet (approximately 43.4million net rentable square feet at December31, 2006), including 13 properties under construction totaling approximately 3.9million net rentable square feet, and structured parking for approximately 32,054 vehicles containing approximately 9.9million square feet. At December31, 2007, the Properties consist of:  135 office properties, including 115 ClassA office properties (including 13 properties under construction) and 20 Office/Technical properties;  one hotel; and  three retail properties.
95 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company owns or controls undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 605.2 acres. In addition, at December31, 2007, the Company had a 25% interest in the Boston Properties Office Value-Added Fund, L.P. (the Value-Added Fund), which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors through which the Company has pursued the acquisition of value-added investments in assets within its existing markets. The Companys investments through the Value-Added Fund are not included in its portfolio information or any other portfolio level statistics. At December31, 2007, the Value-Added Fund had investments in an office property in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and an office complex in San Carlos, California.
The Company considers ClassA office properties to be centrally located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, that attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. The Company considers Office/Technical properties to be properties that support office, research and development, laboratory and other technical uses. Net rentable square feet amounts are unaudited.
Basis of Presentation Boston Properties, Inc. does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in the Operating Partnership, nor does it have employees of its own. The Operating Partnership, not Boston Properties, Inc., executes all significant business relationships. All majority-owned subsidiaries and affiliates over which the Company has financial and operating control and variable interest entities (VIEs) in which the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary are included in the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for all other unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Companys share of the earnings of these joint ventures and companies is included in consolidated net income.
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No.46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which amended FIN 46. FIN 46R was effective immediately for arrangements entered into after January31, 2003, and became effective during the first quarter of 2004 for all arrangements entered into before February1, 2003. FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated VIEs to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses or receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership interests, contractual interests, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. Prior to FIN 46R, the Company included an entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests.
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.141, Business Combinations), and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. The Company assesses and considers fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known 96 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The Company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on its acquisitions to date, the Companys allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
The Company records acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1)the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2)managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Companys evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used, as defined by SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, (SFAS No.144) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, the Companys established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If the Companys strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.
SFAS No.144, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and the Company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). The Company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.
97 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The Companys capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No.34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No.67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. The Company ceases capitalization on the portion (1)substantially completed and (2)occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $31.0 million, $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $6.9 million, $4.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
The acquisitions of minority interests (i.e., OP Units) for shares of the Companys common stock are recorded under the purchase method with assets acquired reflected at the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of acquisition. The acquisition amounts are allocated to the underlying assets based on their estimated fair values.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Significant betterments are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period.
Certain of the Companys real estate assets contain asbestos. Although the asbestos is appropriately encapsulated, in accordance with current environmental regulations, the Companys practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No.47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.143 (FIN 47). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurredgenerally upon the acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of an asset. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 became effective and was adopted by the Company on December31, 2005. Upon adoption, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of A Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2005 The Company computes depreciation and amortization on properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No.141, the Company allocates the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciates or amortizes these assets 98 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (or liabilities) over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Land improvements 25to40 years Buildings and improvements 10to40years Tenant improvements Shorterofusefullifeortermsofrelatedlease Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 to 7 years Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit of $100,000. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.
Cash Held in Escrows Escrows include amounts established pursuant to various agreements for security deposits, property taxes, insurance and other costs.
Investment in Securities The Company accounts for investments in trading securities atfair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. At December31, 2007, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund. The investment was previously included in Cash and Cash Equivalents. In December 2007, the fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors may elect in-kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities mature or are liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, the Company expects to retain this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of the Companys investment is subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund are now valued at less than their $1.00 par value, the Company has recognized a loss of approximately $0.3 million on its investment during the fourth quarter of 2007.
Tenant and other receivables Tenant and other accounts receivable, other than accrued rents receivable, are expected to be collected within one year.
Deferred Charges Deferred charges include leasing costs and financing fees. Leasing costs include an allocation for acquired intangible in-place lease values and direct and incremental fees and costs incurred in the successful negotiation of leases, including brokerage, legal, internal leasing employee salaries and other costs which have been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Internal leasing salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $4.1 million, $2.8 99 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) million and $2.0 million, respectively. External fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing have been deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans on a basis that approximates the effective interest method and are included with interest expense. Unamortized financing and leasing costs are charged to expense upon the early repayment or significant modification of the financing or upon the early termination of the lease, respectively. Fully amortized deferred charges are removed from the books upon the expiration of the lease or maturity of the debt.
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because it exercises significant influence over, but does not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the Companys share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, the Companys recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, the Company consolidates those in which it is the primary beneficiary. The Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of the investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. The Company will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the value of an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary.
To the extent that the Company contributes assets to a joint venture, the Companys investment in the joint venture is recorded at the Companys cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that the Companys cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in the Companys share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 78-9 Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures, the Company will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partners interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.
Equity Offering Costs Underwriting commissions and offering costs have been reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
Treasury Stock The Companys share repurchases are reflected as treasury stock utilizing the cost method of accounting and are presented as a reduction to consolidated stockholders equity. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006.
100 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Dividends Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, will differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of gains on the sale of real property, revenue and expense recognition, compensation expense, and in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation.
The tax treatment of common dividends per share for federal income tax purposes is as follows: For the year ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 PerShare % PerShare % PerShare % Ordinary income $ 2.03 26.15 % $ 1.19 17.43 % $ 1.80 34.90 % Capital gain income 5.75 73.85 % 5.65 82.57 % 2.10 40.75 % Return of capital     1.26 24.35 % Total $ 7.78 (1) 100.00 % $ 6.84 (2) 100.00 % $ 5.16 (3) 100.00 % (1) Includes the special dividend of $5.98 per common share paid on January30, 2008 of which approximately $3.10 per common share is allocable to 2007 and approximately $2.88 is allocable to 2008.
(2) Includes the special dividend of $5.40 per common share paid on January30, 2007 of which approximately $3.44 per common share is allocable to 2006 and approximately $1.96 is allocable to 2007.
(3) Includes the special dividend of $2.50 per common share paid on October31, 2005.
Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately $39.1 million, $53.7 million and $66.0 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, as the revenue recorded exceeded amounts billed. In accordance with SFAS No.141, the Company recognizes rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. The Company maintains an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential tenant credit losses. The credit assessment is based on the estimated accrued rental income that is recoverable over the term of the lease. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments. The computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit status, as well as certain industry or geographic specific credit considerations. If the Companys estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of the Companys reported revenue could be impacted. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of the Companys existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of the Companys portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with EITF Issue 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent (Issue 99-19). Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as the Company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third- party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and has credit risk. The Company also receives reimbursement of payroll and payroll related cost from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99-19.
101 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Companys hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.
The Company receives management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. The Company reviews each development agreement and records development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest.
Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.66 Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No.66 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, the Company defers gain recognition and accounts for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.
Interest Expense and Interest Rate Protection Agreements From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate protection agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt or in anticipation of issuing fixed rate debt. The fair value of these agreements is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of these agreements would be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations if the agreements were not effective for accounting purposes.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, as adjusted for unallocated earnings (if any) of certain securities issued by the Operating Partnership, by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and conversion of the minority interests in the Operating Partnership.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
For purposes of disclosure, the Company calculates the fair value of mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. The Company discounts the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, the Company adds its estimation of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to its debt. Because the Companys valuations of its financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of its financial instruments may change if the Companys estimates do not prove to be accurate. The fair value of the Companys long-term indebtedness exceeds the aggregate carrying value by approximately $59.7 million at December31, 2007.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Income Taxes The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), commencing with its taxable year ended December31, 1997. As a result, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. The Companys policy is to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income. Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the Companys consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries. The Companys taxable REIT subsidiaries did not have significant tax provisions or deferred income tax items.
In January 2002, the Company formed a taxable REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc. (IXP) which acts as a captive insurance company and is one of the elements of its overall insurance program. On September27, 2006, IXP, Inc. was merged into IXP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, and all insurance policies issued by IXP, Inc. were cancelled and reissued by IXP, LLC. The accounts of IXP are consolidated within the Company. IXP, Inc. was a captive TRS that was subject to tax at the federal and state level. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a tax provision in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005.
Effective July1, 2002, the Company restructured the leases with respect to its ownership of its hotel properties by forming a taxable REIT subsidiary. The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is the lessee pursuant to leases for each of the hotel properties. As lessor, the Operating Partnership is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel properties. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel properties under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. In connection with the restructuring, the revenue and expenses of the hotel properties are being reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax at the federal and state level and, accordingly, the Company has recorded a tax provision in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
The net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities is approximately $756 million and $674 million as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Certain entities included in the Companys consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state and local taxes. These taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Stock-based employee compensation plans At December31, 2007, the Company has a stock-based employee compensation plan. Effective January1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.123, using the modified prospective application method for stock compensation awards. In addition, effective January1, 2005, the Company adopted early SFAS No.123 (revised) (SFAS No.123R), Share-Based Payment, which revised the fair value based method of accounting for share-based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards and clarified SFAS No.123s guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include such items as depreciation and allowances for doubtful accounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Unsecured Exchangeable Senior Notes 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2036 On April6, 2006, the Companys Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On May2, 2006, the Operating Partnership issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of the exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option. The notes mature on May15, 2036, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed.
Upon the occurrence of specified events, holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding May18, 2013 into cash and, at the Operating Partnerships option, shares of the Companys common stock at an exchange rate of 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of common stock). The initial 114 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) exchange rate of 8.9461 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the initial exchange price of approximately $111.78 per share of the Companys common stock were adjusted to an exchange rate of 9.3900 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and an exchange price of approximately $106.50 per share of common stock effective as of December29, 2006 in connection with the special dividend declared on December15, 2006. The exchange rate and exchange price were further adjusted to the current exchange rate of 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the current exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of common stock effective as of December31, 2007 in connection with the special dividend declared on December17, 2007. On and after May18, 2013, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date at the option of the holder at the applicable exchange rate. The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
Prior to May18, 2013, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the notes except to preserve the Companys status as a REIT. On or after May18, 2013, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Operating Partnership must make at least 12 semi-annual interest payments (including interest payments on November15, 2006 and May15, 2013) before redeeming any notes at the option of the Operating Partnership. Note holders may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on May18, 2013 and May15 of 2016, 2021, 2026 and 2031 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so repurchased.
If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, note holders will have the option to require the Operating Partnership to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date. The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so purchased. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to May18, 2013, the Operating Partnership will increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its notes in connection with such a fundamental change under certain circumstances. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and will rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. The notes will effectively rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. The notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.
2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2037 On February6, 2007, the Companys Operating Partnership completed an offering of $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount (including $112.5 million as a result of the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option) of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037.

The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so repurchased.
If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, note holders will have the option to require the Operating Partnership to purchase all or any portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.

The notes will effectively rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership. The notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.
In connection with the closing, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) with the initial purchasers, under which the Company and the Operating Partnership agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and maintain a shelf registration statement providing for the sale by the holders of the notes and the Companys common stock, if any, issuable upon exchange of the notes. The Company and the Operating Partnership will be required to pay liquidated damages in the form of specified additional interest to the holders of the notes if they fail to comply with these obligations; provided that the Operating Partnership will not be required to pay liquidated damages with respect to any note after it has been exchanged for any of the Companys common stock. On March13, 2007, the Company and the Operating Partnership filed with the SEC a registration statement covering the resale of the notes and shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the notes. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on April20, 2007.
9.Unsecured Line of Credit On August3, 2006, the Company modified its $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Unsecured Line of Credit) by extending the maturity date from October30, 2007 to August3, 2010, with a provision for a one-year extension at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.65% to Eurodollar plus 0.55%per annum. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of the Companys Operating Partnership. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 15 basis points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in the Operating Partnerships unsecured debt ratings. Effective March22, 2007, the per annum variable interest rate was reduced to Eurodollar plus 0.475% and the facility fee was reduced to 12.5 basis points per annum as a result of an increase in the Operating Partnerships unsecured debt rating. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are 116 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Company at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. The Company had an outstanding balance on the Unsecured Line of Credit of $225.0 million at December31, 2006, which was collateralized by the Companys 599 Lexington Avenue property and therefore was included in Mortgage Notes Payable in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. On February12, 2007, the Company repaid the $225.0 million draw that was collateralized by the Companys 599 Lexington Avenue. As of December31, 2007, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Unsecured Line of Credit. The weighted-average balance outstanding was approximately $30.1 million and $240.4 million (including the $225.0 million collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue) during the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding was approximately 5.64% and 5.38% during the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The terms of the Unsecured Line of Credit require that the Company maintain a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: (1)a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, theleverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that itis reduced back to 60% within 180 days, (2)a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%, (3)a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40, (4)an unsecured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however, the unsecured debt leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that itis reduced back to 60% within 180 days, (5)a minimum net worth requirement, (6)an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 and (7)limitations on permitted investments, development, partially owned entities, business outside of commercial real estate and commercial non-office properties. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was in compliance with each of these financial and other covenant requirements.
10.
Commitments and Contingencies General In the normal course of business, the Company guarantees its performance of services or indemnifies third parties against its negligence.
The Company has letter of credit and performance obligations of approximately $28.0 million related to lender and development requirements.
The Company and its third-party joint venture partners have guaranteed the seller financing totaling $7.5 million related to the acquisition of land by WP Project Developer LLC, the Land and Infrastructure Entity of the Wisconsin Place joint venture entities. The seller financing was repaid on February1, 2008.
Certain of the Companys joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the joint ventures. Under these provisions, the Company is not compelled to purchase the interest of its outside joint venture partners.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Management of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of tenants and may require tenants to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees and/or other financial guarantees. Although the Companys properties are geographically diverse and the tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of rental revenue from any single tenant, the inability of that tenant to make its lease payments could have an adverse effect on the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
The Company carries insurance coverage on its properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that it believes are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September11, 2001, the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA) was enacted in November 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). The expiration date of TRIA was extended to December31, 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA). Prior to TRIPRA, only acts of foreign terrorism could be certified for coverage under TRIA. Under TRIPRA, acts of both foreign and domestic terrorism can be certified for coverage under TRIA. Currently, the Companys property insurance program per occurrence limits are $900 million, including coverage for foreign acts of terrorism certified under TRIA and coverage for domestic acts of terrorism up to $500 million per occurrence, and an additional $400 million of coverage for domestic acts of terrorism on a per occurrence and annual aggregate basis. Currently, the Company also carries nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage (NBCR Coverage) for foreign acts of terrorism certified under TRIA, which is provided by IXP, LLC as a direct insurer, excluding the Companys Value-Added Fund properties. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $900 million. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is $100 million andthe coinsurance is 10%. Under TRIPRA, if the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIPRA. The Company may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason. The Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.
The Company also currently carries earthquake insurance on its properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that the Company believes are commercially reasonable. In addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. Specifically, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its San Francisco region with a $120 million per occurrence limit and a $120 million annual aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by IXP, LLC, as a direct insurer. The amount of the Companys earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact the Companys ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. The Company may discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the Companys estimation of the value of the coverage.
In January 2002, the Company formed a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, IXP, Inc., to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of the Companys overall insurance program. On September27, 2006, IXP, Inc. was merged into IXP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, and all insurance policies issued by IXP, Inc. were cancelled and reissued by IXP, LLC. The term IXP refers to IXP, Inc. for the period prior to September27, 2006 and to IXP, LLC for the period on and subsequent to September27, 2006. IXP acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Companys earthquake insurance coverage for its Greater San Francisco properties and the Companys NBCR Coverage for foreign acts of terrorism certified under TRIA. Insofar as the Company owns IXP, it is responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of the Companys consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by the Companys NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP would also be 118 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out under TRIA and if IXP maintains the NBCR policy after the payout by the Federal Government. If the Company experiences a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, the Company would ultimately record the loss to the extent of IXPs required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.
The Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or the presence of mold at the Companys properties, for which the Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Companys business and financial condition and results of operations.
Legal Matters The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
State and Local Tax Matters Because the Company is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which the Company owns real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although the Company believes that it has substantial arguments in favor of its positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.
Environmental Matters It is the Companys policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with the Companys acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the Company is not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to its properties that the Company believes would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at the Companys properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.
In February 1999, the Company (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. The Company developed an office park 119 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) on the property. The Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1)bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to the Companys ownership, (2)continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3)indemnify the Company for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.
Environmental investigations at some of the Companys properties and certain properties owned by affiliates of the Company have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case the Company engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations, and assessments and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. The Company also believes that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although the Company believes that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, the Company will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
Some of the Companys properties and certain properties owned by the Companys affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is the Companys practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. The Company then uses this information as part of its decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, the Company owns a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable law.
The Company expects that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, the Company cannot assure you that it has identified all environmental liabilities at its properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at the Companys properties or that the Company will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Tax Protection Obligations In connection with the acquisition or contribution of 24 properties, the Company entered into agreements for the benefit of the selling or contributing parties which specifically state that until specified dates ranging from February 2008 to January 2009, or such time as the contributors do not hold at least a specified percentage of the OP Units owned by such person following the contribution of the properties, the Operating Partnership will not sell or otherwise transfer the properties in a taxable transaction. If the Company does sell or transfer the properties in a taxable transaction, it would be liable to the contributors for contractual damages.
11.
Minority Interests Minority interests relate to the interest in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company and interests in property partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company. As of December31, 2007, the minority interest in the Operating Partnership consisted of 20,271,341 OP Units, 676,067 LTIP Units and 1,113,044 Series Two Preferred Units (or 1,460,688 OP Units on an as converted basis) held by parties other than the Company.
The minority interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity interests in ventures that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entities that own the properties. The equity interests in these ventures that are not owned by the Company, totaling approximately $25.8 million and $12.5 million at December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, respectively, are included in Minority Interests on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
On February26, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to redeem the outside members equity interest in the limited liability company that owns 250 West 55th Street for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $23.4 million. The Company paid $17.0 million on February26, 2007, with $3.0 million paid on February26, 2008 and the balance of approximately $3.4 million payable in monthly installments from March1, 2007 through August1, 2009. The redemption was accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No.141 Business Combinations (SFAS No.141). The difference between the aggregate book value of the outside members equity interest totaling approximately $10.6 million and the purchase price increased the recorded value of the propertys net assets.
On May31, 2007 and June15, 2007, the Company paid an aggregate of $25.0 million in connection with the agreement entered into in May 2006 to redeem the outside members equity interests in the limited liability company that owns Citigroup Center. The remaining unpaid redemption price, which is to be paid on May31, 2008, is reflected at its fair value in Other Liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $24.4 million at December31, 2007.
During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, 606,186 and 1,982,105 Series Two Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership, respectively, were converted by the holders into 795,520 and 2,601,132 OP Units, respectively. In addition, the Company paid the accrued preferred distributions due to the holders of Preferred Units that were converted.
During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, 1,342,226 and 3,161,265 OP Units, respectively, were presented by the holders for redemption and were redeemed by the Company in exchange for an equal number of shares of Common Stock. The aggregate book value of the OP Units that were redeemed, as measured for each OP Unit on the date of its redemption, was approximately $30.6 million and $87.3 million during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The difference between the aggregate book value and the purchase price of these OP Units was approximately $112.7 million and $200.0 million during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which increased the recorded value of the Companys net assets.
121 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Preferred Units at December31, 2007 consist solely of 1,113,044 Series Two Preferred Units, which bear a preferred distribution equal to the greater of (1)the distribution which would have been paid in respect of the Series Two Preferred Unit had such Series Two Preferred Unit been converted into an OP Unit (including both regular and special distributions) or (2)an increasing rate, ranging from 5.00% to 7.00%per annum (7.00% for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005) on a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit, and are convertible into OP Units at a rate of $38.10 per Preferred Unit (1.312336 OP Units for each Preferred Unit). Distributions to holders of Preferred Units are recognized on a straight-line basis that approximates the effective interest method.
On December17, 2007, Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the Operating Partnership, declared a special cash distribution on the OP Units and LTIP Units in the amount of $5.98 per unit which was paid on January30, 2008 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on December31, 2007. The special cash distribution was in addition to the regular quarterly distributions of $0.68 per unit which were declared by Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the Operating Partnership, during the year ended December31, 2007. Holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate in the $5.98 per unit special cash distribution on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2008 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. At December31, 2007, the Company accrued approximately $8.7 million related to the $5.98 per unit special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $8.7 million, which amount has been reflected in Minority Interest in Operating Partnership within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2007.
On December15, 2006, Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the Operating Partnership, declared a special cash distribution on the OP Units and LTIP Units in the amount of $5.40 per unit which was paid on January30, 2007 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on December29, 2006. The special cash distribution was in addition to the regular quarterly distributions of $0.68 per unit which were declared by Boston Properties, Inc., as general partner of the Operating Partnership, during the year ended December31, 2006. Holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated in the $5.40 per unit special cash distribution on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. At December31, 2006, the Company accrued approximately $12.2 million related to the $5.40 per unit special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in Minority Interest in Operating Partnership within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2006. During the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recognized an adjustment of approximately $3.1 million to the special cash distribution accrual and allocation of earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units, as a result of conversions of Series Two Preferred Units, which amount has been reflected in Minority Interest in Operating Partnership within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Series Two Preferred Units may be converted into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof at any time. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership must redeem such OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company. In lieu of a cash redemption, the Company may elect to acquire such OP Unit for one share of Common Stock. The value of the OP Units (not owned by the Company and including LTIP Units assuming that all conditions have been met for the conversion thereof) and Series Two Preferred Units had such units been redeemed at December31, 2007 was approximately $1,923.2 million and $134.1 million, respectively, based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $91.81 per share.

Segment Reporting The Companys segments are based on the Companys method of internal reporting which classifies its operations by both geographic area and property type. The Companys segments by geographic area are Greater Boston, Greater Washington, D.C., Midtown Manhattan, Greater San Francisco and New Jersey. Segments by property type include: ClassA Office, Office/Technical and Hotels.
Asset information by segment is not reported because the Company does not use this measure to assess performance. Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments. Interest and other income, development and management services, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, 123 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) depreciation and amortization expense, losses from early extinguishments of debt, minority interests in property partnerships, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership, gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest) and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest) are not included in Net Operating Income as the internal reporting addresses these items on a corporate level.
Net Operating Income is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and it is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. All companies may not calculate Net Operating Income in the same manner. The Company considers Net Operating Income to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of the Companys properties.

The following table provides a reconciliation of both the net income and the number of common shares used in the computation of basic EPS, which is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. During 2004, the Company adopted EITF 03-6 Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB 128 (EITF 03-6), which provides further guidance on the definition of participating securities. Pursuant to EITF 03-6, the Operating Partnerships Series Two Preferred Units, which are reflected as Minority Interests in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, are considered participating securities and are included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of the Company if the effect of applying the if-converted method is dilutive. The terms of the Series Two Preferred Units enable the holders to obtain OP Units of the Operating Partnership, as well as Common Stock of the Company. Accordingly, for the reporting periods in which the Operating Partnerships net income is in excess of distributions paid on the OP Units, LTIP Units and Series Two Preferred Units, such income is allocated to the OP Units, LTIP Units and Series Two Preferred Units in proportion to their respective interests and the impact is included in the Companys consolidated basic and diluted earnings per share computation due to its holding of the Operating Partnerships securities. For the year ended December31, 2007, approximately $3.9 million was allocated to the Series Two Preferred Units in excess of distributions paid during the reporting period and is included in the Companys computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. There were no amounts required to be allocated to the Series Two Preferred Units for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005. Other potentially dilutive common shares, including stock options, restricted stock and other securities of 126 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 16.Employee Benefit Plans Effective January1, 1985, the predecessor of the Company adopted a 401(k) Savings Plan (the Plan) for its employees. Under the Plan, as amended, employees, as defined, are eligible to participate in the Plan after they have completed three months of service. Upon formation, the Company adopted the Plan and the terms of the Plan.
Effective January1, 2000, the Company amended the Plan by increasing the Companys matching contribution to 200% of the first 3% from 200% of the first 2% of participants eligible earnings contributed (utilizing earnings that are not in excess of an amount established by the IRS ($220,000 in 2006 and $225,000 in 2007), indexed for inflation) and by eliminating the vesting requirement. The Companys aggregate matching contribution for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $2.1 million, $2.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
Effective January1, 2001, the Company amended the Plan to provide a supplemental retirement contribution to employees who have at least ten years of service on January1, 2001, and who are 40 years of age or older as of January1, 2001. The maximum supplemental retirement contribution will not exceed the annual limit on contributions established by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company will record an annual supplemental retirement credit for the benefit of each participant. The Companys supplemental retirement contribution and credit for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $178,000, $191,000 and $189,000, respectively.
The Company also maintains a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow officers of the Company to defer a portion of their current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals. The Companys obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has funded approximately $8.3 million and $6.9 million, respectively, into a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. The Companys liability under the plan is equal to the total amount of compensation deferred by the plan participants and earnings on the deferred compensation pursuant to investments elected by the plan participants. The Companys liability as of December31, 2007 and 2006 was $8.3 million and $6.6 million, respectively, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
17.Stock Option and Incentive Plan and Stock Purchase Plan The Company has established a stock option and incentive plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining qualified employees and rewarding them for superior performance in achieving the Companys business goals and enhancing stockholder value.
At the Companys 2007 annual meeting of stockholders held on May 15, 2007, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Companys 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the Plan) that, among other things, (1) increased the limit on full value shares (i.e., awards other than stock options) that may be issued under the Plan by 2,500,000 shares, (2) extended the term of the Plan to May 15, 2017 and (3) added provisions that allow the Company to qualify certain grants under the Plan as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the amended plan, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance is 4,019,174 shares. At December31, 2007, the number of shares available for issuance under the plan was 3,876,184, of which a maximum of 3,423,348 shares may be granted as awards other than stock options.
Options granted under the plan became exercisable over a two-, three- or five-year period and have terms of ten years, as determined at the time of the grant. All options were granted at the fair market value of the Companys Common Stock at the dates of grant. As of January17, 2005, all outstanding options had become fully vested and exercisable.
128 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company issued 6,536, 9,182 and 12,317 shares of restricted stock and 156,161, 147,845 and 211,408 LTIP Units under the plan during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The shares of restricted stock were valued at approximately $0.8 million ($125.46 per share weighted-average), $0.8 million ($89.03 per share weighted-average) and $0.7 million ($57.99 per share weighted-average) for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. LTIP Units were valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123R. LTIP Units issued during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were valued at approximately $18.0 million, $11.2 million and $10.5 million, respectively. The weighted-average per unit fair value of LTIP Unit grants in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $115.47, $75.64 and $49.59, respectively. The per unit fair value of each LTIP Unit granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions; an expected life of 5.3 years, 6.5 years and 8 years, a risk-free interest rate of 4.82%, 4.97% and 3.96% and an expected price volatility of 18.00%, 17.84% and 20.00%, respectively. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of restricted stock in the Company. The aggregate value of the LTIP Units is included in Minority Interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted stock and LTIP Units granted to employees between January1, 2005 and November21, 2006 vest over a five-year term. Grants of restricted stock and LTIP Units made on and after November22, 2006 vest in four equal annual installments. Restricted stock and LTIP Units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted, as adjusted for forfeitures and the price of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. Dividends paid on both vested and unvested shares of restricted stock are charged directly to Earnings in Excess of Dividends in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock and LTIP Units was approximately $11.4 million, $7.7 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, in accordance with the modified prospective application transition provisions of SFAS No.123R, the Company has recognized compensation expense of approximately $50,000 relating to its unvested stock options for the year ended December31, 2005. At December31, 2007, there was $25.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock and LTIP Units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years.
In connection with the declaration of the special cash dividends of $5.98 per share of Common Stock paid on January30, 2008 to shareholders of record on December31, 2007, $5.40 per share of Common Stock paid on January30, 2007 to shareholders of record on December29, 2006 and $2.50 per share of Common Stock paid on October31, 2005 to shareholders of record on September30, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved adjustments to all its outstanding stock option awards that were intended to ensure that its employees, directors and other persons who held such stock options were not disadvantaged by the special cash dividend. The exercise prices and number of all outstanding options were adjusted as of the close of business on the last trading day prior to the related ex-dividend date such that each option had the same fair value to the holder before and after giving effect to the payment of the special cash dividend. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.123R, no compensation cost has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in connection with such adjustments. As a result, effective as of the close of business on December26, 2007, 2,131,556 outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $37.42 were adjusted to 2,264,535 outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $35.22, and effective as of the close of business on December26, 2006, 2,655,275 outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $39.37 were adjusted to 2,788,634 outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $37.49, and effective as of the close of business on September27, 2005, 4,325,656 outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $38.96 were adjusted to 4,481,864 outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $37.61. There were no other adjustments to the terms of the outstanding stock option awards.

In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No.157). SFAS No.157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No.157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No.157. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.157 to have a material impact on the Companys cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
133 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 (SFAS No.159).

Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.159 to have a material impact on the Companys cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ("SFAS No.141(R)"), which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No.141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008.

On June30, 1998, the Company acquired from entities controlled by Mr.AlanB. Landis, a former director, a portfolio of properties known as the Carnegie Center Portfolio and Tower Center One and related operations and development rights (collectively, the Carnegie Center Portfolio). In connection with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, the Operating Partnership entered into a development agreement (the Development Agreement) with affiliates of Mr.Landis providing for up to approximately 2,000,000 square feet of development in or adjacent to the Carnegie Center office complex. An affiliate of Mr.Landis was entitled to a purchase price for each parcel developed under the Development Agreement calculated on the basis of $20 per rentable square foot of property developed. Another affiliate of Mr.Landis was eligible to earn a contingent payment for each developed property that achieves a stabilized return in excess of a target annual return ranging between 10.5% and 11%. The Development Agreement also provided that upon negotiated terms and conditions, the Company and Mr.Landis would form a development company to provide development services for these development projects and would share the expenses and profits, if any, of this new company. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Carnegie Center Portfolio, Mr.Landis became a director of the Company pursuant to an Agreement Regarding Directorship, dated as of June30, 1998, with the Company (the Directorship Agreement). Under the Directorship Agreement, the Company agreed to nominate Mr.Landis for re-election as a director at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company in a year in which his term expires, provided that specified conditions are met.
On October21, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement (the 2004 Agreement) to modify several provisions of the Development Agreement. Under the terms of the 2004 Agreement, the Operating Partnership and affiliates of Mr.Landis amended the Development Agreement to limit the rights of Mr.Landis and his 135 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) affiliates to participate in the development of properties under the Development Agreement. Among other things, Mr.Landis agreed that (1)Mr.Landis and his affiliates will have no right to participate in any entity formed to acquire land parcels or the development company formed by the Operating Partnership to provide development services under the Development Agreement, (2)Mr.Landis will have no right or obligation to play a role in development activities engaged in by the development company formed by the Operating Partnership under the Development Agreement or receive compensation from the development company and (3)the affiliate of Mr.Landis will have no right to receive a contingent payment for developed properties based on stabilized returns. In exchange, the Company (together with the Operating Partnership) agreed to:  effective as of June30, 1998, pay Mr.Landis $125,000 on January1 of each year until the earlier of (A)January1, 2018, (B)the termination of the Development Agreement or (C)the date on which all development properties under the Development Agreement have been conveyed pursuant to the Development Agreement, with $750,000, representing payments of this annual amount from 1998 to 2004, being paid upon execution of the 2004 Agreement; and  pay an affiliate of Mr.Landis, in connection with the development of land parcels acquired under the Development Agreement, an aggregate fixed amount of $10.50 per rentable square foot of property developed (with a portion of this amount (i.e., $5.50) being subject to adjustment, in specified circumstances, based on future increases in the Consumer Price Index) in lieu of a contingent payment based on stabilized returns, which payment could have been greater or less than $10.50 per rentable square foot of property developed.
The Operating Partnership also continues to be obligated to pay an affiliate of Mr.Landis the purchase price of $20 per rentable square foot of property developed for each land parcel acquired as provided in the original Development Agreement. During the 20-year term of the Development Agreement, until such time, if any, as the Operating Partnership elects to acquire a land parcel, an affiliate of Mr.Landis will remain responsible for all carrying costs associated with such land parcel. On July24, 2007, the Company acquired from Mr.Landis 701 Carnegie Center, a land parcel located in Princeton, New Jersey for a purchase price of approximately $3.1 million with the title transferring pending subdivision approval.
In addition, in connection with entering into the 2004 Agreement, Mr.Landis resigned as a director of the Company effective as of May11, 2005 and agreed that the Company had no future obligation to nominate Mr.Landis as a director of the Company under the Directorship Agreement or otherwise. Mr.Landis did not resign because of a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices. Mitchell S. Landis, the Senior Vice President and Regional Manager of the Companys Princeton, New Jersey region, is the brother of Alan B. Landis.
In accordance with the Companys 1997 Plan, and as approved by the Board of Directors, each non-employee director has made an election to receive deferred stock units in lieu of cash fees. The deferred stock units will be settled in shares of common stock upon the cessation of such directors service on the Board of Directors. As a result of these elections, the aggregate cash fees otherwise payable to a non-employee director during a fiscal quarter are converted into a number of deferred stock units equal to the aggregate cash fees divided by the last reported sales price of a share of the Companys common stock on the last trading of the applicable fiscal quarter. The deferred stock units are also credited with dividend equivalents. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had outstanding 59,015 and 54,157 deferred stock units, respectively, with an aggregate value of approximately $3.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, which amounts are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 22.Subsequent Events On January7, 2008, the Company transferred its Mountain View, California properties to its Value-Added Fund for an aggregate of approximately $223.2 million, consisting of approximately $100.2 million of cash and a promissory note having a principal amount of $123.0 million. The note bears interest at a rate of 7%per annum and matures in April 2008, subject to extension at the option of the Value-Added Fund (with the Companys approval) until April 2009. In connection with the transfer of the Research Park and Technology Park properties to the Value-Added Fund, the Company and its partners agreed to certain modifications to the Value-Added Funds original terms, including bifurcating the Value-Added Funds promote structure such that Research Park and Technology Park will be accounted for separately from the non-Mountain View properties owned by the Value-Added Fund (i.e., Circle Star and 300 Billerica Road). As a result of the modifications, the Companys interest in the Mountain View properties is approximately 39.5% and its interest in the non-Mountain View properties is 25%. This investment completes the investment commitments from the Value-Added Fund partners.
On January24, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Company approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to officers and key employees of the Company. These awards (the 2008 OPP Awards) are part of a new broad-based, long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide the Companys management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to the Company outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if the Companys TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February5, 2008 to February5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of the Companys common stock (a REIT Share) of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8million have been allocated and will be granted on February5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants, with OPP awards exceeding a potential reward of $1 million requiring the Committees approval.
The outperformance pool will consist of (i)three percent (3%)of the excess total return above a cumulative absolute TRS hurdle of 30% over the full three-year measurement period (the Absolute TRS Component) and (ii)three percent (3%)of the excess or deficient excess total return above or below a relative TRS hurdle equal to the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index over the three-year measurement period (the Relative TRS Component). In the event that the Relative TRS Component is potentially positive because the Companys TRS is higher than the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index, but the Company achieves a cumulative absolute TRS below 30% over the three-year measurement period (equivalent to 10%per annum), the actual contribution to the outperformance pool from the Relative TRS Component will be subject to a sliding scale factor as follows: (i)100% of the potential Relative TRS Component will be earned if the Companys TRS is equal to or greater than a cumulative 30% over three years (equivalent to 10%per annum), (ii)0% will be earned if the Companys TRS is equal to or less than a cumulative 21% over three years (equivalent to 7%per annum), and (iii)a percentage from 0% to 100% calculated by linear interpolation will be earned if the Companys cumulative TRS over three years is between 21% and 30%. The potential Relative TRS Component before application of the sliding scale factor will be capped at $110 million (or such lesser amount as corresponds to the OPP awards actually granted). In the event that the Relative TRS Component is negative because the Companys TRS is less than the total return of the SNL Equity REIT Index, any outperformance reward potentially earned under the Absolute TRS Component will be reduced dollar for dollar, provided that the potential Absolute TRS Component 137 Table of Contents BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) before reduction for any negative Relative TRS Component will be capped at $110 million (or such lesser amount as corresponds to the OPP awards actually granted). The algebraic sum of the Absolute TRS Component and the Relative TRS Component determined as described above will never exceed $110 million (or such lesser amount as corresponds to the OPP awards actually granted).
Each employees 2008 OPP Award will be designated as a specified percentage of the aggregate outperformance pool. Assuming the applicable absolute and/or relative TRS thresholds are achieved at the end of the measurement period, the algebraic sum of the Absolute TRS Component and the Relative TRS Component will be calculated and then allocated among the 2008 OPP Award recipients in accordance with each individuals percentage. Rewards earned with respect to 2008 OPP Awards will vest 25% on February5, 2011, 25% on February5, 2012, and 50% on February5, 2013, based on continued employment. Vesting will be accelerated in the event of a change of control of the Company, termination of employment by the Company without cause, termination of employment by the award recipient for good reason, death, disability or retirement, although restrictions on transfer will continue to apply in certain of these situations. 2008 OPP Awards will be in the form of LTIP units of limited partnership interest of the Operating Partnership. LTIP Units were issued prior to the determination of the outperformance pool, but will remain subject to forfeiture depending on the extent of rewards earned with respect to 2008 OPP Awards. The number of LTIP Units issued initially to recipients of the 2008 OPP Awards was an estimate of the maximum number of LTIP Units that they could earn, based on certain assumptions. The number of LTIP Units actually earned by each award recipient will be determined at the end of the performance measurement period by dividing his or her share of the outperformance pool by the average closing price of a REIT Share for the 15 trading days immediately preceding the measurement date. Total return for the Company and for the SNL Equity REIT Index over the three-year measurement period and other circumstances will determine how many LTIP Units are earned by each recipient; if they are fewer than the number issued initially, the balance will be forfeited as of the performance measurement date. Prior to the measurement date, LTIP units issued on account of 2008 OPP Awards will be entitled to receive per unit distributions equal to one-tenth (10%)of the regular quarterly distributions payable on a common unit of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, but will not be entitled to receive any special distributions. After the measurement date, the number of LTIP Units, both vested and unvested, which 2008 OPP Award recipients have earned based on the establishment of an outperformance pool, will be entitled to receive distributions in an amount per unit equal to distributions, both regular and special, payable on a Common Unit.
On January29, 2008, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity that owns and is developing the office component of the project (the Office Entity) (a joint venture entity in which the Company owns a 66.67% interest) obtained construction financing totaling $115.0 million collateralized by the office property. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use development project consisting of office, retail and residential properties located in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

On January29, 2008, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity that owns and is developing the land and infrastructure components of the project (the Land and Infrastructure Entity) (a joint venture entity in which the Company owns an effective interest of approximately 23.89%) executed a second amendment to its construction loan agreement. The construction financing consisted of a $69.1 million commitment, bearing interest at a per annum variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% and maturing on March11, 2009. The outstanding balance on the construction loan was approximately $52.6 million on the $69.1 million commitment. The amended agreement provides for a reduction in the loan commitment amount to $36.9 million. The reduction relates to the repayment of the office portion of the outstanding balance totaling approximately $24.9 million and an additional reduction in the borrowing capacity of approximately $7.3 million with a corresponding release of collateral in conjunction with the Office Entity obtaining new construction financing.
