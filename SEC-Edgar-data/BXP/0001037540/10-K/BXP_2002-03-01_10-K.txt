Business General As used herein, the terms "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" refer to Boston Properties,Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1997, individually or together with its subsidiaries, including Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and our predecessors. We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust or "REIT" and one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in four core marketsBoston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan and San Francisco. We conduct substantially all of our business through Boston Properties Limited Partnership. At December31, 2001, we owned 147 properties, totaling 40.7million net rentable square feet. Our properties consisted of 139 office properties, comprised of 107 ClassA office buildings and 32properties that support both office and technical uses, including twelve properties under construction, five industrial properties and three hotels. We consider ClassA office buildings to be centrally located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings.
We have a $605million unsecured revolving line of credit with Fleet National Bank, as agent, which expires in March2003. As of February28, 2002, there were no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit. You should refer to "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information regarding our unsecured revolving line of credit and our other indebtedness.
We are a full service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, tax and legal services. As of December31, 2001, we had over 675 employees. Our 29 senior officers, together with Mr.Mortimer Zuckerman, Chairman of our board of directors, have an average of 24years experience in the real estate industry and an average of 14years tenure with us. Our principal executive office is located at 111 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and its telephone number is (617)236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 401 9 th Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20004; 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022; Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111; and 502 Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.
Boston Properties Limited Partnership Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, is the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of our assets. We are the sole general partner and, as of February28, 2002, the owner of approximately 75.0% of the economic interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT or "UPREIT". Our general and limited partnership interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership entitle us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, Boston Properties Limited Partnership in proportion to our percentage interest therein and entitle us to vote on all matters requiring a vote of the limited partners. The other partners of Boston Properties Limited Partnership are persons who contributed their direct or indirect interests in certain properties to Boston Properties Limited Partnership in exchange for common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership or preferred units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of Boston Properties Limited Partnership unitholders may tender their common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership for cash equal to the value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock. In lieu of delivering cash, however, we may, at our 1 option, choose to acquire any units so tendered by issuing common stock in exchange for the units. Our common stock will be exchanged for units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio may be adjusted to prevent dilution. We currently anticipate that we will elect to issue our common stock in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having Boston Properties Limited Partnership pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, our percentage ownership in Boston Properties Limited Partnership will increase. In addition, whenever we issue shares of our common stock other than to acquire common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, we must contribute any net proceeds we receive to Boston Properties Limited Partnership and Boston Properties Limited Partnership must issue to us an equivalent number of common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership.
Preferred units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership have the rights, preferences and other privileges (including the right to convert into common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership) as are set forth in amendments to the limited partnership agreement of Boston Properties Limited Partnership. As of February28, 2002, Boston Properties Limited Partnership had four series of its preferred units outstanding (excluding preferred units held by Boston Properties,Inc.). The Series One preferred units had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $85million at issuance and bear a preferred distribution at a rate of 7.25% per annum, payable quarterly. Series One units are convertible into common units at the rate of $38.25 per common unit at the holder's election at any time. At December31, 2001, $0.6million of Series One units had been converted into common units. We also have the right to convert into common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership all or part of the Series One units on or after June3, 2003, if our common stock at the time of our election is trading at a price of at least $42.08 per share.
The Series Two and Series Three preferred units, which together have an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $311million, have, between each other, similar economic terms. On and after December31, 2002, the Series Two and Series Three units will be convertible, at the holder's election, into common units at a conversion price of $38.10 per common unit. Distributions on the Series Two and Series Three units are payable quarterly and generally accrue at rates of: 6.0% through December31, 2001; 6.5% through December31, 2002; 7.0% until May12, 2009; and 6.0% thereafter. The terms of the Series Two and Series Three units provide that they may be redeemed for cash in six annual tranches, beginning on May12, 2009, at the election of us or the holders. We also have the right to convert into common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership any Series Two and Series Three units that are not redeemed when they are entitled to redemption.
The SeriesZ preferred units have an aggregate liquidation preference of the greater of the value of our common stock or $37.25 per share of our common stock. The SeriesZ units were not entitled to receive any distributions until after August11, 2001. From August11, 2001 until February11, 2002, each SeriesZ unit entitled its holder to receive one-half of any distributions paid on a common unit. After February11, 2002, each SeriesZ unit entitled its holder to receive an amount equal to 100% of any distributions paid on a common unit. The SeriesZ units will automatically convert into common units on the effective date of the registration statement on FormS-3 that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February11, 2002. The registration statement was filed to register the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable in exchange for the common units into which the SeriesZ units are convertible.
Real Estate Acquisitions/Dispositions during 2001 On February13, 2001, the Company acquired a 4.3-acre parcel of land at 77 Fourth Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts for cash of approximately $13.0million. This site will support an approximately 202,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office building.
2 On March30, 2001, the Company disposed of 25-33 Dartmouth Street in Westwood, Massachusetts, an industrial building totaling approximately 78,000 net rentable square feet. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $6.6million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $4.7million (net of minority interest share of approximately $1.1million).
On April25, 2001, the Company closed on the acquisition of the approximately 1.6million net rentable square foot office tower in midtown Manhattan known as Citigroup Center. The acquisition was completed through a venture with a third party private real estate investment company. The total acquisition cost of approximately $755million, was funded through new mortgage financing totaling $525million, cash contributed to purchase equity in the acquiring entity of $195million from Boston Properties Limited Partnership and the balance from the third party private real estate investment company. Our $195million equity investment will earn a priority return of 10% per annum for ten years. The preferred equity and any accumulated unpaid portion of the priority return on our equity investment will be payable before the third party affiliate receives a return on its common interest. Financial results of this venture are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company controls the entity that owns the property.
On June29, 2001, the Company disposed of Maryland Industrial Park, Buildings Two and Three, consisting of two industrial buildings totaling approximately 184,000 net rentable square feet, for net proceeds of approximately $7.6million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $1.9million (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.4million).
On November8, 2001, the Company disposed of a parcel of land known as the Belvedere Condominium/Retail Project located at the Prudential Center in Boston, Massachusetts for net proceeds of approximately $11million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $2.3million (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.5million.) On November29, 2001, the Company acquired an approximately 22-acre parcel of land in Reston, Virginia for approximately $8.6million. This site will support an approximately 358,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office building.
On December19, 2001, the Company acquired a 74-acre parcel of land in Weston, Massachusetts for cash of approximately $18million, which includes a deposit made in 2000 of approximately $9million. This site will support an approximately 350,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office building.

Stock Repurchases On September14, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program under which we are permitted to purchase up to $100million of our outstanding common stock. From that date through February28, 2002, we purchased 78,900 shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $2.7million. As a result, we have authorization to repurchase up to an additional $97.3million of our outstanding common stock, which we may repurchase from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on market prices and other conditions. The authority granted by the Board of Directors may, in the discretion of our senior management, be exercised form time to time and in such amounts as market conditions warrant.
Business and Growth Strategies Business Strategy Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment so as to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return. Our strategy to achieve this objective is:  to concentrate on a few carefully selected markets and to be one of, if not the leading, owner and developer in each of those markets. We select markets and submarkets where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high quality office buildings and other facilities;  to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where there are barriers to the creation of new supply and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop and manage high quality office, research and development and/or industrial space;  to take on complex, technically challenging projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties which other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;  to concentrate on high quality, state-of-the-art real estate designed to meet the demands of today's knowledge-based tenants and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients; and  to opportunistically acquire assets which increase our penetration in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate and which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning, changes in management focus and re-leasing as existing leases terminate.
4 Growth Strategies External Growth We believe that we are well positioned to realize significant growth through external asset development and acquisition. We believe that our development experience and our organizational depth position us to continue to develop a range of property types, from single-story suburban office properties to high-rise urban developments, within budget and on schedule. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:  our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our core markets that will support approximately 9.7million square feet of new office, hotel and residential development;  our reputation gained through the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;  our relationships with leading national corporations and public institutions seeking new facilities and development services;  our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry; and  the substantial amount of commercial real estate owned by domestic and foreign institutions, private investors, and corporations who are seeking to sell these assets in our market areas.
We have targeted three areas of development and acquisition as significant opportunities to execute our external growth strategy:  Pursue development in selected submarkets.
We believe that development of well-positioned office buildings will continue to be justified in many of our submarkets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles, and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers to entry, we have demonstrated over our 30year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential at key locations.
In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government approval regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development, and profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek out complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to significantly enhanced returns on investment.
Acquire assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals.
We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are in an advantageous position to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals. We may acquire properties for cash, but we believe that we are particularly well positioned to appeal to sellers wishing to convert on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property to the ownership of equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets. In addition, we may pursue mergers with and acquisitions of compatible real estate firms. Our ability to offer units in Boston Properties Limited Partnership to sellers who would otherwise recognize a gain upon a sale of assets for cash or our common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax-efficient basis.
5  Acquire existing underperforming assets and portfolios of assets . We continue to actively pursue opportunities to acquire existing buildings that, while currently generating income, are either underperforming the market due to poor management or are currently leased at below market rents with anticipated roll-over of space. These opportunities may include the acquisition of entire portfolios of properties. We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies and responsive property management program.
Internal Growth We believe that significant opportunities exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties because they are of high quality and in desirable locations. In addition, our properties are in markets where, in general, the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development on vacant land. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is two-fold: (1)to provide high quality property management services using our own employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, and (2)to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation, and design and construction of tenant improvements. In addition, we believe that once normal market conditions return, our hotel properties will add to our internal growth because of their desirable locations in the downtown Boston and East Cambridge submarkets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to:  Cultivate existing submarkets.
In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.
Based on leases in place at December31, 2001, leases with respect to 4.1% of our ClassA office buildings will expire in calendar year 2002. We believe that leases, on average, expiring over the next three years in these submarkets may be renewed, or space re-let, at higher or the same rents than previously in effect.
Directly manage properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention.
We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations. Our philosophy has not been to invest significant capital in technology, but to form alliances to provide better tenant service and realize potential incremental revenues with little additional capital investment.
Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs . We believe that we have a competitive advantage in attracting new tenants and achieving rental rates at the higher end of our markets as a result of our well located, well designed and well maintained properties, our reputation for high quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets.
The Hotel Properties Under the REIT requirements, revenues from a hotel are not considered to be rental income for purposes of certain income tests, which a REIT must meet. Accordingly, since 1997, in order to 6 maintain our qualification as a REIT, we have leased our three hotel properties to ZL Hotel LLC pursuant to a lease that entitles Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as lessor, to a percentage of the gross receipts of our hotel properties. Mr.Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the Chairman of our board of directors, and Edward H. Linde, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are the sole member-managers of, and have a 9.8% economic interest in, ZL Hotel LLC; two unaffiliated public charities own the remaining 90.2% economic interest. Marriott International,Inc. manages our hotel properties under the Marriott name pursuant to a management agreement with ZL Hotel LLC.
During 2002, subject to obtaining required consents and in conjunction with the expiration of most of the existing leases, we intend to modify the current lease structure with respect to our three hotels to take advantage of the taxable REIT subsidiary structure. We expect that, following the restructuring, Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as lessor, will continue to be entitled to a percentage of the gross receipts of our hotel properties and that Marriott International,Inc. will continue to manage our hotel properties under the Marriott name pursuant to a management contract with the lessee.
Competition We compete in the leasing of office and industrial space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources. In addition, our hotel properties compete for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and Marriott International,Inc.
Seasonality Our hotel properties traditionally have experienced significant seasonality in their operating income, with weighted average net operating income by quarter over the three years 1999 through 2001 as follows: First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 15 % 28 % 27 % 30 % Our other properties have not traditionally experienced significant seasonality.
7 RISK FACTORS Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders. We refer to the shares of our common and preferred stock and the units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership together as our "securities," and the investors who own shares and/or units as our "securityholders." This section includes or refers to certain forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward-looking statements beginning on page27.
Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our office, industrial, and hotel properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the revenues generated by our office, industrial, and hotel properties:  downturns in the national, regional and local economic climate;  competition from other office, industrial, hotel and other commercial buildings;  local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, industrial, hotel or other commercial space;  changes in interest rates and availability of financing;  vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and relet space;  increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes, and heightened security costs;  civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;  significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property; and  ability to collect rents from tenants.
We are dependent upon the economic climates of our four core marketsBoston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan and San Francisco.
A majority of our revenues are derived from properties located in our four core markets-Boston, Washington, D.C., midtown Manhattan and San Francisco. As a result of the current slowdown in economic activity, there has been an increase in vacancy rates for office properties in all of these four markets. A prolonged downturn in the economies of these core markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in further reduced demand for office space. Because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results from operations. Additionally, there are submarkets within our core markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries and a significant downturn in one or more of these industries could also adversely affect our results from operations.
8 Our investment in property development may be more costly than anticipated.
We have a significant development pipeline and intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office, industrial and hotel properties. Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:  we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing with favorable terms;  we may incur construction costs for a development project which exceed our original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other costs, which could make completion of the project uneconomical because we may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;  we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;  we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may fail to recover expenses already incurred;  we may expend funds on and devote management's time to projects which we do not complete;  we may be unable to complete construction and leasing of a property on schedule, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction or renovation costs;  we may lease developed properties at below expected rental rates; and  occupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investment not being profitable.
Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
We intend to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of this structure. The use of a joint venture vehicle creates a risk of a dispute with our joint venturers and a risk that we will have to acquire a joint venturer's interest in a development for a price at which or at a time when we would otherwise not purchase such interest. Our joint venture partners may have different objectives from us regarding the appropriate timing and pricing of any sale or refinancing of properties.
In 2000, we entered into a joint venture with the New York State Common Retirement Fund which has agreed to contribute up to $270million to acquire and develop properties with us. During the three-year term of this joint venture, the New York State Common Retirement Fund has the right to participate in all of our acquisition opportunities that meet agreed criteria and any development projects that we choose to pursue with an institutional partner.
We face risks associated with property acquisitions.
Since our initial public offering, we have made large acquisitions of properties and portfolios of properties. We intend to continue to acquire properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could continue to significantly increase our size and alter our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks:  we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and institutional investment funds; 9  even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, it is usually subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction;  even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;  we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms;  acquired properties may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investments;  our estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be inaccurate;  acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if liability were asserted against us based upon those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include:  liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;  claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties;  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and  claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.
We derive most of our income from rent received from our tenants. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants decide to renew, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms. As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.
We face potential adverse effects from major tenants' bankruptcies or insolvencies.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. Although we have not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies in the past, our tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results from operations.
10 We may have difficulty selling our properties which may limit our flexibility.
Large and high quality office, industrial and hotel properties like the ones that we own can be hard to sell, especially if local market conditions are poor. This may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties that we have owned for fewer than four years, and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our properties face significant competition.
We face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office, industrial and other commercial real estate. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. Such competition may effect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to make space available at lower prices than the space in our properties.
Because we own three hotel properties, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.
We own three hotel properties. We currently lease these hotel properties to ZL Hotel LLC, in which Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of our board of directors, and Edward H. Linde, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are the sole member-managers and have a 9.8% economic interest; two unaffiliated public charities have a 90.2% economic interest in ZL Hotel LLC. Marriott International,Inc. manages these hotel properties under the Marriott name pursuant to a management agreement with ZL Hotel LLC. ZL Hotel LLC pays Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as lessor, a percentage of the gross receipts that the hotel properties receive. During 2002, we intend to modify this lease structure to take advantage of the taxable REIT subsidiary structure. We expect that following the restructuring Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as lessor, will continue to be entitled to a percentage of the gross receipts of our hotel properties and Marriott International,Inc. will continue to manage our hotel properties under the Marriott name pursuant to a management contract with the lessee.
Because the lease payments we receive under the current leases, and those that we will receive under the new leases, are based on a participation in the gross receipts of the hotels, if the hotels do not generate sufficient receipts, our cash flow would be decreased, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders. The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel properties:  our hotel properties compete for guests with other hotels, a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;  if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;  our hotel properties are subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism;  our hotel properties are subject to general and local economic conditions that may affect demand for travel in general; and  we cannot predict the magnitude and duration of the decline in business and vacation travel in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September11, 2001, which has adversely affected the revenues and cash flow from our hotels.
11 Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws could result in substantial costs.
The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including office buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.
We may also incur significant costs complying with other regulations. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all of these regulatory requirements. However, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results from operations.
Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
We carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. We believe all of our properties are adequately insured. The property insurance that we maintain for our properties has historically been on an "all risk" basis, including losses caused by acts of terrorism. However, following the recent terrorist activity of September11, 2001, and in light of the resulting uncertainty in the insurance market, many insurance companies have indicated that they will exclude insurance against acts of terrorism from their "all risk" policies. Our "all risk" insurance coverage in place for the current policy year contains specific exclusions for losses attributable to acts of terrorism. The cost and limited availability of specific third party insurance coverage for losses from acts of terrorism have made it commercially unreasonable for us to secure such coverage at this time. Therefore, we do not now have and cannot predict whether or when we will be able to obtain and maintain insurance protection against acts of terrorism. Further, there are other types of losses, such as from wars or catastrophic acts of nature, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. In the event of an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance limits, we could lose both the revenues generated from the affected property and the capital we have invested in the affected property; depending on the specific circumstances of the affected property it is possible that we could be liable for any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.
We carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to deductibles and self-insurance that we believe are commercially reasonable. However, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. As a result of increased costs of coverage and decreased availability, the amount of third party earthquake insurance we have been able to purchase in the marketplace upon commercially reasonable terms has been reduced. In addition, we may discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results from operations.
12 Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.
Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties, regardless of our knowledge or responsibility, simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders because:  as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination;  the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination;  even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and  governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.
These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination.
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:  properly manage and maintain the asbestos;  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and  undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.
Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our properties are located in urban, industrial and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination.
It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead in drinking water, for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usages create a potential environmental problem, and for contamination in groundwater. Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that:  the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities; 13  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and  future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.
We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.
We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow will not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant "balloon" payments come due.
Rising interest rates would increase our interest costs.
We currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which would adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to service debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. As a protection against rising interest rates, we enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange contracts. These agreements, however, increase our risks as to other parties to the agreements not performing or that the agreements could be unenforceable.
We have no corporate limitation on the amount of debt we can incur.
Our management and board of directors have discretion under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to increase the amount of our outstanding debt. Our decisions with regard to the incurrence and maintenance of debt are based on available investment opportunities for which capital is required, the cost of debt in relation to such investment opportunities, whether secured or unsecured debt is available, the effect of additional debt on existing financial ratios and the maturity of the proposed new debt relative to maturities of existing debt. We could become more highly leveraged, resulting in increased debt service costs that could adversely affect our cash flow and the amount available for payment of dividends. If we increase our debt we may also increase the risk we will be unable to repay our debt.
Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.
The mortgages on our properties contain customary negative covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our credit facilities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to assets ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt which we must maintain. Our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants.
Our current year's insurance policies contain an exclusion for acts of terrorism and some of our lenders may take the position that our insurance coverage no longer complies with covenants in our 14 debt agreements. If a lender takes this position, they may attempt to claim an event of default under the applicable debt agreement. Additionally, in the future our ability to obtain debt financing secured by individual properties, or the terms of such financing, may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon insurance against acts of terrorism and such coverage is not available upon commercially reasonable terms.
We rely on borrowings under our credit facilities to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital, and if we are unable to borrow under our credit facilities, or to refinance existing indebtedness our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely impacted. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lender can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the loan. In addition, our credit facilities are cross-defaulted to our other indebtedness, which would give the lenders under our credit facilities the right also to declare a default.
Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock.
Debt to Market Capitalization Ratio is a measure of our total debt as a percentage of the aggregate of our total debt plus the market value of our outstanding common stock and interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Our Debt to Market Capitalization Ratio was approximately 47.7% as of December31, 2001. To the extent that our board of directors uses our Debt to Market Capitalization Ratio as a measure of appropriate leverage, the total amount of our debt could increase as our common stock price increases, even if we may not have a corresponding increase in our ability to service or repay the debt. Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our Debt to Market Capitalization Ratio, which is in parta function of our stock price, or our ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.
The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments and acquisitions instead of incurring additional debt. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.
Failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.
If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we will be taxed as a corporation. We believe that we are organized and qualified as a real estate investment trust, and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
15 If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:  we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;  unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a real estate investment trust for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and  all dividends will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
In addition, if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we will no longer be required to pay dividends. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of our common stock.
In order to maintain our real estate investment trust status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.
In order to maintain our real estate investment trust status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements, even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. To qualify as a real estate investment trust, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding capital gains. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We may need short-term debt to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments.
Limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Delaware corporate law, may:  delay or prevent a change of control over us or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to our stockholders; and  limit our stockholders' opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.
16 Stock Ownership Limit Primarily to facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a real estate investment trust, our certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity stock. We refer to this limitation as the "ownership limit." Our board of directors may waive or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. In addition, under our certificate of incorporation each of Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde, along with their respective families and affiliates, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity common stock. Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.
Boston Properties Limited Partnership Agreement We have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of Boston Properties Limited Partnership not to engage in business combinations unless limited partners of Boston Properties Limited Partnership other than Boston Properties,Inc. receive, or have the opportunity to receive, the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of our common stock in the transaction. If these limited partners do not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless 75% of these limited partners vote to approve the transaction. In addition, we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of Boston Properties Limited Partnership that we will not consummate business combinations in which we received the approval of our stockholders unless these limited partners are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as stockholders on the transaction. Therefore, if our stockholders approve a business combination that requires a vote of stockholders, the partnership agreement requires the following before we can consummate the transaction:  holders of interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership (including Boston Properties,Inc.) must vote on the matter;  Boston Properties,Inc. must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as our stockholders voted on the transaction; and  the result of the vote of holders of interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.
As a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal and we may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed business combination even though our stockholders approve of the combination.
Shareholder Rights Plan We have adopted a shareholder rights plan. Under the terms of this plan, we can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, because, unless we approve of the acquisition, after the person acquires more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value, which would substantially reduce the value and influence of the stock owned by the acquiring person. Our board of directors can prevent the plan from operating by approving of the transaction, which gives us significant power to approve or disapprove of the efforts of a person or group to acquire a large interest in our company.
17 We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.
Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are determined by our board of directors. Accordingly, as a stockholder, you will have little direct control over these policies.
Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
We depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman of our board of directors, and Edward H. Linde, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Among the reasons that Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde are important to our success is that each has a national reputation which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential tenants and industry personnel would diminish.
Our other executive officers who serve as managers of our offices have strong regional reputations. Their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely effect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective tenants and industry personnel.
Mr.Zuckerman has substantial outside business interests, including serving as a trustee for New York University, a trustee of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute, a trustee of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He is currently serving as the Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations. He is also Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of U.S. News& World Report, Chairman and Co-Publisher of the New York Daily News and Chairman of the Board of Applied Graphics Technologies. He is a member of the Chase Manhattan Corporation National Advisory Board, and a member of the Board of Directors of Loews Cineplex and WNET/Channel Thirteen. Such outside business interests could interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs. Over the last twenty years, Mr.Zuckerman has devoted a significant portion, although not a majority, of his business time to the affairs of Boston Properties and its predecessors. We have no assurance that he will continue to devote any specific portion of his time to us, although at present, he has no commitments which would prevent him from maintaining his current level of involvement with our business.
Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership.
Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership than on our stockholders.
Some holders of interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership, including Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde, would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to us and our stockholders. Consequently, such holders of interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While we have exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of Boston Properties Limited Partnership to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of our board of directors. As directors and executive officers, Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde have substantial influence with respect to any such decision. Their influence could be exercised in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of our stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.
18 Agreement not to sell some properties.
Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer some of our properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income, without first obtaining the consent of Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde. However, we are not required to obtain their consent if, during the applicable period, each of them does not hold at least 30% of his original interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership. In addition, we have entered into similar agreements with respect to other properties that we have acquired in exchange for interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership. As of December31, 2001, there were a total of 36 properties subject to these restrictions, and those 36 properties are estimated to have accounted for approximately 59% of our total revenue for the year ended December31, 2001.
Boston Properties Limited Partnership has also entered into agreements providing Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde and others with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. These agreements may hinder actions that we may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because we would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if we violate these agreements.
Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde will continue to engage in other activities.
Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde have a broad and varied range of investment interests. Either one could acquire an interest in a company which is not currently involved in real estate investment activities but which may acquire real property in the future. However, pursuant to Mr.Linde's employment agreement and Mr.Zuckerman's non-compete agreement, Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde will not, in general, have management control over such companies and, therefore, they may not be able to prevent one or more such companies from engaging in activities that are in competition with our activities.
Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following:  the extent of investor interest in us;  the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;  our financial performance; and  general stock and bond market conditions.
The market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share of common stock. If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish.
Market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our common stock.
One of the factors that investors may consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a real estate investment trust is the dividend with respect to such real estate investment trust's shares as a percentage of the price of such shares, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates go 19 up, prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock may expect a higher distribution rate on our common stock. Higher market interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for us to distribute and, to the contrary, would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common stock to go down.
The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.
As part of our initial public offering and since then we have completed many private placement transactions where shares of capital stock of Boston Properties,Inc. or interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. This common stock, or common stock issuable on conversion of our preferred stock or in exchange for such interests in Boston Properties Limited Partnership, may be sold in the public securities markets over time pursuant to registration rights we granted to these investors. Additional common stock reserved under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including stock options, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. Future sales of our common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of our common stock.
We did not obtain new owner's title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during our initial public offering.
We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of our initial public offering in June1997. Before we acquired these properties each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. We did not, however, obtain new owner's title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of such properties. Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity which owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current values of the applicable properties. If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of our initial public offering, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property.
We have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after our initial public offering.
We face possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws.
Generally, we pass through to our tenants costs resulting from increases in real estate taxes. However, we generally do not pass through to our tenants increases in income, service or transfer taxes. Similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on our properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures. These increased costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends.
20 Item 2.
Properties At December31, 2001, our portfolio consisted of 147 properties totaling 40.7million net rentable square feet. Our properties consisted of 139 office properties, including 107 ClassA office buildings and 32properties that support both office and technical uses, including twelve properties under construction, five industrial properties, and three hotels. In addition, we own or control 44 parcels of land for future development.

During 1999, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts clarified the definition of funds from operations to include non-recurring events, except for those that are defined as "extraordinary items" under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties. This clarification is effective for periods ending subsequent to January1, 2000. We adopted this definition for the quarters ended on or after March31, 2000. We believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flow from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs. We compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts which may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition or that interpret the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition differently. In addition to Funds from Operations (as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts), we also disclose Funds from Operations after certain supplemental adjustments. Funds from Operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. For a reconciliation of income to funds from operations see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFunds from Operations." 26 Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the historical consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes thereto.
Forward Looking Statements Statements made under the caption "Risk Factors," elsewhere in this Form10-K, in our press releases, and in oral statements we make by or with the approval of our authorized executives contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of federal securities laws. When we use the words "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend" and other similar expressions, they generally identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, for example, statements relating to acquisitions and related financial information, development activities, business strategy and prospects, future capital expenditures, sources and availability of capital, environmental and other regulations, and competition.
You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control and could materially affect our actual results, performance or achievements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:  we are subject to general risks affecting the real estate industry, such as the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms to generate rental revenues, and dependence on our tenants' financial condition;  we may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties; we may develop properties that do not produce a desired yield on invested capital; or we may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties;  financing may not be available, or may not be available on favorable terms;  we need to make distributions to our stockholders for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, and if we need to borrow the funds to make such distributions such borrowings may not be available on favorable terms;  we depend on the primary markets where our properties are located and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control;  we are subject to potential environmental liabilities;  we are subject to complex regulations relating to our status as a real estate investment trust and would be adversely affected if we failed to qualify as a real estate investment trust; and  market interest rates could adversely affect the market prices for our common stock, as well as our performance and cash flow.
We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Overview We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust or "REIT" and are one of the largest owners and developers of office and industrial properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in four core marketsBoston, Washington, D.C., 27 midtown Manhattan and San Francisco. We conduct substantially all of our business through Boston Properties Limited Partnership. At December31, 2001, we owned 147 properties totaling 40.7million net rentable square feet. The properties consisted of 139 office properties, including 107 ClassA office buildings and 32 properties that support both office and technical uses, including twelve properties under construction, five industrial properties, and three hotels.
In 2001, we continued to identify and complete acquisitions and development transactions. During 2001, we added 2.6million net rentable square feet to our portfolio by completing an acquisition totaling approximately $755.0million and completing developments totaling approximately $168.0million. In addition, as of December31, 2001, we had construction in progress representing a total anticipated investment of approximately $1.8billion and a total of approximately 4.9million net rentable square feet.
We are focused on increasing the cash flow from our existing portfolio of properties by maintaining high occupancy levels and increasing effective rents. On the 2.7million net rentable square feet of second generation space renewed or re-leased during the year, new net rents were on average approximately 49.2% higher than the expiring net rents. At December31 2001, our in-service portfolio was 95.3% occupied.
Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.
We receive income primarily from rental revenue from our office, hotel, parking and industrial properties, including reimbursements from certain tenants for certain operating costs.
From January1, 1999 through December31, 2001, we increased our total portfolio of properties from 121 properties to 147 properties and from 31.6million net rentable square feet to 40.7million net rentable square feet. As a result of this rapid growth of our total portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period and we do not believe our period to period financial data are comparable. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 show changes resulting from properties that we owned for each period compared (we refer to this comparison as our "Same Property Portfolio" for the applicable period) and the changes attributable to our total portfolio.
Comparison of the year ended December31, 2001 to the year ended December31, 2000 The table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the 113 buildings acquired or placed in service on or prior to January1, 2000 and that remained in the total portfolio 28 through December31, 2001 (which constitute the Same Property Portfolio for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000): Same Property Portfolio Total Portfolio 2001 2000 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2001 2000 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change (Dollars in Thousands) Revenue: Rental $ 892,466 $ 821,695 $ 70,771 8.61 % $ 1,007,610 $ 858,942 $ 148,668 17.31 % Development and management services     13,190 11,837 1,353 11.43 % Interest and other     12,178 8,574 3,604 42.03 % Total revenue 892,466 821,695 70,771 8.61 % 1,032,978 879,353 153,625 17.47 % Expenses: Operating 279,234 255,498 23,736 9.29 % 312,294 264,701 47,593 17.98 % General and administrative     38,312 35,659 2,653 7.44 % Interest     223,389 217,064 6,325 2.91 % Depreciation and amortization 130,998 127,679 3,319 2.60 % 150,163 133,150 17,013 12.78 % Loss on investments in securities     6,500  6,500  Unconsolidated joint venture income     4,186 1,758 2,428 138.11 % Total expenses 410,232 383,177 27,055 7.06 % 734,844 652,332 82,512 12.65 % Income before minority interests and net derivative losses $ 482,234 $ 438,518 $ 43,716 9.97 % $ 298,134 $ 227,021 $ 71,113 31.32 % The increase in rental revenue in our Same Property Portfolio is primarily a result of an overall increase in rental rates on new leases and rollovers, an increase in reimbursable operating expenses as well as an increase in termination fees and early surrender income offset by a decrease in occupancy from year to year. Rental revenue is comprised of base rent, including termination fees and early surrender income, recoveries from tenants and parking and other. Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income represents the amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements. Straight line rent for the year ended December31, 2001 was $28.0million compared to $13.1million for the year ended December31, 2000. Termination fees and early surrender income increased from $3.7million for the year ended December31, 2000 to $21.6million for the year ended December31, 2001. Included in the $21.6million is $12.4million related to the early surrender of space of a tenant at 875 Third Avenue, of which approximately $9.2million has been received to date. We expect to receive the remaining amount on a monthly basis through July2002. The occupancy for our Same Property Portfolio decreased from 98.9% as of December31, 2000 to 95.8% as of December31, 2001. Additional increases in rental revenues in our total portfolio are primarily the result of rental revenues earned on properties we acquired or placed in service after January1, 2000 offset by a decrease in overall occupancy from 98.9% to 95.3%.
The Company has not recognized $0.4million of rental revenue during the year ended December31, 2001, related to a tenant who has filed for bankruptcy. Although the tenant vacated the space during 2001, the rental payments, to the extent the space is not re-let, are guaranteed by a third party. Revenue of approximately $0.2million per month relating to this space will be recognized, when and if, collection is reasonably assured.
The increase in development and management services income in our total portfolio is mainly due to an increase in development and management income earned on contracts starting in 2001 and 2000 and an increase of approximately $0.4million of work order profits earned on the entire portfolio. This was offset by certain management and development contracts ending in 2000 and some reductions in charges for management fees.
29 The increase in interest and other income in our total portfolio is primarily due to more interest earned as a result of higher average cash balances in 2001 resulting from the remaining proceeds from the public offering in October2000 offset by lower interest rates.
Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in our Same Property Portfolio increased mainly due to increases in real estate taxes of $6.0million, or 2.3%, and increases in utilities of $7.4million, or 2.9%. Most office leases include reimbursement for these operating expenses. The increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to higher property tax assessments. Small increases in the other property operating expenses account for the remaining difference. Additional increases in property operating expenses in our total portfolio were due to properties we acquired or placed in service after January1, 2000.
General and administrative expenses in our total portfolio increased mainly due to an overall increase in payroll due to an increase in the overall size of our total portfolio and the number of employees since January1, 2000 as well as salary increases to employees. We wrote off $1.4million of abandoned projects in 2001 compared to a $0.7million write-off in 2000. In addition, the 2001 expense does not include $3.0million that was included in the prior year related to the departure of two senior employees.
Interest expense for our total portfolio increased as a result of having a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior period. Our debt outstanding at December31, 2001 was approximately $4.3billion, compared to $3.4billion at December31, 2000. This was partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rates over the year from 7.37% at December31, 2000 to 6.57% at December31, 2001.
Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000 were $6.5million and $5.0million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000 was $59.3million and $37.7million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense discussed above.
Depreciation and amortization expense for our Same Property Portfolio increased as a result of capital and tenant improvements made during 2001. Additional increases in depreciation and amortization expense for our total portfolio were mainly due to the properties we acquired or placed in service after January1, 2000 and related capital and tenant improvements.
Unconsolidated joint venture income increased as a result of income earned on joint venture properties being placed in service during 2001 and income earned on joint venture properties acquired after January1, 2000.
We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence, but do not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40years.
Comparison of the year ended December31, 2000 to the year ended December31, 1999 The table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the 106 buildings acquired or placed in service on or prior to January1, 1999 and that remained in the total portfolio 30 through December31, 2000 (which constitute the Same Property Portfolio for the years ended December31, 2000 and 1999): Same Property Portfolio Total Portfolio 2000 1999 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2000 1999 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change (Dollars in Thousands) Revenue: Rental $ 766,141 $ 717,654 $ 48,487 6.76 % $ 858,942 $ 765,417 $ 93,525 12.22 % Development and management services     11,837 14,708 (2,871 ) (19.52 )% Interest and other     8,574 6,439 2,135 33.16 % Total revenue 766,141 717,654 48,487 6.76 % 879,353 786,564 92,789 11.80 % Expenses: Operating 237,107 230,178 6,929 3.01 % 264,701 249,268 15,433 6.19 % General and administrative     35,659 29,455 6,204 21.06 % Interest     217,064 205,410 11,654 5.67 % Depreciation and amortization 117,863 112,463 5,400 4.80 % 133,150 120,059 13,091 10.90 % Unconsolidated joint venture income     1,758 468 1,290 275.64 % Total expenses 354,970 342,641 12,329 3.60 % 652,332 604,660 47,672 7.88 % Income before minority interests $ 411,171 $ 375,013 $ 36,158 9.64 % $ 227,021 $ 181,904 $ 45,117 24.80 % The increase in rental revenue in our Same Property Portfolio is primarily a result of an overall increase in rental rates on new leases and rollovers, an increase in reimbursable operating expenses, in addition to an increase in occupancy from year to year and an increase in termination fees from $2.3million to $3.3million. Rental revenue is comprised of base rent, including termination fees, recoveries from tenants and parking and other. Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Unbilled rents receivable represents the amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements. Straight line rent for the year ended December31, 2000 was $13.1million compared to $17.0million for the year ended December31, 1999. The occupancy for our Same Property Portfolio increased from 97.4% as of December31, 1999 to 98.8% as of December31, 2000. The additional increases in rental revenues in our total portfolio are primarily the result of rental revenues earned on properties we acquired or placed in service after January1, 1999.
The decrease in development and management services income in the total portfolio is mainly due to contracts expiring during 1999 and 2000.
The increase in interest and other income in the total portfolio is a result of interest earned on proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock in October2000 which resulted in higher average cash balances for the year ended December31, 2000.
Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in our Same Property Portfolio increased mainly due to increases in real estate taxes of $4.0million, or 4.2%. Most office leases include reimbursement for these operating expenses. Small increases in other property operating expenses account for the balance of the increase. Additional increases in property operating expenses in our total portfolio were mainly due to properties we acquired or placed-in-service after January1, 1999 as well as increases in other property-related expenses.
General and administrative expenses increased due to increases in the overall size of our total portfolio since January1, 1999. In addition, we incurred a $3.0million charge related to the departure of two senior employees, which included a non-cash charge of approximately $2.0million.
31 Interest expense for our total portfolio increased due to net increase in mortgage indebtedness and increased amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit with Fleet National Bank, as agent, from $3.3billion to $3.4billion.
Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December31, 2000 and 1999 were $5.0million and $3.2million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the years ended December31, 2000 and 1999 was $37.7million and $17.0million, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization expense for our Same Property Portfolio increased as a result of capital and tenant improvements made during 2000. Additional increases in depreciation and amortization expense for our total portfolio were due to properties we acquired or placed in service after January1, 2000 and related capital and tenant improvements.
Unconsolidated joint venture income increased as a result of income earned on joint venture properties being placed in service during 2000 and income earned on joint venture properties acquired after January1, 1999.
We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence, but do not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were $98.1million and $281.0million at December31, 2001 and December31, 2000, respectively. The decrease was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows: Year Ended December31, 2001 2000 $ Change (In Millions) Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 419.4 $ 329.5 $ 89.9 Cash Used for Investing Activities $ (1,303.6 ) $ (563.2 ) $ (740.4 ) Cash Provided by Financing Activities $ 701.3 $ 502.6 $ 198.7 The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the increase in net income resulting from properties acquired and developments that were placed in service after January1, 2000 and increases in net income from our Same Property Portfolio through 2000 and 2001.
Net cash used for investing activities increased from $563.2million for the year ended December31, 2000 to $1,303.6million for the year ended December31, 2001 mainly due to increased development activity and the acquisition of Citigroup Center during 2001. The net cash used in the 2001 investing activities was primarily for the following transactions: Acquisitions, Dispositions and Development Transactions:  On February13, 2001, the Company acquired a 4.3-acre parcel of land at 77Fourth Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts for cash of approximately $13.0million. This site will support an approximately 202,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office building.
32  On March30, 2001, the Company disposed of 25-33 Dartmouth Street in Westwood, Massachusetts, an industrial building totaling approximately 78,000 net rentable square feet. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $6.6million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $4.7million (net of minority interest share of approximately $1.1million).
On April25, 2001, the Company closed on the acquisition of the approximately 1.6million net rentable square foot office tower in New York City known as Citigroup Center. The acquisition was completed through a venture with a third party private real estate investment company. The total acquisition cost of approximately $755million, was funded through new mortgage financing totaling $525million, cash contributed to purchase equity in the acquiring entity of $195million from Boston Properties Limited Partnership and the balance from the third party private real estate investment company. Our $195million equity investment will earn a preferential return of 10% per annum. The preferred equity and any accumulated unpaid portion of the priority return on our equity investment will be payable before the third party affiliate receive a return on its common interest. Based on our current forecasts for the property, we expect to receive 100% of the cash flow after debt service for the 10years following the acquisition. Financial results of the venture are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company controls the entity that owns the property.
On June29, 2001, the Company disposed of Maryland Industrial Park, Buildings Two and Three, consisting of two industrial buildings totaling approximately 183,945 square feet, for net proceeds of approximately $7.6million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $1.9million (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.4million).
On November8, 2001, the Company disposed of a parcel of land known as the Belvedere Condominium/Retail Project located at the Prudential Center in Boston, Massachusetts for net proceeds of approximately $11million, resulting in a gain of approximately $2.3million (net of minority interest of approximately $0.5million.)  On November29, 2001, the Company acquired an approximately 22-acre parcel of land in Reston, Virginia for cash of approximately $8.6million. This site will support an approximately 358,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office building.
On December19, 2001, the Company acquired a 74-acre parcel of land in Weston, Massachusetts for cash of approximately $18million, which includes a deposit made in 2000 of approximately $9million. This site will support an approximately 350,000 net rentable square foot ClassA office building.
33  We placed seven ClassA office buildings in service, which required a total investment during 2001 of approximately $51.6million. We began or continued construction on an additional twelve office buildings and incurred approximately $631.1million of construction costs during 2001.

In total, our existing construction loans have $657.0million remaining to be drawn out of a total $1.5billion. Of the remaining commitment of $672.3million on our construction projects, $657.0 of the costs will be covered under our existing construction loans. In addition, we expect to close an additional construction loan relating to the Shaws Supermarket project of $24.0million in the first quarter of 2002.
Cash provided by financing activities increased by $198.7million for the year ended 2001 to $701.3million from $502.6million for the year ended 2000. During 2001, we received proceeds from new debt totaling approximately $1.1billion. This was offset by $229.0million of paydowns and principal payments and $276.5million of dividend and distribution payments during 2001.
Capitalization At December31, 2001, our total consolidated debt was approximately $4.3billion. The weighted-average rate of our consolidated indebtedness was 6.57% and the weighted average maturity was approximately 5.7years.
Our total market capitalization was approximately $9.1billion at December31, 2001. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December31, 2001 closing stock price of $38.0 per share and includes the following: (1)90,780,591 shares of our common stock, (2)20,212,776 of common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership (excluding common units held by Boston Properties,Inc.), (3)an aggregate of 11,010,839 common units issuable upon conversion of all Series One, Two, Three and Z preferred units, (4)2,624,672 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of all 2,000,000 shares of our SeriesA preferred stock, and (5)our consolidated debt.

We utilize our $605.0million unsecured revolving line of credit principally to fund development of properties, other land and property acquisitions and for working capital purposes. Our unsecured revolving line of credit is a recourse obligation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Outstanding balances under the unsecured revolving line of credit currently bear interest at a floating rate based on an increase over Eurodollar from 105 to 170 basis points or an increase over the lender's prime rate from zero to 75 basis points, depending upon our applicable leverage ratio. Our ability to borrow under our unsecured revolving line of credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: (1)loan-to-value ratio against our total borrowing base not to exceed 55%, unless our leverage ratio exceeds 60%, in which case it is not to exceed 50%, (2)a loan-to-value ratio against the total secured borrowing base not to exceed 55%, (3)debt service coverage ratio of 1.40 for our borrowing base, or 1.50 if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 60%, and 1.30 for us as a whole for full fixed charges, (4)a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however five consecutive quarters (not including the two quarters prior to expiration) can go to 65%, (5)limitations on additional indebtedness and stockholder distributions, and (6)a minimum net worth requirement.
At December31, 2001, we had issued letters of credit totaling $3.5million secured by our unsecured line of credit and had the ability to borrow an additional $601.5million under our unsecured revolving line of credit. As of February28, 2002, there were no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit.

Joint Ventures We have investments in eight unconsolidated joint ventures with ownership ranging from 25-51%. We do not have control of these partnerships, and therefore, they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. At December31, 2001, our share of the debt related to these investments is equal to approximately $216.2million. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt relative to our investment in these joint venture properties at December31, 2001: Properties Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date Metropolitan Square (51%) 8.23 % $ 70,476 May 1, 2010 Market Square North (50%) 7.70 % 49,373 December 19, 2011 Discovery Square (50%) 3.60 % 23,048 December 8, 2003 Two Freedom Square (50%) 3.74 % 21,058 June 29, 2004 One Freedom Square (25%) 7.75 % 19,130 June 30, 2012 265 Franklin Street (35%) 3.41 % 18,900 October 1, 2002 140 Kendrick Street (25%) 7.51 % 14,197 July 1, 2013 Total 6.67 % $ 216,182 Stock Repurchase On September14, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program under which we are permitted to purchase up to $100million of our outstanding common stock. From that date 37 through February28, 2002, we purchased 78,900 shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $2.7million. As a result, we have authorization to repurchase up to an additional $97.3million of our outstanding common stock, which we may repurchase from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on market prices and other conditions. The authority granted by the Board of Directors may, in the discretion of our senior management, be exercised form time to time and in such amounts as market conditions warrant.
General We have determined that our estimated cash flows and available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet liquidity needs for the next twelve months. We believe that our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to fund normal recurring expenses, debt service requirements, current development costs not covered under construction loans and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that these needs will be fully funded from cash flows provided by operating and financing activities.
We expect to meet liquidity requirements for periods beyond twelve months for the costs of development, property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements through construction loans, the incurrence of long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, income from operations and sales of real estate and possibly the issuance of additional common and preferred units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership and equity securities of Boston Properties,Inc. In addition, we may finance the development, redevelopment or acquisition of additional properties by using our unsecured revolving line of credit.
Rental revenues, operating expense reimbursement income from tenants, and income from the operations are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service and recurring capital expenditures. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue include third party fees generated by our office and industrial real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for operating expenses, debt service and recurring capital expenditures.
Based on leases in place at December31, 2001, leases with respect to 4.1% of our ClassA office buildings will expire in calendar year 2002. Although we are unable to estimate the actual rate of future leases, we believe that the expiring leases may be renewed, or space re-let, at higher or the same rents than previously in effect. While we are working to retain our current tenants in situations that are beneficial to us, conditions over the past year, including more sublet space available and decreasing rental rates across the board, make it difficult for us to predict what future changes may be and how they will effect our re-leasing efforts.
The aftermath of the September11, 2001 terrorist attacks has resulted in higher operating costs for many of our properties due to heightened security measures. At this time we are not able to predict whether these increased costs will abate over time, or whether we will continue to be able to pass them through to our tenants. These and other long-term effects on our business of the September11, 2001 events are unknown at this time, but could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted.
During the year ended December31, 2001, we paid or declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.27 per common share (consisting of $.53 related to the quarter ended March31, 2001 and $.58 related to each of the quarters ended June30, 2001, September30, 2001 and December31, 2001). We intend to continue paying dividends quarterly.
38 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our long-term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our long-term debt obligation is affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term fixed rate non-recourse debt of similar duration. In addition, we maintain a major unencumbered portion of our portfolio. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to strong tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 80% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk until the maturity of such outstanding debt.
We have entered into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objective when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure, which, in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates. At December31, 2001, we had hedge contracts totaling $150million. The hedging agreements provide for a fixed interest rate when LIBOR is less than 5.80% and when LIBOR is between 6.70% and 9.00% for terms ranging from three to five years per the individual hedging agreements. We will consider entering into additional hedging agreements with respect to all or a portion of our variable rate debt. We may borrow additional money with variable rates in the future. Increases in interest rates could increase interest expense, which in turn could affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt. As a result of the hedging agreements, decreases in interest rates could increase interest expense as compared to the underlying variable rate debt and could result in us making payments to unwind such agreements. During 2001, we paid the fair value of a swap arrangement and two hedge contracts that were in place during 2000 and part of 2001 in order to terminate the contracts.
At December31, 2001, our variable rate debt outstanding was approximately $866.0million. At December31, 2001, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 3.77%. Taking the hedging contracts into consideration, if market interest rates on our variable rate debt were to increase by ten percent (approximately 38 basis points), total interest would increase approximately $2.7million.
At December31, 2000, our variable rate debt outstanding was approximately $404.1million. At December31, 2000, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 8.56%. Taking the hedging contracts into consideration, if market interest rates on our variable rate debt were to increase by ten percent (approximately 86 basis points), total interest would increase approximately $1.7million.
These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.
Funds from Operations Pursuant to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts revised definition of Funds from Operations, we calculate Funds From Operations by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, including non-recurring items), for gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of properties (except gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties), real estate related depreciation and amortization and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We consider Funds from Operations, after supplemental adjustments, one measure of REIT performance. We believe that Funds From 39 Operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flow from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs. We compute Funds From Operations in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts which may not be comparable to Funds From Operations reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition or that interpret the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition differently. In addition to Funds from Operations (as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts), we also disclose Funds from Operations after certain supplemental adjustments. Funds From Operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.

These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties which we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time pre-existing environmental conditions at our properties have required environmental testing and/or regulatory filings.
In February1999, one of our affiliates acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We recently completed development of an office park on the property. Our affiliate engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Pursuant to the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed 41 to (1)bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2)continue remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3)indemnify our affiliate for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses.
Environmental investigations at two of our properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In both cases we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property Status Opinions. These Opinions concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may ultimately be responsible for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). No such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
One of our affiliates recently acquired a property in Massachusetts where historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The environmental consultant has concluded that (1)certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off-site source property and (2)certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic release on the subject property. The consultant has recommended filing a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to contamination migrating from off-site and conducting additional investigations, including the installation of off-site monitoring wells, to determine the nature and extent of contamination potentially associated with the historic use of the subject property. Our affiliate has authorized such additional investigations and will take necessary further response actions (if any are required).
Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures in connection with construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we recently acquired a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We anticipate that this contamination will be addressed in concert with future construction activities. When appropriate, we expect to filea plan detailing such activities with the state regulatory authority and to submit it for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory authority's public information process.
We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Newly Issued Accounting Standards On June29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.141, Business Combinations, and No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The provisions of SFAS 42 No.141 apply to all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001. SFAS No.142 becomes effective beginning January1, 2002. We do not anticipate that these standards will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.
In October2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of disposal of long-lived assets. This standard harmonizes the accounting for impaired assets and resolves some of the implementation issues as originally described in SFAS No.121. The new standard becomes effective for the year ending December31, 2002. We do not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.
Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases described above.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Approximately $3.4billion of our long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. The following table presents principal cash flows based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed rate debt. The interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December31, 2001 ranged from LIBOR or Eurodollar plus 1.60% to LIBOR or Eurodollar plus 2.00%.

51 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Properties,Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Boston Properties,Inc. (the "Company") at December31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial statement schedule are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial statement schedule, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company, on January1, 2001, adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts) 1.Organization and Basis of Presentation Organization Boston Properties,Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Boston Properties,Inc. is the sole general partner of Boston Properties Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") and at December31, 2001, owned an approximate 75.0% general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are denominated as "common units of partnership interest" (also referred to as "OP Units") or "preferred units of partnership interest" (also referred to as "Preferred Units"). All references to OP Units and Preferred Units exclude such units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership must redeem such OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company ("Common Stock"), except that the Company may, at its election, in lieu of a cash redemption, acquire such OP Unit for one share of Common Stock. Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, one share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of one OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. Each series of Preferred Units bears a distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Preferred Units may also be convertible into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof or the Company, subject to the terms of such Preferred Units.
All references to the Company hereafter refer to Boston Properties,Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.
Properties At December31, 2001, the Company owned a portfolio of 147 commercial real estate properties (145 properties at December31, 2000) (the "Properties") aggregating more than 40.7million net rentable square feet (including 12 properties under construction totaling approximately 4.9million net rentable square feet). The Properties consist of 139 office properties, including 107 ClassA office properties and 32 Office/Technical properties; five industrial properties; three hotels; and structured parking for 17,645 vehicles containing approximately 6.0million square feet. In addition, the Company owns or controls 44 parcels of land totaling 568.6 acres (which will support approximately 9.7million net rentable square feet of development). The Company considers ClassA office properties to be centrally located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, that attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. The Company considers Office/Technical properties to be properties that support office, research and development and other technical uses.
59 Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements of the Company include all the accounts of the Company, its majority-owned Operating Partnership, and subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Real Estate Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The Company periodically reviews its properties to determine if their carrying amounts will be recovered from future operating cash flows. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, those assets shall be reduced to fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.
The cost of buildings and improvements include the purchase price of property, legal fees and acquisition costs.
The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $59.3million, $37.7million and $17.0million, respectively. Salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $6.5million, $5.0million and $3.2million, respectively.
The acquisitions of minority interests for shares of the Company's Common Stock are recorded under the purchase method with assets acquired reflected at the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of acquisition. The acquisition amounts are allocated to real estate based on their estimated fair values.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Significant betterments are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period.
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Land improvements 25 to 40years Buildings and improvements 10 to 40years Tenant improvements Shorter of useful life or terms of related lease Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 to 7years 60 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. The majority of the Company's cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.
Escrows Escrows include amounts established pursuant to various agreements for security deposits, property taxes, insurance and other costs. At December31, 2000, proceeds of $57.6million from the permanent financing of a development property had been deposited into an escrow account and recorded in mortgage notes and bonds payable until the completion of construction on the development property, at which time the construction loan was repaid and the proceeds were made available to the Company.
Investments in Securities The Company accounts for investments in securities of publicly traded companies in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No.115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Investments" and has classified the securities as available-for-sale. Investments in securities of non-publicly traded companies are recorded at cost, as they are not considered marketable under SFAS115. During the year ended December31, 2001, the Company realized a loss totaling $6.5million related to the write-down of securities of two publicly traded telecommunications companies. The Company determined that the decline in the fair value of these securities was other than temporary as defined by SFAS No.115. As of December31, 2000, the fair value of the investments in common stocks and warrants was approximately $7.0million and the gross unrealized holding loss of approximately $11.7million was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred Charges Deferred charges include leasing costs and financing fees. Fees and costs incurred in the successful negotiation of leases, including brokerage, legal, leasing employee salaries and other costs have been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing have been deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans on a basis that approximates the effective interest method and are included with interest expense. Unamortized financing and leasing costs are charged to expense upon the early repayment of financing or upon the early termination of the lease. Fully amortized deferred charges are removed from the books upon the expiration of the lease or maturity of the debt.
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures, which it does not control, using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and the Company's share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included on the consolidated statements of operations.
61 The Company serves as the development manager for the joint ventures currently under development. The profit on development fees received from joint ventures is recognized to the extent attributable to the outside interests in the joint ventures.
Offering Costs Underwriting commissions and offering costs have been reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
Dividends Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, will differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes primarily in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation. Dividends declared represented 100% ordinary income for federal income tax purposes for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.
Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased revenue by $28.0million, $13.1million and $17.0million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Accrued rental income represents rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Property operating cost reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs are recognized in the period the expenses are incurred.
Development fees are recognized ratably over the period of development. Management fees are recognized as revenue as they are earned.
The estimated fair value of warrants received in conjunction with communications license agreements are recognized over the ten-year effective terms of the license agreements.
The Company recognizes gains from sales of real estate at the time of sale using the full accrual method, provided that various criteria related to the terms of the transactions and any subsequent involvement by us with the properties sold are met. If the criteria are not met, the Company defers the gains and recognizes them when the criteria are met or using the installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate under the circumstances.
Interest Expense and Interest Rate Protection Agreements Interest expense on fixed rate debt with predetermined periodic rate increases is computed using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective loans.
The Company has entered into certain interest rate protection agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt. The fair value of these agreements is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of these agreements are recorded in the 62 Consolidated Statements of Operations to the extent the agreements are not effective for accounting purposes.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from shares issuable through stock-based compensation including stock options, conversion of the minority interests in the Operating Partnership and conversion of the preferred stock of the Company.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments. Mortgage notes payable have aggregate carrying values that approximate their estimated fair values based upon the remaining maturities for certain debt and interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. The fair value of these financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying or contract values.
Income Taxes The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with its taxable year ended December31, 1997. As a result, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. The Company's policy is to distribute 100% of its taxable income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
To assist the Company in maintaining its status as a REIT, the Company leases its three in-service hotel properties, pursuant to leases with a participation in the gross receipts of such hotel properties, to a lessee ("ZL Hotel LLC") in which Messrs.Zuckerman and Linde, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, respectively, are the sole member-managers. Marriott International,Inc. manages these hotel properties under the Marriott name pursuant to management agreements with the lessee. Rental revenue from these leases totaled approximately $31.3million, $38.1million and $32.1million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities is approximately $1.2billion as of December31, 2001 and 2000.
Certain entities included in the Company's consolidated financial statements are subject to District of Columbia franchise taxes. Franchise taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
63 Reclassifications Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current-year presentation.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include such items as depreciation and allowances for doubtful accounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The mortgage notes payable are generally due in monthly installments and mature at various dates through August1, 2021.
Fixed rate mortgage notes and bonds payable totaled approximately $3.4billion and $3.0billion at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 6.40% to 9.65% (averaging 7.27% and 7.21% at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively).
Variable rate mortgage notes payable (including construction loans payable) totaled approximately $866.0million and $404.1million at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with interest rates ranging from 1.60% above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") (1.87% and 6.57% at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively) to 2.00% above LIBOR.
At December31, 2001, the Company was a party to hedge contracts totaling $150.0million. The hedging agreements provide for a fixed interest rate when LIBOR is less than 5.76% and when LIBOR is between 6.35% and 7.45% and between 7.51% and 9.00% for terms ranging from three to five years per the individual hedging agreements.
Mortgage notes payable aggregating approximately $115.1million and $190.5million at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, are subject to periodic scheduled interest rate increases. Interest expense for these mortgage notes payable is computed using the effective interest method. Mortgage notes payable aggregating approximately $220.7million and $224.8million at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, have been accounted for at their fair value on the date the mortgage loans were assumed. The impact of using these accounting methods decreased interest expense by $1.7million, $3.6million and $4.7million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The cumulative liability related to these accounting methods was $7.9million and $9.6million at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and is included in mortgage notes and bonds payable.
Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes and bonds payable at December31, 2001 are as follows: (In Thousands) 2002 $ 282,139 2003 809,695 2004 306,567 2005 277,880 2006 284,516 Thereafter 2,354,145 7.Unsecured Line of Credit As of December31, 2001, the Company had an agreement for a $605.0million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Unsecured Line of Credit") maturing in March2003. Outstanding balances under the Unsecured Line of Credit currently bear interest at a floating rate based on an increase over Eurodollar from 105 to 170 basis points or an increase over the lender's prime rate from 66 zero to 75 basis points, depending upon the Company's applicable leverage ratio. The Unsecured Line of Credit requires payments of interest only.
There were no outstanding balances on the Unsecured Line of Credit at December31, 2001 and 2000. The weighted-average balance outstanding was approximately $11.3million and $233.1million during the year ended December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding was approximately 5.49% and 7.65% during the year ended December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company's ability to borrow under the Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to the Company's ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, maintaining a certain ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value, as defined.
8.Commitments and Contingencies Concentrations of Credit Risk Management of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of tenants and may require tenants to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees and/or other financial guarantees. Although the Company's properties are geographically diverse and the tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of rental revenue from any single tenant, the inability of that tenant to make its lease payments could have an adverse effect on the Company.
Legal Matters The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
Environmental Matters It is the Company's policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys with respect to its properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, assets or results of operations, and the Company is not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to its properties which it believes would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time pre-existing environmental conditions at its properties have required environmental testing and/or regulatory filings.
In February1999, one of the Company's affiliates acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. The Company recently completed development of an office park on the property. The Company's affiliate engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and 67 groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Pursuant to the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1)bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to the Company's ownership, (2)continue remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3)indemnify the Company's affiliate for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses.
Environmental investigations at two of the Company's properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In both cases the Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property Status Opinions. These Opinions concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. The Company also believes that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although the Company believes that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may ultimately be responsible for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, the Company will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). No such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
One of the Company's affiliates recently acquired a property in Massachusetts where historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. The Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The environmental consultant has concluded that (1)certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off-site source property and (2)certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic release on the subject property. The consultant has recommended filing a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to contamination migrating from off-site and conducting additional investigations, including the installation of off-site monitoring wells, to determine the nature and extent of contamination potentially associated with the historic use of the subject property. The Company's affiliate has authorized such additional investigations and will take necessary further response actions (if any are required).
Some of the Company's properties and certain properties owned by its affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures in connection with construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is the Company's practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. The Company then uses this information as part of its decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, the Company recently acquired a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which it may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. The Company anticipates that this contamination will be addressed in concert 68 with future construction activities. When appropriate, the Company expects to filea plan detailing such activities with the state regulatory authority and to submit it for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory authority's public information process.
The Company expects that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Development The Company has twelve properties currently under construction. Commitments to complete these projects totaled approximately $672.3million and $677.7million at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Of the remaining commitment, $657.0 of the costs will be covered under its existing construction loans.
Sale of Property The Operating Partnership Agreement provides that, until June23, 2007, the Operating Partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer four designated properties in a taxable transaction without the prior written consent of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In connection with the acquisition or contribution of 32 other Properties, the Company entered into similar agreements for the benefit of the selling or contributing parties which specifically state the Company will not sell or otherwise transfer the Properties in a taxable transaction until specified dates ranging from June2002 to April2016. The Operating Partnership is not required to obtain the consent from a party protected thereby if such party does not continue to hold at least a specified percentage of such party's OP Units issued in connection with such acquisition or contribution.
9.Minority Interests Minority interests relate to the interest in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company and interests in property partnerships not owned by the Company. As of December31, 2001, the minority interest in the Operating Partnership consisted of 20,212,776 OP Units and 9,346,033 Preferred Units held by parties other than the Company.
On April25, 2001, the Company acquired Citigroup Center through a venture with a private real estate investment company. This venture is consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entity that owns the property. The equity interest in the venture that is not owned by the Company, totaling approximately $34.4million at December31, 2001, is included in Minority Interests on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The minority interest holder's share of income for Citigroup Center is reflective of the Company's preferential return on and of its capital.
The Preferred Units at December31, 2001 consist of 2,486,026 Series One Preferred Units of limited partnership in the Operating Partnership (the "Series One Preferred Units"), which bear a preferred distribution of 7.25% per annum on a liquidation preference of $34.00 per unit and are convertible into OP Units at a rate of $38.25 per Preferred Unit; 6,213,131 Series Two and Three Preferred Units of limited partnership in the Operating Partnership (the "Series Two and Three Preferred Units"), which bear a preferred distribution at an increasing rate, ranging from 5.00% to 69 7.00% per annum on a liquidation preference of $50.00 per unit and will be convertible into OP Units after December31, 2002 at a rate of $38.10 per Preferred Unit; and 650,876 SeriesZ Preferred Units, which bear distributions at a rate ranging from zero to the distribution rate of an OP Unit, with a liquidation preference of $37.25 per unit and are convertible into OP Units at a rate equal to the greater of (1)one-for-one or (2)$37.25 divided by the fair market value of an OP Unit on the earlier of (1)the date of each such conversion or (2)the date on which the Company registers the Common Stock that may be issued in exchange for any OP Units issued upon such conversion. Distributions to holders of Preferred Units are recognized on a straight-line basis that approximates the effective interest method.
10.Redeemable Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity As of December31, 2001, the Company had 90,780,591 shares of Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of SeriesA Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") outstanding. The Preferred Stock bears a preferred dividend at an increasing rate, ranging from 5.00% to 7.00% per annum on a liquidation preference of $50.00 per share and will be convertible into Common Stock after December31, 2002 at a rate of $38.10 per share. The preferred dividend is recognized on a straight-line basis that approximates the effective interest method. These shares of Preferred Stock are not classified as equity in certain instances as they are convertible into shares of Common Stock at the election of the holder after December31, 2002 or are redeemable for cash at the election of the holder in six annual tranches commencing on May12, 2009.
On September14, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company is permitted to purchase up to $100million of the Company's outstanding Common Stock. As of December31, 2001, the Company had repurchased 78,900 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $2.7million.
11.Future Minimum Rents The Properties are leased to tenants under net operating leases with initial term expiration dates ranging from 2002 to 2029. The future minimum lease payments to be received (excluding operating expense reimbursements) by the Company as of December31, 2001, under non-cancelable operating leases (including leases for properties under development), which expire on various dates through 2029, are as follows: Years Ending December 31, (In Thousands) 2002 $ 923,444 2003 943,470 2004 922,796 2005 845,119 2006 747,480 Thereafter 4,863,705 70 The geographic concentration of the future minimum lease payments to be received is detailed as follows: Location (In Thousands) Midtown Manhattan $ 4,739,448 Greater Washington, D.C.
1,657,972 Greater Boston 1,598,361 Greater San Francisco 900,526 New Jersey and Pennsylvania 349,707 No one tenant represented more than 10.0% of the Company's total rental revenue for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.
12.Segment Reporting The Company has determined that its reportable segments are those that are based on the Company's method of internal reporting, which classifies its operations by both geographic area and property type. The Company's reportable segments by geographic area are: Greater Boston, Greater Washington, D.C., Midtown Manhattan, Greater San Francisco, and New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Segments by property type include: ClassA Office, Office/Technical, Industrial and Hotel.
Asset information by reportable segment is not reported, since the Company does not use this measure to assess performance; therefore, the depreciation and amortization expenses are not allocated among segments. Development and management services revenue, interest and other revenue, general and administrative expenses and interest expense are not included in operating income, as the internal reporting addresses these on a corporate level.

The Company realized a loss of $0.2million (net of minority interest share of $0.1million) for the year ended December31, 2000 related to the sales of various properties. The Company realized a gain of $6.5million (net of minority interest share of $2.2million) for the year ended December31, 1999 from the sale of a property.
The Company incurred an extraordinary loss of $0.3million (net of minority interest share of $0.1million) for the year ended December31, 2000 from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the early extinguishment of a mortgage note payable.
14.Earnings Per Share Earnings per share is computed as follows: For the Year Ended December31, 2001 Income (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Basic Earnings Per Share: Income available to common stockholders $ 201,440 90,002 $ 2.24 Effect of Dilutive Securities: Stock Options and other 244 2,198 (.05 ) Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income available to common stockholders $ 201,684 92,200 $ 2.19 For the Year Ended December31, 2000 Income (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Basic Earnings Per Share: Income available to common stockholders $ 146,426 71,424 $ 2.05 Effect of Dilutive Securities: Stock Options and other  1,317 (.04 ) Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income available to common stockholders $ 146,426 72,741 $ 2.01 For the Year Ended December31, 1999 Income (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Basic Earnings Per Share: Income available to common stockholders $ 113,947 66,235 $ 1.72 Effect of Dilutive Securities: Stock Options  541 (.01 ) Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income available to common stockholders $ 113,947 66,776 $ 1.71 74 15.Employee Benefit Plan Effective January1, 1985, the predecessor of the Company adopted a 401(k) Savings Plan (the "Plan") for its employees. Under the Plan, as amended, employees as defined, are eligible to participate in the Plan after they have completed three months of service. In addition, participants may elect to make an after-tax contribution of up to 10% of their wages. Upon formation, the Company adopted the Plan and the terms of the Plan.
In November1999, the Company amended the Plan by increasing the Company's matching contribution to 200% of the first 3% from 200% of the first 2% of participant's pay contributed (utilizing pay that is not in excess of $100) and by eliminating the vesting requirement. The effective date of these changes was January1, 2000.
The Plan provides that matching employer contributions are to be determined at the discretion of the Company. The Company's matching contribution for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1.8million, $1.7million and $0.9million, respectively.
16.Stock Option and Incentive Plan and Stock Purchase Plan The Company has established a stock option and incentive plan for the purpose of attracting and retaining qualified executives and rewarding them for superior performance in achieving the Company's business goals and enhancing stockholder value.
Under the plan, the number of shares available for option grant is 14,699,162 shares plus as of the first day of each calendar quarter after January1, 2000, 9.5% of any net increase since the first day of the preceding calendar quarter in the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, on a fully converted basis (excluding Preferred Stock). At December31, 2001, the number of shares available for option grants under the plan was 4,673,521. The strike price on the shares granted is equal to the market price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date. Shares granted under the plan vest over two, three or five years. The term of each option is ten years from the date of grant.
The Company issued 44,842 and 34,822 shares of restricted stock during the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. There was no restricted stock issued prior to the year 2000. The shares of restricted stock were valued at approximately $1.8million ($40.75 per share) and $1.1million ($30.4375 per share) for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The restricted stock vests over a five-year period, with one-fifth of the shares vesting each year and has been recognized net of amortization as unearned compensation on the consolidated balance sheets. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock totaled $0.6million and $0.2million for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. There was no compensation expense related to restricted stock during the year ended December31, 1999.
75 A summary of the status of the Company's stock options as of December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and changes during the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 are presented below: Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 1, 1999 5,837,950 $ 30.58 Granted 1,777,408 $ 33.20 Exercised (24,023 ) $ 25.87 Canceled (35,877 ) $ 33.38 Outstanding at December 31, 1999 7,555,458 $ 31.20 Granted 1,072,750 $ 30.60 Exercised (511,281 ) $ 30.59 Canceled (15,245 ) $ 33.20 Outstanding at December 31, 2000 8,101,682 $ 31.15 Granted 3,247,250 $ 41.60 Exercised (406,371 ) $ 30.40 Canceled (35,003 ) $ 33.60 Outstanding at December 31, 2001 10,907,558 $ 34.28 The per share weighted-average fair value of options granted was $5.01, $3.79 and $3.98 for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The per share fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999.

76 The Company adopted the 1999 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock Purchase Plan") to encourage the ownership of Common Stock by eligible employees. The Stock Purchase Plan became effective on January1, 1999 with an aggregate maximum of 250,000 shares of Common Stock available for issuance. The Stock Purchase Plan provides for eligible employees to purchase at the end of the biannual purchase periods shares of Common Stock for 85% of the average closing price during the valuation period, as defined. The Company issued 8,538, 11,105 and 5,115 shares with the weighted average fair value of the purchase right equal to $36.02 per share, $28.15 per share and $30.24 per share under the Stock Purchase Plan as of December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The Company applies Accounting Practice Bulletin 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option and stock purchase plan. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized.
The compensation cost under SFAS123 for the stock performance-based plan would have been $11.7million, $12.0million and $10.5million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Had compensation cost for the Company's grants for stock-based compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS123, the Company's net income, and net income per common share for 2001, 2000 and 1999 would approximate the pro forma amounts below: 2001 2000 1999 Net income $ 189,786 $ 134,386 $ 103,481 Net income per common sharebasic $ 2.11 $ 1.88 $ 1.56 Net income per common sharediluted $ 2.06 $ 1.85 $ 1.55 The effects of applying SFAS123 in this pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts. SFAS123 does not apply to future anticipated awards.

SFAS No.133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. It requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria in SFAS No.133 are required to be reported through earnings. For derivatives designated as hedging instruments in qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivatives are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transactions occur and the ineffective portions are recognized in earnings.
On the date that the Company enters into a derivative contract, it designates the derivative as (1)a hedge of the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a recognized liability (a "cash flow" hedge), or (2)an instrument that is held for non-hedging purposes (a "non-hedging" instrument). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective asand that is designated and qualifies asa cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the hedged transaction (i.e. until periodic settlements of a variable-rate liability are recorded in earnings). Any hedge 79 ineffectiveness (which represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction) is recorded in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of non-hedging instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
The Company occasionally purchases a financial instrument in which a derivative instrument is "embedded." Upon purchasing the financial instrument, the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the financial instrument (i.e., the host contract) and whether a separate, non-embedded instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. When it is determined that (1)the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2)a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and designated as either (1)a fair-value or cash flow hedge or (2)a trading or non-hedging derivative instrument. However, if the entire contract were to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings, or if the Company could not reliably identify and measure the embedded derivative for purposes of separating that derivative from its host contract, the entire contract would be carried on the balance sheet at fair value and not be designated as a hedging instrument. Pursuant to SFAS No.137, the Company has selected January1, 1999 as the transition date for embedded derivatives.
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to (1)specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or (2)forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedging instrument's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not (or has ceased to be) highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1)it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item; (2)the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3)it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4)management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value in current-period earnings.
80 The Company entered into interest rate protection agreements during 2000, generally for the purpose of fixing interest rates on variable rate construction loans in order to reduce the budgeted interest costs on the Company's development projects, which would translate into higher returns on investment as the development projects come on-line. These interest rate protection agreements expire at varying dates through February2005. Other derivatives are not linked to specific assets or liabilities but are used by the Company to manage risk of the overall portfolio. Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective portion of cash flow hedges will be reclassified into earnings over the estimated life of the constructed asset. No material amounts are expected to be reclassified within the next twelve months.
Upon adoption of SFAS No.133, the Company recorded an asset of approximately $0.2million (included in prepaid expenses and other assets) and recorded a liability of approximately $11.4million for the fair values of these agreements. The offset for these entries was to a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and accumulated other comprehensive loss, respectively. Finally, the Company wrote-off deferred charges of approximately $1.6million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
The Company's derivatives also include investments in warrants to purchase shares of common stock of other companies. Based on the terms of the warrant agreements, the warrants meet the definition of a derivative and accordingly must be marked to fair value through earnings. The Company had been recording the warrants at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive loss as available-for-sale securities under SFAS No.115. Upon adoption of SFAS No.133, the Company reclassified approximately $6.9million, the fair value of the warrants, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
For the year ended December31, 2001, the Company recorded derivative gains (losses) of approximately ($29.0) million, $3.6million and ($1.1) million through earnings, which represented the total ineffectiveness of all cash flow hedges and other non-hedging instruments, the changes in value of the embedded derivatives and the change in value of the warrants, respectively. All components of each derivative's gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, except for the time value of option contracts. During 2001, the Company paid the fair value of the swap arrangement and two hedge contracts that were entered into during 2000 and part of 2001 in order to terminate the contracts. In addition, the Company recorded unrealized derivative losses through other comprehensive income of approximately $2.5million related to the effective portion of an interest rate swap agreement.
