B .Financial Information about Business Segments The financial information included in the tables that follow is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), unless otherwise indicated.Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years financial information to conform to the 2007 presentation.Industry rankings and percentages set forth below are for the year ended December 31, 2006, unless otherwise indicated.Unless otherwise noted, statements set forth in this document concerning CIGNAs rank or position in an industry or particular line of business have been developed internally, based on publicly available information.
Financial data for each of CIGNAs business segments is set forth in Note 19 to the Financial Statements on page96 of this Form 10-K.
1 C .Health Care CIGNAs Health Care operations (CIGNA HealthCare) offer insured and self-funded medical, dental, behavioral health, vision, and prescription drug benefit plans, health advocacy programs and other products and services that may be integrated to provide individuals with comprehensive health care benefit programs. CIGNA HealthCare also provides disability and life insurance products that were historically sold in connection with certain experience-rated medical products. These products and services are provided and administered by subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation.
CIGNA HealthCare is focused on helping to improve the health, well-being and security of the individuals whom CIGNA serves. CIGNA HealthCare believes the most sustainable approach to enhancing quality and managing health care costs is to fully engage consumers in their own health care. Therefore, CIGNA HealthCare seeks to engage its members by providing actionable information about health, including information about the cost and quality of care, that members can use to make informed choices about health care for themselves and their families.
Underlying CIGNA HealthCares operations is a foundation of clinical expertise and an ability to provide quality service at a competitive cost.CIGNA HealthCares strengths include:(1) its ability to integrate medical and specialty product offerings to achieve a more holistic and integrated approach to members health that promotes consistent case management; and (2) its ability to provide predictive modeling and other analytical tools (for example, through the Companys exclusive access to analytical tools and algorithms developed by the University of Michigan), to assist in providing targeted outreach and health advocacy by CIGNAs clinical professionals to CIGNA HealthCare members.
Principal Products and Services and Funding Arrangements With the exception of HMO and Medicare Part D products, each of CIGNA HealthCare's products (as described below) is offered with multiple funding options (also described below).CIGNA may sell multiple products under the same funding arrangement to the same customer.Accordingly, the revenue table included in Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) on page49 reflects both the product type and funding arrangement.
Medical CIGNA HealthCare provides a wide array of products and services to meet the needs of employers and other sponsors of health benefit plans and the employees and dependents participating in these plans, including:  Health       Maintenance Organizations "(HMOs") .
HMOs       are required by law to provide coverage for all basic health       services.They use various tools to facilitate the appropriate       use of health care services through employed and/or contracted health care       providers.HMOs control unit costs by negotiating rates of       reimbursement with providers and by requiring that certain treatments be       authorized for coverage in advance.CIGNA HealthCare offers HMO       plans that require members to obtain all non-emergency services from       participating providers as well as point of service (POS) HMO plans that       also provide a lesser level of insurance coverage for out-of-network care       from non-participating providers.
Network,       Point of Service ("POS")and Open Access Plus Plans .
CIGNA       HealthCare offers a product line of non-HMO managed care benefit       plans.All benefit plans in the managed care product line use       meaningful coinsurance differences for in-network versus out-of-network       care, give members the option of selecting a primary care physician, and       use a national provider network, which is somewhat smaller than the       national network used with the preferred provider ("PPO")       planproduct line.The Network product covers only those       services provided by CIGNA HealthCare participating providers and       emergency services provided by non-participating providers.POS       and Open Access Plus plans cover health care services provided by       participating, (in-network), and non-participating (out-of-network)       health care providers.
Preferred       Provider("PPO") Plans .
CIGNA       HealthCare also offers a PPO product line that features a broader national       network with generally less favorable provider discounts than the managed       care products described above, no option to select a primary care       physician, and in-network and out-of-network coverage, but with lesser       benefit incentives to encourage the use of participating       providers.
Voluntary       Plans .CIGNA HealthCare's voluntary medical products are       offered to employers with 51 or more eligible employees and are designed       to meet the needs of the working uninsured (such as hourly or part-time       employees) by offering more limited and 2 more       affordable coverage than traditional major medical plans.
CIGNA HealthCare       strengthened its presence in the voluntary benefits marketplace in 2006       with the acquisition of the Star HRG SM voluntary health insurance business and the introduction of the       Fundamental Care SM product that provides higher coverage levels than other limited benefit       plans.
CIGNA       Choice Fund  ,       Health Reimbursement Arrangement ("HRAs"), Health Savings Accounts       ("HSAs") and Flexible Spending Accounts ("FSAs") .
In       connection with many of the products described above, CIGNA offers the       CIGNA Choice Fund  suite of consumer-directed products, including HRA, HSA and FSA       options.An HRA allows employers to choose from a variety of       benefit plan designs (such as HMO or PPO) and for employees to fund       unreimbursed health care expenses with reimbursement account funds that       can be rolled over from year to year.HSA plans allow employers       to choose from a variety of benefit plan designs and funding options and       combine a high deductible payment feature fora health plan with a       tax-preferred savings account offering mutual fund investment       options.Funds in an HSA can be used to pay the deductible and       for other eligible tax-deductible medical expenses.In       connection with its consumer-directed products, CIGNA offers Custom       Benefit Builder SM ,       a tool that allows members to customize plan options including copayments       and deductible levels, to create a personalized benefit design that meets       their individual needs.In 2007, CIGNA expanded the       availability of its HRA plans to smaller businesses with 51-200 employees       and also began offering an integrated HSA product to this       segment.The HRA and HSA products for employers with 51-200       employees are now available in 49 states as well as in Puerto Rico and the       U.S. Virgin Islands.
Stop-Loss       Coverage .
CIGNA       HealthCare offers stop-loss insurance coverage to both experience-rated       and self-insured plans.This stop-loss coverage reimburses the       plan for claims in excess of some predetermined amount, for either       specific individuals, the entire group in aggregate, or     both.
Shared       Administration Services .
CIGNA       HealthCare makes available to self-insured Taft-Hartley trusts shared       administration products.CIGNA HealthCare provides these       self-insured plans access to its national provider network and provides       claim re-pricing and other services (e.g. utilization       management).
Specialty Health Advocacy and CareAllies SM .Through its CareAllies SM brand, CIGNA offers medical management, disease management, and health advocacy services to employers and other plan sponsors.CareAllies SM services are not only offered to members covered under CIGNA HealthCare administered plans but also to those employees who have elected coverage under a plan offered through their employer by competing insurers/third party administrators.CareAllies SM offers a consistent set of services to address the clinical and administrative inconsistencies that are inherent in the multi-vendor approach.Through its health advocacy programs, CIGNA HealthCare works to:  help       healthy people stay healthy;  help       people change behaviors that are putting their health at     risk;  help       people with existing health care issues access quality care and practice       healthy self-care; and  help       people with a disabling illness or injury return to productive work       quickly and safely.

Retail Pharmacies .

Funding Arrangements The segments health care products and services are offered through the following funding arrangements:  guaranteed       cost;  retrospectively       experience-rated (including minimum premium funding arrangements);       and  service.
Guaranteed Cost .
Under guaranteed cost funding arrangements, group policyholders pay a fixed premium and CIGNA bears the risk for claims and costs that exceed the premium.The HMO product is offered only on a guaranteed cost basis.
Retrospectively Experience-rated (Including Minimum Premium) .
Under retrospectively experience-rated funding arrangements, a premium that typically includes a margin to partially protect against adverse claim fluctuations is determined at the beginning of the policy period.CIGNA generally bears the risk if claims and expenses exceed premiums, but has the potential to recover these deficits from margins in future years if coverage is renewed.For additional discussion, see Pricing, Reserves and Reinsurance on page 7.
Under minimum premium funding arrangements, instead of simply paying a fixed monthly premium, the group policyholder establishes and funds a bank account and authorizes the insurer to draw upon funds in the account to pay claims.The policyholder pays a monthly residual premium while the policy is in effect and a supplemental premium (to cover reserves for run-out claims and expenses) upon termination.Minimum premium funding arrangements combine insurance protection with an element of self-funding.The policyholder is responsible for funding all claims up to a predetermined aggregate, maximum amount, and CIGNA bears the risk for claim costs incurred in excess of that amount.CIGNA has the potential to recover this deficit from margins in future years if the policy is renewed.Accordingly, minimum premium funding arrangements have a risk profile similar to retrospectively experience-rated insurance arrangements.
Service .
Under the service funding arrangement, CIGNA HealthCare contracts with employers on an administrative services only (ASO) basis to administer claims.CIGNA HealthCare collects administrative service fees in exchange for providing ASO plans with access toCIGNA HealthCare'sapplicable participating provider network and for providing other services and programs, including: quality management, utilization management; cost containment; health advocacy; 24-hour help line; case management; disease management; pharmacy benefit management; behavioral health care management services (through its provider networks); or a combination of the above.The employer/plan sponsor is responsible for self-funding all claims, but may purchase stop-loss insurance from CIGNA HealthCare or other insurers for claims in excess of some predetermined amount, for either individuals, the entire group in aggregate, or both.
Financial information regarding premiums and fees is presented on page 48 in the MD&A section of this Form 10-K.Other financial information about the Health Care segment is presented elsewhere in the MD&A section and 5 Note 19 to CIGNA's 2007 Financial Statements on page 96 of this Form 10-K.
Service and Quality CIGNA HealthCare operateseight service centers that together processed approximately 107 million medical claims in 2007.Satisfying customers and members is a primary business objective and critical to the Companys success.To address a variety of member issues, CIGNA HealthCare offers members access to its grievance and appeals processes.CIGNA operatessix member service centers that members can call toll-free to address requests for information and complaints and grievances.CIGNA HealthCare customer service represe ntatives are empowered to immediately resolve a wide range of issues to help membersobtain the most from their benefit plan.In many cases, a customer service representative can resolve the members issue.If an issue cannot be resolved informally, CIGNA HealthCare has a formal appeals process that can be initiated by telephone or in writing and involves two levels of internal review.For those matters not resolved by internal reviews, CIGNA HealthCare members are offered the option of a voluntary external review of claims.The CIGNA HealthCare formal appeals process addresses member inquiries and appeals concerning initial medical necessity based coverage determinations and other benefits/coverage determinations.CIGNA HealthCares formal appeals process meets National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) and/or applicable state regulatory requirements.
CIGNA HealthCare's commitment to promoting quality care and service to its customers is reflected in a variety of activities, including:the credentialing of medical providers and facilities that participate in CIGNA HealthCare's managed care and PPO networks; the development of the CIGNA Care Network  described below, and participation in initiatives that provide information to members to enable educated health care decision making.
Participating Provider Network .CIGNA has an extensive national network of participating health care providers, which as ofDecember 31, 2007 consisted ofapproximately 5,100 hospitals and approximately 542,000 providers as well as other facilities, pharmacies and vendors of health care services and supplies.As of December 31, 2006, CIGNA's national network of participating health care providers consisted of approximately 5,000 hospitals and approximately 519,000 providers.
In most instances, CIGNA contracts directly with the participating provider to provide covered services to members at agreed-upon rates of reimbursement.In some instances, however, CIGNA companies contract with third parties for access to their provider networks.In addition, CIGNA has entered into strategic alliances with several regional managed care organizations (Tufts Health Plan, HealthPartners, Inc., Health Alliance Plan, and MVP Health Plan) to gain access to their market leading provider networks and discounts.
CIGNA Care Network  .
CIGNA Care Network  is a benefit design option available for CIGNA HealthCare administered plans in 58 service areas across the country.CIGNA Care Network  is a subset of participating physicians in certain specialties who are designated as CIGNA Care Network  providers based on specific quality and cost-efficiency selection criteria.Members pay reduced co-payments or co-insurance when they receive care from a specialist designated as a CIGNA Care Network  provider.CIGNA participating specialists are evaluated annually for the CIGNA Care Network  designation.
Provider Credentialing .
CIGNA HealthCare credentials physicians, hospitals and other health care providers in its participating provider networks using quality criteria which meets or exceeds the standards of external accreditation or state regulatory agencies, or both.Typically, most providers are recredentialed every three years.
Health Plan Credentialing .
Each of CIGNAs 23 HMO and POS plans that have undergone an accreditation review have earned the highest rating possible  Excellent  from the NCQA and have earned Distinction for NCQA's Quality Plus Member Connections and Physician and Hospital Quality standards.The Member Connections standards assess a plan's web-based and telephonic consumer decision support tools.The Physician and Hospital Quality standards assess how well a plan provides members with information about physicians and hospitals in its network to help consumers make informed health care decisions.In early 2008, CIGNA received Full accreditation (the highest rating possible) from NCQA for its PPO plans and for CIGNAs Open Access Plus plans nationwide.The case management and utilization management programs provided to CIGNA members have been awarded full accreditation by URAC.
6 HEDIS  Measures .
In addition, CIGNA participates in NCQAs Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS  ) Quality Compass Report.HEDIS  Effectiveness of Care measures are a standard set of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of managed care organization clinical programs.CIGNAs national results compare favorably to industry averages.
Technology .
CIGNA HealthCare understands the critical importance of information technology to the level of service the Company is able to provide to its customers and to the continued growth of the health care business.The health care marketplace is evolving and the level of service that is acceptable to consumers today may not be acceptable tomorrow.Therefore, CIGNA HealthCare continues to invest in its information technology infrastructure and capabilities including technology essential to fundamental claim administration and customer service, as well as tools and Internet-enabled technology that support CIGNA HealthCare's focus on engaging members in health care decisions.
For example, CIGNA HealthCare has developed a range of consumer decision support tools including:  myCIGNA.com,       CIGNAs consumer Internet portal.The portal is personalized       with each members CIGNA medical, dental and pharmacy plan       information;  myCignaPlans.com,       a website which allows prospective members to compare plan coverage and       pricing options, before enrolling, based on a variety of       factors.The application gives consumers information on the       total health care cost to them and their   employer;  a       number of interactive online cost and quality information tools that       compare hospital quality and efficiency information, prescription drug       choices and average price estimates and member-specific average       out-of-pocket cost estimates for certain medical procedures;       and  Health       Risk Assessment, an online interactive tool through which consumers can       identify potential health risks and monitor their health       status.
In addition,a special website designed for seniors was launched in 2007 to offer customized features as well as access to both the myCIGNA.com and cigna.com websites.
Pricing, Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums and fees charged for HMO and most health insurance products and life insurance products are generally set in advance of the policy period and are guaranteed for one year.Premium rates are established either on a guaranteed cost basis or on a retrospectively experience-rated basis.
Charges to customers established on a guaranteed cost basis at the beginning of the policy period cannot be adjusted to reflect actual claim experience during the policy period.A guaranteed cost pricing methodology reflects assumptions about future claims, health care inflation (unit cost, location of delivery of care and utilization), the adequacy of fees charged for administration and risk assumption, effective medical cost management, expenses, credit risk, enrollment mix, investment returns, and profit margins.Claim and expense assumptions may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the account or on a pool of accounts, depending on the group size and the statistical credibility of the experience.Generally, guaranteed cost groups are smaller and less statistically credible than retrospectively experience-rated groups.In addition, pricing for health care products that use networks of contracted providers reflects assumptions about the impact of the reimbursement rates in the provider contracts on future claims.Premium rates may vary among accounts to reflect the anticipated contract mix, family size, industry, renewal date, and other cost-predictive factors.In some states, premium rates must be approved by the state insurance departments, and state laws may restrict or limit the use of rating methods.
Premiums established for retrospectively experience-rated business may be adjusted for the actual claim and, in some cases, administrative cost experience of the account through an experience settlement process subsequent to the policy period.To the extent that the cost experience is favorable in relation to the prospectively determined premium rates, a portion of the initial premiums may be credited to the policyholder as an experience refund.If claim experience is adverse in relation to the initial premiums, CIGNA may recover the resulting experience deficit, according to contractual provisions, through future premiums and experience settlements, provided the policy remains in force.
7 CIGNA HealthCare contracts on an ASO basis with customers who fund their own claims.CIGNA HealthCare charges these customers administrative fees based on the expected cost of administering their self-funded programs.In some cases, CIGNA provides performance guarantees related to its administrative function.If these standards are not met, CIGNA HealthCare may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount.
In addition to paying current benefits and expenses under insurance policies and HMO service agreements, CIGNA HealthCare establishes reserves for amounts estimated to settle reported claims not yet paid, as well as claims incurred, but not yet reported.Also, liabilities are established for estimated experience refunds based on the results of retrospectively experience-rated policies and applicable contract terms.
As of December 31, 2007, approximately $1.08 billion, or 69% of the reserves of CIGNA's Health Care operations comprise liabilities that are likely to be paid within one year, primarily for medical and dental claims, as well as certain group disability and life insurance claims.Of the reserve amount expected to be paid within one year, $258 million relates to amounts recoverable from certain ASO customers and from minimum premium policyholders, and is offset by a receivable.The remaining reserves related primarily to contracts that are short term in nature, but have long term payouts and include liabilities for group long-term disability insurance benefits and group life insurance benefits for disabled and retired individuals, benefits paid in the form of both life and non-life contingent annuities to survivors and contract holder deposit funds.
CIGNA HealthCare credits interest on experience refund balances to retrospectively experience-rated policyholders through rates that are set at CIGNA HealthCares discretion taking investment performance and market rates into consideration.Generally, for interest-crediting rates set at CIGNA HealthCares discretion, higher rates are credited to funds with longer terms reflecting the fact that higher yields are generally available on investments with longer maturities.For 2007, the rates of interest credited ranged from 3.25% to 4.30%, with a weighted average rate of 3.70%.
The profitability of CIGNA HealthCare's fully insured health care products depends on the adequacy of premiums charged relative to claims and expenses.For medical and dental products, profitability reflects the accuracy of cost projections for health care (unit costs and utilization), the adequacy of fees charged for administration and risk assumption and effective medical cost and utilization management.
CIGNA HealthCare reduces its exposure to large catastrophic losses under group life, disability and accidental death contracts by purchasing reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers.
Markets and Distribution CIGNA HealthCare targets the following markets for its products:  national       accounts, which are multi-site employers with more than 5,000       employees;  regional       accounts, which are generally defined as multi-site employers with more       than 200 but fewer than 5,000 employees, and single-site employees with       more than 200 employees;  small       business and individual, which includes employers with 2 - 200 employees       and individuals;  government,       which includes employees in federal, state and local governments, primary       and secondary schools, and colleges and   universities;  Taft-Hartley       plans, which includes members covered by union trust   funds;  seniors,       which focuses on the health care needs of individuals 50 years and older;       and  voluntary,       which focuses on employers with working uninsured     employees.
To date, the national and regional account markets have comprised a significant amount of CIGNA HealthCare's business.
CIGNA HealthCare employs group sales representatives to distribute its products and services through insurance brokers and insurance consultants or directly to employers.CIGNA HealthCare also employs representatives to sell utilization review services, managed behavioral health care and employee assistance services directly to insurance companies, HMOs, third party administrators and employer groups.As of December 31, 2007, the field sales force for the products and services of this segment consisted of approximately 840 sales representatives in approximately 100 field locations.
8 Competition CIGNA HealthCare's businessis subject to intense competition, and industry consolidation has created an even more competitive business environment.While no one competitor or small number of competitors dominates the health care market, CIGNA expects a continuing trend of consolidation in the industry with the emergence of consumer engagement intensifying this trend.
In certain geographic locations some health care companies may have significant market share positions.A large number of health care companies and other entities compete in offering similar products.Competition in the health care market exists both for employers and other groups sponsoring plans and for the employees in those instances where the employer offers its employees the choice of products of more than one health care company.Most group policies are subject to annual review by the policyholder, who may seek competitive quotations prior to renewal.
The principal competitive factors are: quality of service; scope; cost-effectiveness and quality of provider networks; effectiveness of medical care management; product responsiveness to the needs of customers and their employees; cost-containment services; technology; price; and effectiveness of marketing and sales.In addition, financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also a competitive factor.For more information concerning insurance ratings, see Ratings in Section J beginning on page 25.CIGNA HealthCare believes that its national scope, integrated approach to consumer engagement, breadth of product and funding offerings, clinical care and medical management capabilities and funding options are strategic competitive advantages.These advantages allow CIGNA to respond to the diverse needs of its customer base in each market in which it operates.CIGNA also believes that its focus on helping to improve the health, well-being and security of its members will allow it to distinguish itself from its competitors.
The principal competitors are:  other       large insurance companies that provide group health and life insurance       products;  Blue       Cross and Blue Shield organizations;  stand-alone       HMOs and PPOs;  third       party administrators;  HMOs       affiliated with major insurance companies and hospitals;     and  national       managed pharmacy, behavioral health and utilization review services       companies.
Competition also arises from smaller regional or specialty companies with strength in a particular geographic area or product line, administrative service firms and, indirectly, self-insurers.In addition to these traditional competitors, a new group of competitors is emerging.These new competitors are focused on delivering employee benefits and services through Internet-enabled technology that allows consumers to take a more active role in the management of their health.This is accomplished primarily through financial incentives and access to enhanced medical quality data.The effective use of the Companys health advocacy capabilities, decision support tools (some of which are web-based) and enabling technology are critical to success in the health care industry, and CIGNA believes they will be competitive differentiators.CIGNA believes that it has the capabilities and appropriate strategy to allow it to compete against both traditional and new competitors.
Industry Developments and Strategic Overview Both state and federal lawmakers have supported a broad range of health care reform efforts due to the recent demand for changes to the health care industry.The proposal and/or passing of any reform initiatives would affect the health care industry in general and CIGNA, specifically. CIGNA advocates creating a value-based healthcare system that makes access to care universal, fosters and rewards quality, and makes care more affordable by educating consumers to the true costs and quality of careand supporting better decision making. CIGNA envisions such a system as a partnership between private and public sectors, taking the best of what the private and public sector programs offer and creating a system that addresses the needs of all. CIGNA is intensely involved indeveloping workable solutions for reforming America's healthcare system.
As part of its business strategy, CIGNA continually evaluates potential acquisitions and other transactions that could enhance the Companys competitive capabilities and provide a basis for membership growth and/or improved medical costs.In 2007 CIGNA entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of Great-West Healthcare, the healthcare division of Great-West Life & Annuity and acquired Sagamore Health Network, Inc., an Indiana-based health care provider network vendor.
9 Also, in connection with CIGNA's long-term business strategy, the Companyintends to continue to focus on the fundamentals of its health care business in order to provide consistent, reliable service to customers at a competitive cost; differentiating the health care business from its competitors by facilitating consumer engagement to realize improvement in the individuals health and well-being; and segment expansion, particularly in the voluntary, individual, small employer (fewer than 200 employees) and seniors markets, in which CIGNA HealthCare expects high-growth opportunities that complement its core business.
10 D .Disability and Life Principal Products and Services CIGNA's Disability and Life operations provide the following insurance products and their related services:group life insurance, long-term and short-term disability insurance, workers compensation and disability case management, and accident and specialty insurance.These products and services are provided by subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation.
Disability Insurance CIGNA markets group long-term and short-term disability insurance products and services in all states and statutorily required disability insurance plans in certain states.These products and services generally provide a fixed level of income to replace a portion of wages lost because of disability. They also provide assistance to the employee in returning to work and assistance to the employer in managing the cost of employee disability.Group disability coverage is typically employer-paid or a combination of employer and employee-paid.
CIGNA also provides case management and related services to workers compensation insurers and employers who self-fund workers compensation and disability benefits.
CIGNAs disability insurance products may be integrated with behavioral programs, workers compensation, medical programs, social security advocacy, and the Family and Medical Leave Act and leave of absence administration.CIGNA believes this integration provides customers with increased efficiency and effectiveness in disability claims management, enhances productivity and reduces overall costs to employers.Combining CIGNA disability and medical programs provides enhanced opportunities to influence outcomes, reduces the cost of both medical and disability events and improves the return to work rate.CIGNA has formalized an integrated approach to health and wellness through theDisability and Healthcare Connect Program.This program uses information from the CIGNA HealthCare and Disability databases to help identify, treat and manage disabilities before they become chronic, longer in duration and more costly.Proactive outreach from CIGNA Behavioral Health assists employees suffering from a mental health condition, either as a primary condition or as a result of another condition.CIGNA may receive fees for providing these integrated services to clients.
CIGNA is a leader in returning employees to work quickly.Shorter disability claim durations mean higher productivity and lower cost for employers and a better quality of life for their employees.Employees also report a high degree of satisfaction with the support CIGNA provides them to manage their disabilities and return them back to work.Data from a 2006 customer satisfaction survey showed that 9 out of 10 of CIGNA's short-term and long-term disability claimants were satisfied or very satisfied with how their claims were handled.
Approximately 5,600 disability policies covering approximately 4.3 million lives were outstanding as of December 31, 2007.
Life Insurance Group life insurance products include group term life and group universal life.Group term life insurance may be employer-paid basic life insurance or employee-paid supplemental life insurance.
CIGNA no longer actively markets group universal life insurance, but continues to administer the product for existing contractholders.Group universal life insurance is a voluntary life insurance product in which the owner may accumulate cash value.The cash value earns interest at rates declared from time to time, subject to a minimum guaranteed rate, and may be borrowed, withdrawn, or used to fund future life insurance coverage.With group variable universal life insurance, the cash value varies directly with the performance of the underlying investments and neither the return nor the principal is guaranteed.
Approximately 6,100 group life insurance policies covering approximately 6.0 million lives were outstanding as of December 31, 2007.
Other CIGNA offers personal accident insurance coverage, which consists primarily of accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident insurance to employers.Group accident insurance may be employer-paid or employee-paid.
CIGNA also offers specialty insurance services that consist primarily of life, accident and disability insurance to professional associations, financial institutions, schools and participant organizations.
Voluntary benefits are those principally paid by the employee and are offered at the employers worksite.
11 CIGNA plans provide, among other services, flexible enrollment options, list billing, medical underwriting, and individual record keeping. CIGNA designed its voluntary offerings to offer employers a complete and simple way to manage their benefits, including personalized enrollment communication and administration of the benefits program.
Markets and Distribution CIGNA markets the group insurance products and services described above to employers, employees, professional and other associations and groups.In marketing these products, CIGNA targets customers with 50 or more employees and employs group sales representatives to distribute the products and services of this segment through insurance brokers and consultants.As of December 31, 2007, the field sales force for the products and services of this segment consisted of approximately 200 sales professionals in 27 field locations.
Pricing, Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums and fees charged for disability and life insurance products are generally established in advance of the policy period and are generally guaranteed for one to three years, but contracts may be subject to early termination.
Premium rates reflect assumptions about future claims, expenses, credit risk, investment returns and profit margins. Claim and expense assumptions may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the account or on a pool of accounts, depending on the group size and the statistical credibility of the experience.
Fees for universal life insurance products consist of mortality, administrative and surrender charges assessed against the policyholders fund balance.Interest credited and mortality charges for universal life, and mortality charges on variable universal life, may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected interest and mortality experience.
In addition to paying current benefits and expenses, CIGNA establishes reserves in amounts estimated to be sufficient to pay reported claims not yet paid, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.For liabilities with longer-term pay-out periods such as long-term disability, reserves represent the present value of future expected payments.CIGNA discounts these expected payments using assumptions for interest rates and the length of time over which claims are expected to be paid. The annual effective interest rate assumption used in determining reserves for most of the long-term disability insurance business is 4.75% for claims that were incurred in 2007 and 2006.For universal life insurance, CIGNA establishes reserves for deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder, less mortality and administrative charges assessed against the contractholders fund balance.
The profitability of this segments products depends on the adequacy of premiums charged relative to claims and expenses.Effectiveness of return to work programs as well as adequate return on invested assets impact the profitability of disability insurance products.For life insurance products, the degree to which future experience deviates from mortality, morbidity and expense assumptions also affect profitability.
In order to reduce its exposure to large individual and catastrophe losses under group life, disability and accidental death contracts CIGNA purchases reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers.
Competition The principal competitive factors that affect the products of the Disability and Life segment are underwriting and pricing, the quality and effectiveness of claims management, relative operating efficiency, distribution methodologies and producer relations, the variety of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service.The Company believes that CIGNA's claims management capabilities provide a competitive advantage in this marketplace.
For certain products with longer-term liabilities, such as group long-term disability insurance, the financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also a competitive factor.For more information concerning insurance ratings, see Ratings in Section J beginning on page 25.
The principal competitors of CIGNAs group disability, life and accident businesses are other large and regional insurance companies that market and distribute these types of products.
As of December 31, 2007, CIGNA is one of the top providers of group disability, life and accident insurance, based on premiums.
12 Industry Developments and Strategic Initiatives The group insurance market remains highly competitive as the rising cost of providing medical coverage to employees has forced companies to reevaluate their overall employee benefit spending.Demographic shifts have further driven demand for products and services that are sufficiently flexible to meet the evolving needs of employers and employees who want innovative, cost-effective solutions to their insurance needs.
Employers are also expressing a growing interest in employee wellness, absence management and productivity and recognizing a strong link between health, productivity and their profitability.As a result, employers are looking to offer programs that promote a healthy lifestyle, offer assistance in returning to work and integrate healthcare and disability programs. CIGNA believes it is well positioned to deliver integrated solutions that address these broad employer and employee needs.
CIGNA also believes that its strong disability management portfolio and fully integrated programs provide employers and employees tools to prevent disability and mitigate its impact on health, productivity and the employers profitability.
13 E .International CIGNAs international operations offer life, accident and supplemental health insurance products and international health care products and services.These products and services are provided by subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation, including foreign operating entities.
Principal Products and Markets Life, Accident and Supplemental Health Insurance CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health insurance products generally provide simple, affordable coverage of risks for the health and financial security of individuals.These products are marketed primarily through distribution partners with whom the individual has an affinity relationship.Supplemental health products provide a specified payment for a variety of health risks and include personal accident, accidental death, critical illness, hospitalization, cancer and other dread disease coverages.Variable universal life insurance products are also included in the product portfolio.CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health insurance operations are located in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, New Zealand, Peoples Republic of China, Thailand, and the European Union.In the third quarter of 2007, CIGNA sold its Chilean insurance operations.In the third quarter of 2006, CIGNA entered into negotiations to sell its Brazilian life insurance business which is in run-off. The sale, which is subject toregulatory approval, is expected to close in 2008.
International Health Care Benefits CIGNA Internationals health care operations primarily consist of products and services to meet the needs of multinational companies and their expatriate employees and dependents.These benefits include medical, dental, vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability products.The customers of CIGNA Internationals expatriate benefits business are multinational companies and international organizations headquartered in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East and other international locations.The expatriate benefits products and services are offered through guaranteed cost, experience-rated, administrative services only, and minimum premium funding arrangements. For definitions of funding arrangements, see Funding Arrangements in Section C on page 5.
In addition, CIGNA Internationals health care operations include medical products, which are provided through group benefits programs in the United Kingdom and Spain. These products are primarily medical indemnity insurance coverage, with some offerings having managed care or administrative service aspects.These products generally provide an alternative or supplement to government programs.In the fourth quarter of 2007, CIGNA sold its Guatemalan health insurance operations.
Distribution CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health insurance products are distributed primarily through direct marketing channels, such as outbound telemarketing, in-branch bancassurance and direct response television.Marketing campaigns are conducted through these channels under a variety of arrangements with affinity partners.These affinity partners primarily include banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions.
CIGNA Internationals health care products are distributed through independent brokers and consultants, select partners as well as CIGNA Internationals own sales personnel.
Pricing, Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums for CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health insurance products are based on assumptions about mortality, morbidity, customer retention, expenses and target profit margins, as well as interest rates.The profitability of these products is affected by the degree to which future experience deviates from these assumptions.
Fees for variable universal life insurance products consist of mortality, administrative, asset management and surrender charges assessed against the contractholders fund balance.Mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected mortality experience.
Premiums and fees for CIGNA Internationals health care products reflect assumptions about future claims, expenses, investment returns, and profit margins.For products using networks of contracted providers, premiums reflect assumptions about the impact of provider contracts and utilization management on future claims.Most of the premium volume for the medical indemnity business is on a guaranteed cost basis.Other 14 premiums are established on an experience-rated basis.Most contracts permit rate changes at least annually.
The profitability of health care products is dependent upon the accuracy of projections for health care inflation (unit cost, location of delivery of care and utilization), the adequacy of fees charged for administration and risk assumption and, in the case of managed care products, effective medical cost management.
In addition to paying current benefits and expenses, CIGNA International establishes reserves in amounts estimated to be sufficient to settle reported claims not yet paid, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported. Additionally, for some individual life insurance and supplemental health insurance products, CIGNA International establishes policy reserves which reflect the present value of expected future obligations less the present value of expected future premiums net of costs and profits.CIGNA International defers acquisition costs incurred in the sales of long-duration life, accident and supplemental health products.For most products, these costs are amortized in proportion to premium revenue recognized, the timing of which is impacted by customer retention.For variable universal life products, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to expected gross profits.
CIGNA International reduces its exposure to large and/or multiple losses arising out of a single occurrence by purchasing reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers.
Competition Competitive factors in CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health operations include product innovation and differentiation, efficient management of direct marketing processes, commission levels paid to distribution partners, and quality of claims and policyholder services.
The principal competitive factors that affect CIGNA Internationals health care operations are underwriting and pricing, relative operating efficiency, relative effectiveness in medical cost management, product innovation and differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of claims and customer service.In most overseas markets, perception of financial strength is also an important competitive factor.
For the life, accident and supplemental health insurance line of business, locally based competitors are primarily locally based insurance companies, including insurance subsidiaries of banks.However, insurance company competitors in this segment primarily focus on traditional product distribution through captive agents, with direct marketing being a secondary objective.CIGNA International estimates that it has less than 2% market share of the total life insurance premiums in any given market in which it operates.
For the expatriate benefits business, CIGNA International is a market leader in the U.S., whose primary competitors include U.S.-based and European health insurance companies with global expatriate benefits operations.For the health care operations in the UK and Spain, the primary competitors are regional and local insurers, with CIGNA's market share at less than 5% of the premiums of the total local healthcare market.
CIGNA International expects that the competitive environment will intensify as U.S. and Europe-based insurance and financial services providers pursue global expansion opportunities.
CIGNA International conducts some of its international health care benefits operations and all of its life, accident and supplemental health insurance operations through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies.This reduces the exposure to economic loss resulting from unfavorable exchange rate movements.For information on the effect of foreign exchange exposure, see Market Risk on page62 and Note 2(R) to CIGNAs 2007 Financial Statements on page78 of this Form 10-K.
South Korea represents the single largest geographic market for CIGNA Internationals businesses.In 2007, South Korea generated 31% of CIGNA Internationals revenues and 41% of its segment earnings.For information on the concentration of risk with respect to CIGNA Internationals business in South Korea, see Other Items Affecting International Results on page53 of this Form 10-K.
Industry Developments Pressure on social health care systems and increased wealth and education in emerging markets is leading to higher demand for products providing health insurance and financial security.In the life, accident and supplemental health business, direct marketing is growing and attracting new competitors while industry consolidation among financial institutions and other affinity partners continues.For the international health care benefits business, trade liberalization and rapid economic growth in emerging markets is leading to multi-national companies expanding foreign operations.
15 F . Other Operations Other Operations consists of:  non-leveraged and leveraged corporate-owned life insurance;  deferred gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance and annuity business and the 2004 sale of the retirement benefits business; and  run-off settlement annuity business.
The products and services related to these operations are or were offered by subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation.
Corporate-owned Life Insurance (COLI) Principal Products and Markets The principal products of the COLI business are permanent insurance contracts sold to corporations to provide coverage on the lives of certain of their employees.Permanent life insurance provides coverage that, when adequately funded, does not expire after a term of years.The contracts are primarily non-participating universal life policies.The key distinction between leveraged and non-leveraged COLI products is that, with leveraged COLI, the product design anticipates borrowing by the policy owner of a portion of the surrender value, while policy loans are not a significant feature of non-leveraged COLI.
Universal life policies typically provide flexible coverage and flexible premium payments.Policy cash values fluctuate with the amount of the premiums paid, mortality and expense charges assessed, and interest credited to the policy. Variable universal life policies are universal life contracts in which the cash values vary directly with the performance of a specific pool of investments underlying the policy.
The principal services provided by the corporate-owned life insurance segment are issuance and administration of the insurance policies (e.g., maintenance of records regarding cash values and death benefits, claims processing, etc.) as well as oversight of the investment management for separate account assets that support the variable universal life product.The principal markets for COLI products are mid to large sized corporations, including banks.
Product Features Cash values on universal life policies are credited interest at a declared interest rate that reflects the anticipated investment results of the assets backing these policies and may vary with the characteristics of each product.Universal life policies generally have a minimum guaranteed declared interest rate which may be cumulative from the issuance dateof the policy.The declared interest rate may be changed monthly, but is generally changed less frequently.Variable universal life products do not have a guaranteed minimum crediting rate.
In lieu of credited interest rates, holders of certain universal life policies may elect to receive credited income based on changes in an equity index, such as the S&P 500  .No such elections have been made since 2004.
Mortality risk is retained according to guidelines established by CIGNA.To the extent a given policy carries mortality risk that exceeds these guidelines; reinsurance is purchased from third parties for the balance.
Distribution CIGNA's COLI products are offered through a select group of independent brokers with particular expertise in the bank market and in the use of COLI for the financing of benefit plan liabilities.
Industry Developments and Strategic Initiatives The legislative environment surrounding COLI has evolved considerably over the past decade.Most recently, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 included provisions related to the notice requirements given to insured employees and limited coverage to certain more highly compensated employees.These changes were widely viewed as clarification of existing rules or industry best practices.
Sale of Individual Life Insurance & Annuity and Retirement Benefits Businesses CIGNA sold its individual life insurance and annuity business in 1998 and its retirement business in 2004.Portions of the gains from these sales were deferred because the principal agreements to sell these businesses were structured as reinsurance arrangements.The deferred portion relating to the remaining reinsurance is being recognized at the rate that earnings from the sold 16 businesses would have been expected to emerge, primarily over 15 years on a declining basis.
Because the individual life and annuity business was sold in an indemnity reinsurance transaction, CIGNA is not relieved of primary liability for the reinsured business. Effective as of December 14, 2007, the purchaser placed the assets supporting the reserves for the purchased business into a trust for the benefit of CIGNA which qualifies to support CIGNA's credit for the reinsurance ceded under Regulation 114 of the New York Department of Insurance.As of December 31, 2007, the assets in the trust had a value of approximately $4.5 billion.
CIGNA's sale of its retirement business primarily took the form of an arrangement under which CIGNA reinsured with the purchaser of the retirement business the general account contractholder liabilities under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement and the separate account liabilities under modified coinsurance and indemnity reinsurance arrangements.
Since the sale of the retirement benefits business in 2004, the purchaser of that business has entered into agreements with certain insured party contractholders (novation agreements), which relieved CIGNA of any remaining contractual obligations to the contractholders. As a result, CIGNA reduced reinsurance recoverables, contractholder deposit funds, and separate account balances for these obligations.
The purchaser of the retirement benefits business deposited assets associated with the reinsurance of general account contracts into a trust (the "Ceded Business Trust") to provide security to CIGNA for the related reinsurance recoverables. The purchaser is permitted to withdraw assets from the Ceded Business Trust equal to the reduction in CIGNA's reserves whenever a reduction occurs. For example, reductions will occur when the purchaser enters into additional novation agreements and directly assumes liability to the insured party. As of December 31, 2007, assets totaling $4.0 billion remained in the Ceded Business Trust.
Settlement Annuity Business CIGNA's settlement annuity business is a run-off block of contracts.These contracts are primarily liability settlements with approximately half of the payments guaranteed and not contingent on survivorship. In the case of the contracts that involve non-guaranteed payments, such payments are contingent on the survival of one or more parties involved in the settlement.
17 G .Investments and Investment Income CIGNAs investment operations provide investment management and related services primarily for CIGNAs corporate invested assets and the insurance-related invested assets in its General Account ("Invested Assets"). CIGNA acquires or originates, directly or through intermediaries, various investments including private placements, public securities, commercial mortgage loans, real estate and short-term investments.CIGNAs Invested Assets are managed primarily by CIGNA subsidiaries and external managers with whom CIGNA's subsidiaries contract.
The Invested Assets comprise a majority of the combined assets of the Health Care, Disability and Life, Other Operations, and Run-off Reinsurance segments (collectively, the Domestic Portfolios).There are, in addition, portfolios containing Invested Assets that consist of the assets of the International segment (collectively, the International Portfolios).
Net investment income and realized investment gains (losses) are not reported separately in the investment operations.However, net investment income isincluded as a component of earnings for each of CIGNA's operating segments (Health Care, Disability and Life, Other Operations, Run-off Reinsurance and International), net of the expenses attributable to the investment operations.
Assets Under Management CIGNAs Invested Assets under management at December 31, 2007 totaled $17.5 billion.See Schedule I to CIGNA's 2007 Financial Statements on page FS-3 of this Form 10-K for more information as to the allocation to types of investments.
As of December 31, 2007, CIGNA's separate account funds consisted of:  $1.5       billion in separate account assets that are managed by the buyer of the       retirement benefits business pursuant to reinsurance arrangements       described in "Sale of Individual Life Insurance & Annuity and       Retirement Benefits Businesses" on page 16 of this Form     10-K;  $1.7       billion in separate account assets which constitute a portion of the       assets of the CIGNA Pension Plan; and  $3.8       billion in funds which primarily support certain corporate-owned life       insurance, health care and disability and life   products.
Types of Investments CIGNA invests in a broad range of asset classes, including domestic and international fixed maturities and common stocks, commercial mortgage loans, real estate and short-term investments. Fixed maturity investments include publicly traded and private placement corporate bonds, government bonds, publicly traded and private placement asset-backed securities, and redeemable preferred stocks.In connection with CIGNA's investment strategy to enhance investment yields by selling senior participations of commercial mortgage loans, as of December 31, 2007, commercial mortgage loans includes $77 million of commercial mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell.These commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market with any resulting valuation allowance reported in realized investment gains and losses.
For the International Portfolios, CIGNA invests primarily in publicly traded fixed maturities, short-term investments and time deposits denominated in the currency of the relevant liabilities and surplus.
Fixed Maturities CIGNA invests primarily in investment grade fixed maturities rated by rating agencies (for public investments) and by CIGNA (for private investments).For information about below investment grade holdings, see Investment Assets on page 60 of this Form 10-K.
Commercial Mortgages and Real Estate Commercial mortgage loan investments are subject to underwriting criteria addressing loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage, cash flow, tenant quality, leasing, market, location and borrowers financial strength.Such investments consist primarily of first mortgage loans on commercial properties and are diversified by property type, location and borrower.CIGNA invests primarily in commercial mortgages on fully completed and substantially leased commercial properties.Virtually all of CIGNAs commercial mortgage loans are balloon payment loans, under which all or a substantial portion of the loan principal is due at the end of the loan term.CIGNA holds no direct residential mortgages.The weighted average loan to value ratio of the Companys commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2007 was approximately 62%.
18 CIGNA enters into joint ventures with local partners to develop, lease and manage, and sell commercial real estate to maximize investment returns.CIGNA's portfolio of real estate investments consists of properties under development and stabilized properties, and is diversified relative to property type and location.CIGNA also acquires real estate through foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans.CIGNA rehabilitates, re-leases and sells foreclosed properties, a process that usually takes from two to four years unless management considers a near-term sale preferable.Additionally, CIGNA invests in third party sponsored real estate funds to maximize investment returns and to maintain diversity with respect to its real estate related exposure.CIGNA did not sell any foreclosed properties in 2007.
Mezzanine and Private Equity Partnerships CIGNA invests in limited partnership interests in partnerships formed and managed by seasoned, experienced fund managers with diverse mezzanine and private equity strategies.
Derivative Instruments CIGNA generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize its exposure to certain market risks.CIGNA has also written derivative instruments to minimize certain insurance customers market risks.In addition, to enhance investment returns, CIGNA may invest in indexed credit default swaps or other credit derivatives from time to time.For information about CIGNAs use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 10(F) to CIGNAs 2007 Financial Statements on page 88 of this Form 10-K.
See also Investment Assets on page 60, and Notes 2, 10, and 11 to the Financial Statements on pages 71,86 and 91 of this Form 10-K for additional information about CIGNAs investments.
Domestic Portfolios  Investment Strategy As of December 31, 2007 the Domestic Portfolios had $16.1 billion in Invested Assets, allocated among fixed maturity investments (67%); commercial mortgage loan investments (20%); and policy loans, real estate investments and mezzanine and private equity partnership investments (13%).CIGNA realized gains of $32 million from sales of equity real estate investments in 2007.
CIGNA generally manages the characteristics of these assets to reflect the underlying characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities and related capital requirements, as well as regulatory and tax considerations pertaining to those liabilities, and state investment laws.CIGNAs domestic insurance and contractholder liabilities as of December 31, 2007, excluding liabilities of businesses sold through the use of reinsurance arrangements, were associated with the following products, and the Invested Assets are allocated proportionally as follows: other life and health, 18%; fully guaranteed annuity, 32%; and interest-sensitive life insurance, 50%.
While the businesses and products supported are described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the Invested Assets supporting CIGNA's insurance and contractholder liabilities related to each of its segments are as follows:  The       Invested Assets supporting CIGNAs Health Care operating segment are       structured to emphasize investment income, and provide the necessary       liquidity to meet cash flow requirements.
The       Invested Assets supporting CIGNA's Disability and Life operating segment       are also structured to emphasize investment income, and provide necessary       liquidity to meet cash flow requirements. Assets supporting longer-term       group disability insurance benefits and group life waiver of premium       benefits are generally managed to an aggregate duration similar to that of       the related benefit cash flows.
The       Invested Assets supporting CIGNA's Other Operations segment are associated       primarily with fully guaranteed annuities (primarily settlement annuities)       and interest-sensitive life insurance (primarily corporate-owned life       insurance products).Because settlement annuities generally do       not permit withdrawal by policyholders prior to maturity, the amount and       timing of future benefit cash flows can be reasonably estimated so funds       supporting these products are invested in fixed income investments that       generally match the aggregate duration of the investment portfolio with       that of the related benefit cash flows.As of December 31,       2007, the duration of assets that supported these liabilities was       approximately 12.4 years.
Invested Assets       supporting interest-sensitive life insurance products are primarily fixed       income investments and policy loans. Fixed income investments emphasize       investment yield while meeting the liquidity requirements of the related       liabilities.
19  The Invested Assets       supporting the Run-off Reinsurance segment with respect to guaranteed minimum       death benefit annuities and guaranteed minimum income benefit annuities       are structured to emphasize investment income, and provide the necessary       liquidity to meet cash flow requirements.For information about       CIGNAs use of derivative financial instruments in the Run-off Reinsurance       Segment, see Notes 7 and 20(B) to CIGNAs 2007 Financial Statements       on pages81 and99 of this Form     10-K.
Investment strategy and results are affected by the amount and timing of cash available for investment, competition for investments, economic conditions, interest rates and asset allocation decisions.CIGNA routinely monitors and evaluates the status of its investments in light of current economic conditions, trends in capital markets and other factors.Such factors include industry sector considerations for fixed maturity investments and mezzanine and private equity partnership investments, and geographic and property-type considerations for commercial mortgage loan and real estate investments.
International Portfolios  Investment Strategy As of December 31, 2007 the International portfolios had $1.4 billion in Invested Assets.The International portfolios are primarily managed by external managers with whom CIGNA's subsidiaries contract.
The characteristics of these assets are generally managed to reflect the underlying characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities, as well as regulatory and tax considerations in the countries where CIGNA's subsidiaries operate.Assets are generally invested in the currency of related liabilities, typically the currency in which the subsidiaries operate.CIGNA's investment policy allows the investment of subsidiary assets in U.S. dollars to the extent permitted by regulation.CIGNA's international Invested Assets as of December 31, 2007 were held in support of statutory surplus and liabilities associated with the types of insurance products described below.
Accident and health insurance consists of various individual group and individual life, accident and health products.Interest sensitive products primarily consist of return of premium products in which the nominal amount of premiums paid for a multi-year accident and health policy are paid back to the policyholder at the end of the contract period.Invested Assets supporting these products are fixed income investments that generally match the aggregate duration of the investment portfolio with that of the related benefit cash flows.
20 H .Run-off Reinsurance Principal Products and Markets Until 2000, CIGNA offered reinsurance coverage for part or all of the risks written by other insurance companies (or cedents) under life and annuity policies (both group and individual); accident policies (personal accident, catastrophe and workers' compensation coverages); and health policies.These products were sold principally in North America and Europe through a small sales force and through intermediaries.
In 2000, CIGNA sold its U.S. individual life, group life and accidental death reinsurance businesses.CIGNA placed its remaining reinsurance businesses (including its accident, domestic health, international life and health, and annuity reinsurance businesses) into run-off as of June 1, 2000 and stopped underwriting new reinsurance business.
Prior to 2000, CIGNA also purchased reinsurance to reduce the risk of losses on contracts that it had written.CIGNA determines its net exposure for run-off reinsurance contracts by estimating the portion of its policy and claim reserves that it expects will be recovered from its reinsurers (or retrocessionaires) and reflecting these in its financial statements as Reinsurance Recoverables, or, with respect to guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts discussed below, as Other Assets.
CIGNAs exposures stem primarily from its annuity reinsurance business, including its reinsurance of guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts, and its reinsurance of workers' compensation and other personal accident risks.
Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit Contracts CIGNAs reinsurance operations reinsured guaranteed minimum death benefits under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.These variable annuities are essentially investments in mutual funds combined with a death benefit.CIGNA has equity and other market exposures as a result of this product.
For additional information about guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts, see Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits under Run-off Reinsurance on page53 and Note 7 to CIGNA's 2007 Financial Statements on page80 of this Form 10-K.
Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit Contracts In certain circumstances where CIGNA's reinsurance operations reinsured the guaranteed minimum death benefit, CIGNA also reinsured guaranteed minimum income benefits under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies. These variable annuities are essentially investments in mutual funds combined with minimum income and death benefits.When annuitants elect to receive these minimum income benefits, CIGNA may be required to make payments which will vary based on changes in underlying mutual fund values and interest rates.CIGNA has retrocessional coverage for 55% of the exposures on these contracts, provided by two external reinsurers.
For additional information about guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts, see Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits under Run-off Reinsurance on page 54, and Note 20(B) to CIGNA's 2007 Financial Statements on page99 of this Form 10-K.
Workers' Compensation and Personal Accident CIGNA reinsured workers' compensation and other personal accident risks in the London market and in the United States.CIGNA purchased retrocessional coverage in these markets to substantially reduce the risk of loss on these contracts.Disputes involving a number of these reinsurance and retrocessional contracts have been substantially resolved and some of the disputed contracts have been commuted.For more information see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages35 and 36.
For more information see Run-off Reinsurance on page 53, and Note 8 to CIGNA's 2007 Financial Statements on page83 of this Form 10-K.
21 I .Regulation CIGNA and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and international regulations and CIGNA has established policies and procedures to comply with applicable requirements.
CIGNA's insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business.These subsidiaries are subject to numerous state and federal regulations related to their business operations, including, but not limited to:  the       form and content of customer contracts including benefit mandates       (including special requirements for small groupsgenerally under 50       employees);  premium       rates;  the       content of agreements with participating providers of covered       services;  producer       appointment and compensation;  claims       processing and appeals;  underwriting       practices;  reinsurance       arrangements;  unfair       trade and claim practices;  risk       sharing arrangements with providers; and  operation       of consumer-directed plans (including health savings accounts, health       reimbursement accounts, flexible spending accounts and debit       cards).
CIGNA also complies with regulations in international jurisdictions where foreign insurers are, in some countries, faced with greater restrictions than their domestic competitors. These restrictions may include discriminatory licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, required localization of records and funds, higher premium and income taxes, and requirements for local participation in an insurers ownership.
Other types of regulatory oversight are described below.
Regulation of Insurance Companies Financial Reporting Regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and HMOs.States regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements and the type and concentration of permitted investments.CIGNA's insurance and HMO subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their operations and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at regular intervals.
Guaranty Associations, Indemnity Funds, Risk Pools and Administrative Funds Most states and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds, which are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies.In the United States, these associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims.
Several states also require HMOs to participate in guaranty funds, special risk pools and administrative funds.For additional information about guaranty fund and other assessments, see Note 20(D) to CIGNAs 2007 Financial Statements on page100 of this Form 10-K.
Some states also require health insurers and HMOs to participate in assigned risk plans, joint underwriting authorities, pools or other residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards.
Solvency and Capital Requirements Many states have adopted some form of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model solvency-related laws and risk-based capital rules (RBC rules) for life and health insurance companies.The RBC rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held, the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred.If the ratio of the insurers adjusted surplus to its risk-based capital falls below statutory required minimums, the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship.
22 In addition, various non-U.S. jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency, liquidity and reserve coverage measures.
During 2007, CIGNAs HMOs and life and health insurance subsidiaries, as well as non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, were compliant with applicable RBC and non-U.S. surplus rules.
The NAIC is considering changing statutory reserving rules for variable annuities.Any changes would apply to CIGNA's reinsurance contracts covering guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income benefits, and would impact CIGNA's overall surplus level.
Holding Company Laws CIGNA's domestic insurance companies and certain of its HMOs are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies.Under such laws, certain dividends, distributions and other transactions between an insurance or HMO subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to, or approval by, one or more state insurance commissioners.
Oversight of Marketing, Advertising and Broker Compensation State and/or federal regulatory scrutiny of life and health insurance company and HMO marketing and advertising practices, including the adequacy of disclosure regarding products and their administration, may result in increased regulation. Products offering limited benefits, such as those issued in connection with the Star HRG business acquired in July 2006, may attract increased regulatory scrutiny.States have responded to concerns about the marketing, advertising and administration of insurance and HMO products and administrative practices by increasing the number and frequency of market conduct examinations and imposing larger penalties for violations of applicable laws and regulations.
In recent years, perceived abuses in broker compensation practices have been the focus of greatly heightened regulatory scrutiny.This increased regulatory focus may lead to legislative or regulatory changes that would affect the manner in which CIGNA and its competitors compensate brokers.For more information regarding general governmental inquiries relating to CIGNA companies, see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages35 and 36.
Licensing Requirements Pharmacy Licensure Laws Certain CIGNA companies are pharmacies which dispense prescription drugs to participants of benefit plans administered or insured by CIGNA subsidiary HMOs and insurance companies.These pharmacy-subsidiaries are subject to state licensing requirements and regulation.
Claim Administration, Utilization Review and Related Services CIGNA subsidiaries contract for the provision of claim administration, utilization management and other related services with respect to the administration of self-insured benefit plans. These CIGNA subsidiaries are subject to state licensing requirements and regulation.
Federal Regulations Employment Retirement Income Security Act CIGNA sells most of its products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by the Federal Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).CIGNA companies may be subject to requirements imposed by ERISA on plan fiduciaries and parties in interest, including regulations affecting claim and appeals procedures for health, dental, disability, life and accident plans.
Medicare Regulations Several CIGNA subsidiaries engage in businesses that are subject to federal Medicare regulations such as:  those       offering individual and group Medicare Advantage (HMO) coverage in       Arizona;  contractual       arrangements with the federal government for the processing of certain       Medicare claims and other administrative services;   and  those       offering Medicare Pharmacy (Part D) and Medicare Advantage Private       fee-for-service products that are subject to federal Medicare       regulations.
Federal Audits of Government Sponsored Health Care Programs Participation in government sponsored health care programs subjects CIGNA to a variety of federal laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted 23 under the programs (which may occur in years subsequent to provision by CIGNA of the relevant services under audit).These risks may include reimbursement claims as well as potential fines and penalties.For example, the federal government requires Medicare and Medicaid providers to file detailed cost reports for health care services provided.These reports may be audited in subsequent years.CIGNA HMOs that contract to provide community-rated coverage to participants in the federal Employees Health Benefit Plan may be required to reimburse the federal government if, following an audit, it is determined that a federal employee group did not receive the benefit of a discount offered by a CIGNA HMO to one of the two groups closest in size to the federal employee group.See Health Care in Section C beginning on page 2 for additional information about CIGNAs participation in government health-related programs.
Privacy and Information Disclosure and Portability Regulations The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes requirements for guaranteed issuance (for groups with 50 or fewer lives), electronic data security standards, and renewal and portability, on health care insurers and HMOs.In addition, HIPAA regulations required the assignment of a unique national identifier for providers by May, 2007.The federal government and states (as well as most non-U.S. jurisdictions) impose requirements regarding the use and disclosure of identifiable information about individuals and, in an effort to deal with the growing threat of identity theft, the handling of privacy and security breaches.
Antitrust Regulations CIGNA companies are also engaged in activities that may be scrutinized under federal and state antitrust laws and regulations.These activities include the administration of strategic alliances with competitors, information sharing with competitors and provider contracting.
Anti-Money Laundering Regulations Certain CIGNA lines of business are subject to United States Department of the Treasury anti-money laundering regulations.Those lines of business have implemented anti-money laundering policies designed to insure their affected products comply with the regulations.
Investment-Related Regulations Depending upon their nature, CIGNA's investment management activities are subject to U.S. federal securities laws, ERISA, and other federal and state laws governing investment related activities.In many cases, the investment management activities and investments of individual insurance companies are subject to regulation by multiple jurisdictions.
Regulatory Developments The business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs, particularly health care programs, is heavily regulated by federal and state laws and administrative agencies, such as state departments of insurance and the federal Departments of Labor and Justice, as well as the courts.In the growing area of consumer-driven plans, health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts are also regulated by the United States Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.For information on Regulatory and Industry Developments, see page56 in the MD&A section and Note 20(D) to CIGNA's 2007 Financial Statements on page100 of this Form 10-K.
Federal regulation and legislation may affect CIGNAs operations in a variety of ways.In addition to proposals discussed above related to increased regulation of the health care industry, other proposed federal measures that may significantly affect CIGNAs operations include calls for universal health care coverage, market reforms achieved through state and federal legislation, modifications of the Medicare program, and employee benefit regulation including modification to the tax treatment of employee benefits.
The economic and competitive effects of the legislative and regulatory proposals discussed above on CIGNAs business operations will depend upon the final form of any such legislation or regulation.
24 J .Ratings CIGNA and certain of its insurance subsidiaries are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the opinion of the rating agency, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capacity.
Insurance ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies. The principal agencies that rate CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries characterize their insurance rating scales as follows:  A.M.       Best Company, Inc. (A.M. Best), A++ to S (Superior to       Suspended);  Moodys       Investors Service (Moodys), Aaa to C (Exceptional to       Lowest);  Standard       & Poors Corp. (S&P), AAA to R (Extremely Strong to       Regulatory Action); and  Fitch,       Inc. (Fitch), AAA to D (Exceptionally Strong to Order of       Liquidation).
As of February 27, 2008, the insurance financial strength ratings for CIGNA subsidiaries, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CG Life) and Life Insurance Company of North America (LINA) were as follows: CG       Life LINA Insurance       Ratings (1) Insurance Ratings (1) A.M.       Best A A (Excellent, (Excellent, 3 rd of 16) 3 rd of 16) Moodys A2 A2 (Good, (Good, 6 th of 21) 6 th of 21) S&P A (Strong, 6 th of 21) Fitch A+ A+ (Strong, (Strong, 5 th of 24) 5th       of 24) _______________ (1) Includes the rating assigned, the       agencys characterization of the rating and the position of the rating in       the agencys rating scale (e.g., CG Lifes rating by A.M. Best is the 3rd       highest rating awarded in its scale of   16).
Debt ratings are assessments of the likelihood that a company will make timely payments of principal and interest.The principal agencies that rate CIGNAs senior debt characterize their rating scales as follows:  Moodys,       Aaa to C (Exceptional to Lowest);  S&P,       AAA to D (Extremely Strong to Default); and  Fitch,       AAA to D (Highest to Default).
The commercial paper rating scales for those agencies are as follows:  Moodys,       Prime-1 to Not Prime (Superior to Not   Prime);  S&P,       A-1+ to D (Extremely Strong to Default); and  Fitch,       F-1+ to D (Very Strong to Distressed).
25 As of February 27, 2008, the debt ratings assigned to CIGNA Corporation by the following agencies were as follows: Debt Ratings (1) CIGNA CORPORATION Commercial Senior       Debt Paper Moodys Baa2 P2 (Adequate, (Strong, 9 th of 21) 2 nd of 4) S&P BBB+ A2 (Adequate, (Good, 8 th of 22) 3 rd of 7) Fitch BBB+ F2 (Good, 8 th of 24) (Moderately       Strong, 3 rd of 7) ________________________ (1) Includes       the rating assigned, the agencys characterization of the rating and the       position of the rating in the applicable agencys rating       scale.
In February 2007, Moodys upgraded CIGNA Corporations senior debt rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and upgraded the financial strength ratings of CG Life and LINA to A2 from A3.At the same time, Moodys upgraded the commercial paper rating to P2 from P3.In March 2007, S&P upgraded CIGNA Corporations senior debt rating to BBB+ from BBB and upgraded the financial strength ratings of CG Life to A from A-.At the same time, Fitch upgraded CIGNA Corporations senior debt rating to BBB+ from BBB and upgraded the financial strength ratings of CG Life and LINA to A+ from A.CIGNA is committed to maintaining appropriate levels of capital in its subsidiaries to support finacial strengthratings that meet customers expectations, and to improving the earnings of the health care business. Lower ratings at the parent company level increase the cost to borrow funds. Lower ratings of CG Life could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business.
26 K .Miscellaneous Portions of CIGNAs insurance business are seasonal in nature. Reported claims under group health products are generally higher in the first quarter.
CIGNA and its principal subsidiaries are not dependent on business from one or a few customers. No customer accounted for 10% or more of CIGNAs consolidated revenues in 2007. CIGNA and its principal subsidiaries are not dependent on business from one or a few brokers or agents. In addition, CIGNAs insurance businesses are generally not committed to accept a fixed portion of the business submitted by independent brokers and agents, and generally all such business is subject to its approval and acceptance.
CIGNA had approximately 26,600, 27,100, and 28,000 employees as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
27 Item 1A .
RISK FACTORS CIGNAs businesses face risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. These factors represent risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on CIGNAs business, results of operations and financial condition.These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones CIGNA faces. Others risks and uncertaintiesthat CIGNA does not know about now, or that the Company does not now think are significant, may impair its business or the trading price of its securities.The following are significant risks identified by CIGNA.
If CIGNA does not execute on its strategic initiatives, there could be a material adverse effect on CIGNAs results of operations and in certain situations, CIGNA's financial condition .
The future performance of CIGNAs business will depend in large part on CIGNAs ability to execute effectively and implement its strategic initiatives. These initiatives include: executing CIGNA's consumer engagement strategy, including designing products to meet emerging market trends and ensuring that an appropriate infrastructure is in place to meet the needs of customers and members; continuing to reduce medical costs; market expansion, in particular in the individual and small business markets, as well as growth in medical and specialty membership; and further improving the efficiency of operations, including lowering operating costs and enabling higher value services.
Successful execution of these initiatives depends on a number of factors including:  the       ability to gain and retain customers and members by providing appropriate       levels of support and service for CIGNAs products, as well as avoiding       service and health advocacy related errors;  the       ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified       employees;  the       negotiation of favorable provider contracts;  CIGNA's       ability to develop and introduce new products or programs, because of the       inherent risks and uncertainties associated with product development,       particularly in response to government regulation or the increased focus       on consumer directed products;  the       identification and introduction of the proper mix or integration of       products that will be accepted by the marketplace;   and  the       ability of CIGNAs products and services to differentiate CIGNA from its       competitors and for CIGNA to demonstrate that these products and services       (such as disease management and health advocacy programs, provider       credentialing and other quality care initiatives) result in improved       health outcomes and reduced costs.
If CIGNA does not adequately invest in and effectively execute improvements in its information technology infrastructure and improve its functionality, it will not be able to deliver the service required in the evolving marketplace.
CIGNA's success in executing its consumer engagement strategy depends on the Companys continued improvements to its information technology infrastructure and customer service offerings. The marketplace is evolving and the level of service that is acceptable to consumers today will not necessarily be acceptable tomorrow. The Company must continue to invest in long term solutions that will enable it to meet customer expectations. CIGNA's success is dependent, in large part, on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support the Companys business processes in a cost-efficient and resource-efficient manner.CIGNA also must develop new systems to meet the current market standard and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs.
System development projects are long term in nature, may be more costly than expected to complete, and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion.If the Company does not effectively manage and upgrade its technology portfolio, CIGNA's operating results may be adversely affected.
If CIGNA fails to properly maintain the integrity or security of its data or to strategically implement new information systems, there could be a material adverse effect on CIGNAs business.
CIGNAs business depends on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data it uses to run its business.CIGNAs business strategy requires providing members and providers with Internet-enabled products and information to meet their needs. CIGNAs 28 ability to adequately price its products and services, establish reserves, provide effective and efficient service to its customers, and to timely and accurately report its financial results also depends significantly on the integrity of the data in its information systems.If the information CIGNA relies upon to run its businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error, or if CIGNA were to fail to maintain effectively its information systems and data integrity, the Company could have problems with, among other things:operational disruptions, which may impact customers, physicians and other health care providers; determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; retaining and attracting customers; and regulatory compliance.
If CIGNA were unable to maintain the security of any sensitive data residing on the Companys systems whether due to our own actions or those of any vendors, our reputation would be adversely affected and we could be exposed to litigation or other actions, fines or penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business or financial condition.
If premiums are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to members, or if CIGNAs estimates of medical claim reserves for its guaranteed cost and experience-rated businesses based upon estimates of future medical claims are inadequate, profitability could decline.
CIGNAs profitability depends, in part, on its ability to accurately predict and control future health care costs through underwriting criteria, provider contracting, utilization management and product design. Premiums in the health care business are generally fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, future cost increases in excess of medical cost projections reflected in pricing cannot generally be recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. Although CIGNA bases the premiums it charges on its estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period, actual costs may exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. Factors that may cause actual costs to exceed premiums include: medical cost inflation; higher than expected utilization of medical services; the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology; and membership mix.
CIGNA records medical claims reserves for estimated future payments. The Company continually reviews estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and makes necessary adjustments to its reserves. However, actual health care costs may exceed what was estimated.
If CIGNA fails to manage successfully its outsourcing projects and key vendors, CIGNAs financial results could be harmed .
CIGNA takes steps to monitor and regulate the performance of independent third parties who provide services or to whom the Company delegates selected functions. These third parties include information technology system providers, independent practice associations and specialty service providers.
In addition to the software applications and human resource operations support IBM had previously provided pursuant to several smaller contracts, in 2006, CIGNA entered into an agreement with IBM to operate significant portions of its information technology infrastructure, including the provision of services relating to its call center application, enterprise content management, risk-based capital analytical infrastructure and voice and data communications network.The 2006 contract with IBM includes several service level agreements, or SLAs, related to issues such as performance and job disruption with significant financial penalties if these SLAs are not met.However, the Company may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of the agreement. In addition, some of CIGNAs termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee, which may be significant.If CIGNA's relationship with IBM is terminated, the Company may experience disruption of service to customers, which could affect CIGNA's business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Arrangements with key vendors may make CIGNAs operations vulnerable if third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to the Company, as a result of their performance, changes in their own operations, financial condition, or other matters outside of CIGNAs control.Certain legislative authorities have in recent periods discussed or proposed legislation that would restrict outsourcing and, if enacted, could materially increase CIGNAs costs.Further, CIGNA may not fully realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of the outsourcing projects or other relationships it enters into with key vendors which could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact the Companys financial results.
29 A downgrade in the financial strength ratings of CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a downgrade in CIGNA's debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds.
Financial strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies.Ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. CIGNA believes the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of its principal insurance subsidiaries are an important factor in marketing its products to certain of CIGNAs customers.In addition, CIGNA Corporations debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings, and accordingly, its cost of capital. Each of the rating agencies reviews CIGNAs ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital and to support business growth at CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries.
As of February 27, 2008, the insurance financial strength ratings for CG Life, the Companys principal insurance subsidiary, were as follows: CG       Life Insurance       Ratings (1) A.M.       Best A (Excellent, 3 rd of 16) Moodys A2 (Good, 6 th of 21) S&P A (Strong, 6 th of 21) Fitch A+ (Strong, 5 th of 24) ___________ (1) Includes the rating assigned, the agencys characterization of the rating and the position of the rating in the agencys rating scale (e.g., CG Lifes rating by A.M. Best is the 3rd highest awarded in its scale of 16).
A description of CIGNA Corporation ratings, other subsidiary ratings, as well as more information on these ratings, is included in Ratings in Section J beginning on page 25.
Unfavorable claims experience related to workers compensation and personal accident insurance exposures in CIGNAs Run-off Reinsurance business could result in losses .
Unfavorable claims experience related to workers compensation and personal accident insurance exposures in CIGNAs run-off reinsurance business is possible and could result in future losses. Further, CIGNA could have losses attributable to its inability to recover amounts from retrocessionaires or ceding companies either due to disputes with the retrocessionaires or ceding companies or their financial condition.If CIGNAs reserves for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires or ceding companies, as well as reserves associated with underlying reinsurance exposures are insufficient, it could result in losses.
If CIGNAs program for its guaranteed minimum death benefits contracts fails to reduce the risk of stock market declines, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition.
As part of its run-off reinsurance business, CIGNA reinsured a guaranteed minimum death benefit under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.CIGNA adopted a program to reduce equity market risks related to these contracts by selling domestic and foreign-denominated exchange-traded futures contracts.The purpose of this program is to reduce the adverse effects of potential future domestic and international stock market declines on CIGNAs liabilities for these contracts.Under the program, increases in liabilities under the annuity contracts from a declining equity market are offset by gains on the futures contracts.However, if CIGNA were to have difficulty in entering into appropriate futures contracts, or stock market declines expose CIGNA to higher rates of partial surrender (which are not covered by the program), there could be a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition.See Run-off Reinsurance in Section H on page 21 for more information on the program.
If actual experience differs significantly from CIGNAs assumptions used in estimating CIGNAs liabilities for reinsurance contracts covering guaranteed minimum death benefits or minimum income benefits, it could have a material adverse effect on CIGNAs consolidated results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on CIGNA's financial condition.
30 CIGNA estimates reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit and minimum income benefit exposures are based on assumptions regarding lapse, partial surrender, mortality, interest rates, volatility, reinsurance recoverables, and, for minimum income benefit exposures, annuity income election rates.These estimates are currently based on CIGNAs experience and future expectations.CIGNA monitors actual experience to update these reserve estimates as necessary.CIGNA regularly evaluates the assumptions used in establishing reserves and changes its estimates if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.Further, CIGNA could have losses attributable to its inability to recover amounts from retrocessionaires.
Significant stock market declines could result in increased pension plan expenses and the recognition of additional pension obligations.
CIGNA has a pension plan that covers a large number of current employees and retirees. Unfavorable investment performance due to significant stock market declines or changes in estimates of benefit costs, if significant, could adversely affect CIGNAs results of operations or financial condition by significantly increasing its pension plan expenses and obligations.
Significant changes in market interest rates affect the value of CIGNA's financial instruments that promise a fixed return and, as such, could have an adverse effect on CIGNA's results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
As an insurer, CIGNA has substantial investment assets that support its policy liabilities. Generally low levels of interest rates on investments, such as those experienced in United States financial markets during recent years, have negatively impacted the level of investment income earned by the Company in recent periods, and such lower levels of investment income would continue if these lower interest rates were to continue.
Substantially all of the Companys investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities, fixed redeemable preferred securities andcommercial mortgage loans.The value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions.A rise in interest rates could reduce the value of the Companys investment portfolio and increase interest expense if CIGNA were to access its available lines of credit. The Company is also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with the Companys pension and other post-retirement obligations and certain guaranteed benefit products.Sustained declines in interest rates or equity returns could have an adverse impact on the funded status of the Companys pension plans, the ultimate benefit payout on these guaranteed products, and the Companys re-investment yield on new investments.
New accounting pronouncements or guidance may require CIGNA to change the way in which it accounts for operations and may affect the Companys financial results.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other regulatory bodies may issue new accounting standards or pronouncements, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards or pronouncements, from time to time, which could have a significant effect on CIGNA's reported results for the affected period.
CIGNA faces risks related to litigation and regulatory investigations.
CIGNA is routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits, investigations and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of the business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs, including benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements.In addition, CIGNA incurs and likely will continue to incur liability for claims related to its health care business, such as failure to pay for or provide health care, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged, provider disputes, including disputes over compensation, and claims related to self-funded business. Also, there are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the industry.In addition, CIGNA is involved in pending and threatened litigation arising out of its run-off reinsurance and retirement operations.
Court decisions and legislative activity may increase CIGNAs exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages may be sought. CIGNA currently has insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the entire damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability 31 may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.
A description of material legal actions in which CIGNA is currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages35 and36 and Note 20(E) to CIGNAs 2007 Financial Statements on page101 of this Form 10-K. The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur.CIGNA believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously.Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or more legal matters could result in losses material to CIGNAs consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
CIGNAs business is subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with new regulation, could increase its costs of doing business and could adversely affect its profitability.
CIGNAs business is regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels. The laws and rules governing CIGNAs business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force CIGNA to change how it does business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase health care, technology and administrative costs including pension costs and capital requirements, take other actions such as changing our reserve levels with respect to certain reinsurance contracts, and increase CIGNAs liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions.
CIGNA must comply with the various regulations applicable to its business.If CIGNA fails to comply, the Companys business could be adversely affected.In addition, CIGNA must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of its products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate some of its acquisitions and divestitures. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce the Companys revenue or increase its costs.
For further information on regulatory matters relating to CIGNA, see Regulation in Section I on page 22 and Legal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages 35 and 36.
CIGNA operates a pharmacy benefit management business, which is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in addition to those CIGNA faces with its health care business.
CIGNA's pharmacy benefit management business is subject to federal and state regulation, including: the application of federal and state anti-remuneration laws; compliance requirements for pharmacy benefit manager fiduciaries under ERISA, including compliance with fiduciary obligations under ERISA in connection with the development and implementation of items such as formularies, preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs, contracting network practices, specialty drug distribution and other transactions and potential liability regarding the use of patient-identifiable medical information; and federal and state laws and regulations related to the operation of Internet and mail-service pharmacies.Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could affect the Companys business, results of operations, and financial condition.Furthermore, a number of federal and state legislative proposals are being considered that could adversely affect a variety of pharmacy benefit industry practices, including without limitation, the receipt of rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers, the regulation of the development and use of formularies, and legislation imposing additional rights to access drugs for individuals enrolled in managed care plans.
The Companys pharmacy benefit management business would also be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and could suffer claims and reputational harmin connection with purported errors by CIGNA's mail order or retail pharmacy businesses.Disruptions at any of the Company's pharmacy business facilities due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce CIGNA's ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to customers, which could negatively impact the Companys business, results of operations, and financial condition.
CIGNA faces competitive pressure, particularly price competition, which could reduce product margins and constrain growth in CIGNAs health care businesses.
While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service quality of clinical resources, claims 32 administration services and medical management programs, and quality and sufficiency of provider networks, CIGNA expects that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. CIGNAs customer contracts are subject to negotiation as customers seek to contain their costs, and customers may elect to reduce benefits in order to constrain increases in their benefit costs. Such an election may result in lower premiums for the Companys products, although it may also reduce CIGNAs costs. Alternatively, the Companys customers may purchase different types of products that are less profitable, or move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums.
In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the health care industry giving rise to speculation and uncertainty regarding the status of companies, which potentially can affect marketing efforts and public perception. Consolidation may make it more difficult for the Company to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which CIGNA does business with its suppliers, or to maintain its position or increase profitability. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite increasing medical costs.For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act gives banks and other financial institutions the ability to affiliate with insurance companies, which may lead to new competitors with significant financial resources in the insurance and health benefits fields.If CIGNA does not compete effectively in its markets, if the Company sets rates too high in highly competitive markets to keep or increase its market share, if membership does not increase as it expects, or if it declines, or if CIGNA loses accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, CIGNAs product margins and growth could be adversely affected.
Public perception of CIGNA's products and practices as well as of the health benefits industry, if negative, could reduce enrollment in CIGNAs health benefits programs.
The health care industry in general, and CIGNA specifically, are subject to negative publicity, which can arise either from perceptions regarding the industry or CIGNA's business practices or products.This risk may be increased as CIGNA offers new products, such as products with limited benefits or an integrated line of products, targeted at market segments, beyond those in which CIGNA traditionally has operated. Negative publicity may adversely affect the CIGNA brand and its ability to market its products and services, which could reduce the number of enrollees in CIGNA's health benefits programs and adversely affect CIGNAs profitability.
Large-scale public health epidemics, bio-terrorist activity, natural disasters or other extreme events could cause CIGNAs covered medical and disability expenses, pharmacy costs and mortality experience to rise significantly, and in severe circumstances, could cause operational disruption.
If widespread public health epidemics such as an influenza pandemic, bio-terrorist or other attack, or catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, CIGNAs covered medical and disability expenses, pharmacy costs and mortality experience could rise significantly, depending on the governments actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurers.In addition, depending on the severity of the situation, a widespread outbreak could curtail economic activity in general, and CIGNA's operations in particular, which could result in operational and financial disruption to CIGNA, which among other things may impact the timeliness of claims and revenue.
CIGNA's business depends on the uninterrupted operation of its systems and business functions, including information technology and other business systems.
CIGNAs business is highly dependent upon its ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, its necessary business functions, such as: claims processing and payment; internet support and customer call centers; and the processing of new and renewal business. A power outage, pandemic, or failure of one or more of information technology, telecommunications or other systems could cause slower system response times resulting in claims not being processed as quickly asclients desire, decreased levels of client service and client satisfaction, and harm to CIGNA's reputation. In addition, because CIGNAs information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, CIGNA could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption,systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of CIGNAs ability to pay claims in a timely 33 manner, provide customer service, write and process new and renewal business, or perform other necessary corporate functions. This could result in a materially adverse effect on CIGNAs business results and liquidity.
A security breach of CIGNAs computer systems could also interrupt or damage CIGNAs operations or harm CIGNA's reputation. In addition, CIGNA could be subject to liability if sensitive customer information is misappropriated from CIGNAs computer systems. These systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any publicized compromise of security could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in the growth of customers, increased operating expenses, financial losses, additional litigation or other claims, which could have a material adverse effect on CIGNAs business.
CIGNA is focused onfurther developing its business continuity program to address the continuation of core business operations. While CIGNA continues to test and assess itsbusiness continuity program to satisfy the needs of CIGNAscore business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event.
CIGNA faces a wide range of risks, and its success depends on its ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage its enterprise risk exposure.
As a large company operating in a complex industry, CIGNA encounters a variety of risks as identified in this Risk Factor discussion. CIGNA devotes resources to developing enterprise-wide risk management processes, in addition to the risk management processes within its businesses. Failure to appropriately identify and manage these risks, as well as the failure to identify and take advantage of appropriate opportunities, can materially affect CIGNAs profitability, its ability to retain or grow business, or, in the event of extreme circumstances, CIGNAs financial condition.
CIGNA faces risks relating to its ability to effectively deploy its capital.
CIGNAs operations have generated significant capital in recent periods and the Company has significant ability to raise additional capital. In deploying its capital to fund its investments in operations, share repurchases, potential acquisitions or other capital uses, CIGNA's financial results could be adversely affected if it does not appropriately balance its risks and opportunities.
CIGNA is subject to potential changes in the political environment which affects public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products.
While it is not possible to predict when and whether fundamental policy changes would occur, these could include policy changes on the local, state and federal level that could fundamentally change the dynamics of CIGNAs industry, such as a much larger role of the government in the health care arena.Changes in public policy could materially affect CIGNA's profitability, its ability to retain or grow business, or in the event of extreme circumstances, its financial condition.
If CIGNA does not successfully manage the pending acquisition and integration of Great-West Healthcare (or any other acquisition), its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
CIGNA entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Great-West Healthcare with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits, including, among others, a broader distribution and provider network in certain geographic areas, an expanded range of health benefits and products, cost savings, increased profitability of the acquired business by improving its total medical cost position, and achievement of operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether CIGNA integrates Great-West Healthcare in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could limit CIGNAs ability to grow membership particularly in the small business segment, result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy and could materially impact CIGNAs business, results of operations, and financial condition.
CIGNA faces intense competition to attract and retain key people.
CIGNA would be adversely impacted if it failed to attract additional key people and retain current key people as this could result in the inability to effectively execute the Companys key initiatives and business strategy.

Item 3 .
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CIGNA is routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory and IRS audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of the business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs.An increasing number of claims are being made for substantial non-economic, extra-contractual or punitive damages.The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence can occur.CIGNA believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously.Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could result in losses material to CIGNAs consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
In re Managed Care Litigation On April 7, 2000, several pending actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in a multi-district litigation proceeding captioned In re Managed Care Litigation .The consolidated cases include Shane v. Humana, Inc., et al.
(CIGNA subsidiaries added as defendants in August 2000), Mangieri v. CIGNA Corporation (filed December 7, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama), Kaiser and Corrigan v. CIGNA Corporation, et al.
(class of health care providers certified on March 29, 2001) and Amer. Dental Assn v. CIGNA Corp. et. al.
(a putative class of dental providers).
In 2004, the Court approved a settlement agreement between the physician class and CIGNA.A dispute over disallowed claims under the settlement submitted by a representative of certain class member physicians is proceeding to arbitration.Separately, in April 2005, the Court approved a settlement between CIGNA and a class of non-physician health care providers.Only the Amer. Dental Assn case remains unresolved.CIGNA's motion to dismiss the case is pending.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, pursuant to a settlement, CIGNA received a favorable $22 million pre-tax ($14 million after tax) insurance recovery related to this litigation.In the first quarter of 2007, CIGNA received an additional $5 million pre-tax ($3 million after-tax) insurance recovery related to this litigation.CIGNA is pursuing further recoveries from two additional insurers.
Broker Compensation Beginning in 2004, CIGNA, other insurance companies and certain insurance brokers received subpoenas and inquiries from various regulators, including the New York and Connecticut Attorneys General and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation relating to their investigations of insurance broker compensation.CIGNA received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California in October 2005 and the San Diego District Attorney in March 2006 and has provided information to them about a broker, Universal Life Resources (ULR). On June 6, 2007, the Company received a letter from the San Diego District Attorney, detailing its potential claims and penalties against the Company subsidiaries, and outlining potential civil litigation.The Company denies the allegations and will vigorously defend itself in the event of litigation.In addition, in January 2006, CIGNA received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Labor and is providing information to that Office about another broker.CIGNA is cooperating with the inquiries and investigations.
On November 18, 2004, The People of the State of California by and through John Garamendi, Insurance Commissioner of the State of California v. Universal Life Resources, et al . was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego alleging that defendants (including CIGNA and several other insurance holding companies) failed to disclose 35 compensation paid to ULR and that, in return for the compensation, ULR steered clients to defendants.The plaintiff sought injunctive relief only.On July 9, 2007, the parties to this lawsuit entered into a non-monetary settlement in which some of CIGNA's subsidiaries agreed to maintain certain disclosure practices regarding contingent compensation.This settlement does not resolve the regulators claim for recovery of attorneys fees and costs.
On August 1, 2005, two CIGNA subsidiaries, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and Life Insurance Company of North America, were named as defendants in a consolidated amended complaint filed in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation , a multi-district litigation proceeding consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The complaint alleges that brokers and insurers conspired to hide commissions, increasing the cost of employee benefit plans, and seeks treble damages and injunctive relief. Numerous insurance brokers and other insurance companies are named as defendants.
The court permitted plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which plaintiffs did on May 22, 2007.The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the federal antitrust, RICO and state law claims and a motion to dismiss and for summary judgment regarding the ERISA fiduciary claims.On August 31, 2007, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the federal antitrust claims.On September 28, 2007, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs RICO claims.On January 14, 2008, the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants as to plaintiffs ERISA claims.On February 13, 2008, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs' state law claims and the complaint in its entirety.The court ordered the clerk to enter judgment against plaintiffs and in favor of the defendants.Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.
CIGNA denies the allegations and will continue to vigorously defend itself.
Amara Cash Balance Pension Plan Litigation On December 18, 2001, Janice Amara filed a purported class action lawsuit, now captioned Janice C. Amara, Gisela R. Broderick, Annette S. Glanz, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. CIGNA Corporation and CIGNA Pension Plan, in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against CIGNA Corporation and the CIGNA Pension Plan on behalf of herself and other similarly situated participants in the CIGNA Pension Plan affected by the 1998 conversion to a cash balance formula.The plaintiffs allege various ERISA violations including, among other things, that the Plans cash balance formula discriminates against older employees; the conversion resulted in a wear away period (during which the pre-conversion accrued benefit exceeded the post-conversion benefit); and these conditions are not adequately disclosed in the Plan. The plaintiffs were granted class certification on December 20, 2002, and seek equitable relief.A non-jury trial began on September 11-15, 2006. Due to the courts schedule, the proceedings were adjourned and the trial was completed on January 25, 2007.On February 15, 2008, the court issued a decision finding in favor of CIGNA Corporation and the CIGNA Pension Plan on the age discrimination and wear away claims and finding in favor of the plaintiffs on many aspects of the disclosure claims.The court has ordered the parties to file simultaneous briefs on March 17, 2008 regarding the relief, if any, to be awarded to the plaintiffs on the claims on which the plaintiffs prevailed, and to file responsive briefs on March 31, 2008. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself.
Run-off Reinsurance Litigation In connection with CIGNA's Run-off reinsurance operations, described on page 21, CIGNA purchased extensive retrocessional reinsurance for its Unicover contracts and also for some other segments of its non-Unicover business.During 2007 CIGNA entered into a settlement that resolved the appeal of an adverse court award in a retrocessional enforcement arbitration. That appeal, captioned CIGNA EUROPE INSURANCE COMPANY SA-NV v. John Hancock Life Insurance Company was pending in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court and the case was dismissed in the fourth quarter of 2007.Other disputes concerning retrocessional contracts have been substantially resolved or settled.The effect of these settlements has been reflected in the results of the Run-off Reinsurance segment, which is discussed on page 53.

Reclassifications Certain insignificant reclassifications have been made to prior years' amounts to conform to the presentation of 2007 amounts.
Overview The Company constitutes one of the largest investor-owned health service organizations in the United States. Its subsidiaries are major providers of health care and related benefits, the majority of which are offered through the workplace, including health care products and services such as: medical coverages, pharmacy, behavioral health, dental benefits, and disease management, group disability, life and accident insurance; and disability and workers compensation case management and related services.In addition, the Company has an international operation that offers life, accident and supplemental health insurance products and international health care products and services to businesses and individuals in selected markets. The Company also has certain inactive businesses, including a run-off reinsurance operation.See Business  Item 1 in the Companys Form 10-K for additional information on its segments.
The Company generates revenues, net income and cash flow from operations by:  maintaining       and growing its customer base;  charging       prices that reflect emerging experience;  investing       available cash at attractive rates of return for appropriate durations;       and  effectively       managing other operating expenses.
The Companys ability to increase revenue, net income and operating cash flow is directly related to its ability to address broad economic and industry factors and execute its strategic initiatives, the success of which is measured by certain key factors as discussed below.
Key factors affecting the Companys results include:  the       ability to profitably price products and services at competitive       levels;  the       volume of customers served and the mix of products and services purchased       by those customers;  the       Companys ability to cross sell its various health and related benefit       products;  the       relationship between other operating expenses and revenue;     and  the       effectiveness of the Companys capital deployment     initiatives.
The Companys results are influenced by a range of economic and other factors, especially:  cost       trends and inflation for medical and related   services; 39  utilization       patterns of medical and other services;  employment       levels;  the       tort liability system;  developments       in the political environment both domestically and       internationally;  interest       rates, equity market returns and foreign currency       fluctuations;  regulations       and tax rules related to the administration of employee benefit plans;       and  federal       and state regulation.
The Company regularly monitors the trends impacting operating results from the above mentioned key factors and economic and other factors.The Company develops strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize its competitive position in the markets it serves.The Companys ability to achieve its financial objectives is dependent upon its ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends.
The Company is continuing to improve the performance of and profitably grow the health care operations; as well as continuing to profitably grow the disability and life insurance and international businesses; and managing the risks associated with the run-off reinsurance operations.In the health care businesses, the Company has operational improvement initiatives (see pages 50-52) in place to: (1) offer       products that meet emerging consumer and market   trends; (2) underwrite       and price products effectively; (3) grow       medical membership; (4) effectively       manage medical costs; (5) deliver       quality member and provider service; (6) maintain       and upgrade information technology systems; and (7) reduce       other operating expenses.
The Company believes that the health care business model is evolving to one that focuses more directly on the role and needs of the health care consumer.The consumer-directed environment presents particular challenges by requiring a more complex service model and products specifically designed to meet the emerging market needs of the consumer.In order to meet the emerging market challenges, the Company is investing in product development, service, technology, educational resources and customer support tools to assist consumers in making more informed choices regarding their health care and to achieve better health outcomes. These investments and execution of related initiatives are critical to respond to increasing consumer demands.The Company believes that its investments in these areas will position it to more effectively meet emerging market needs and better position the Company to be a leader in the health care industry.

Special Items In order to facilitate an understanding and comparison of results of operations and permit analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses andincome from continuing operations, the following table presents special items, which management believes are not representative of the underlying results ofoperations.See Quarterly Financial Data on page 104 for special items reported quarterly in 2007 and 2006.
SPECIAL       ITEMS Pre-Tax After-Tax Benefit Benefit (In       millions) (Charge) (Charge) 2007 Completion       of IRS examination $ - $ 23 Reserve       charge on guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts (86 ) (56 ) Total $ (86 ) $ (33 ) 2006 Charge       associated with settlement of shareholder litigation $ (38 ) $ (25 ) Cost       reduction charge (37 ) (23 ) Total $ (75 ) $ (48 ) 2005 Accelerated       amortization of deferred gain       on sale of retirement benefits business $ 322 $ 204 Cost       reduction charge (51 ) (33 ) IRS       tax settlement 6 81 Charge       associated with a modified coinsurance       arrangement (12 ) (8 ) Total $ 265 $ 244 40 Special items for 2007 consisted of:  previously       unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the completion of the IRS       examination for the 2003 and 2004 tax years; and  a       charge for changes in the long-term assumptions for annuitization and       lapse rates for guaranteed minimum income benefit     contracts.
Special items for 2006 consisted of:  a       charge associated with the settlement of the shareholder class action       lawsuit brought against the Company.This charge included       certain costs to defend and was net of expected insurance recoveries;       and  a       charge for severance costs resulting from a review of staffing levels in       the Health Care operations and in supporting   areas.
Special items for 2005 consisted of:  accelerated       amortization of deferred gain on the sale of the retirement benefits       business;  a       charge for severance costs associated with streamlining the operations of       the Health Care operations and supporting areas.The Company       substantially completed this program in 2006;  a       tax benefit primarily from the release of tax reserves and valuation       allowances resulting from the completion of the IRS audit for years       2000-2002; and  a       charge associated with a modified coinsurance arrangement resulting from       the sale of the retirement benefits business in   2004.
The impact of these special items on the segments is shown in the Results of Operations table within each segment discussion.
Overview of 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations Income from continuing operations excluding the special items discussed above decreased in 2007, compared with 2006, principally reflecting lower realized investment gains primarily due to lower gains from sales of equity interests in real estate limited liability entities of $145 million.
These factors were partially offset by higher earnings in the Health Care (see page 48), Disability and Life (see page 52), International (see page 53) and Run-off Reinsurance (see page 53) segments.
Overview of 2006 Consolidated Results of Operations Income from continuing operations in 2006, excluding the special items discussed above, increased compared to 2005 principally reflecting:  improved       realized investment results primarily due to sales of equity interests in       real estate limited liability entities of $165 million       after-tax;  lower       losses in the Run-off Reinsurance segment; and  higher       earnings in the International segment driven by growth in the expatriate       employee benefits business and the life, accident and health insurance       business.
These factors were partially offset by lower segment earnings in the Health Care segment (see page 48).
Outlook for 2008 The Company expects full year 2008 income from continuing operations, excluding realized investment results, the results of the guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB) business and special items, to be higher than the comparable 2007 amount primarily due to earnings growth in the Health Care, Disability and Life and International segments, tempered by lower earnings in the Run-off Reinsurance segment.
The Companys outlook is subject to the factors cited in the Cautionary Statement on page 64.
Management is not able to estimate 2008 income from continuing operations under generally accepted accounting principles because it includes realized investment gains (losses), the results of the GMIB business and special items. Information is not available for management to reasonably estimate future realized investment gains (losses), the results of the GMIB business under a new accounting standard (see Note 2(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements) or special (non-recurring) items, due, in part, to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors.
Revenues The Companys revenues are derived from a variety of sources.See Note 2(S) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Total revenue increased by 7% in 2007, compared with 2006 and decreased by 1% in 2006, compared with 2005.Changes in the components of total revenue are described more fully below.
Premiums and Fees Premiums and fees increased 10% in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily attributable to higher specialty revenues and growth in medical membership as well as strongrenewal pricing on existing businessin the Health Care segment (see page 48) and strong business growth in theDisability and Life (see page 52) and International segments (see page 53).
Premiums and fees decreased marginally in 2006 reflecting the loss of a large prescription drug contract of $1.1 billion.Excluding the loss of this contract, premiums and fees increased 9% in 2006, compared with 2005 primarily due to membership growth and rate increases in the Health Care, Disability and Life and International segments (see pages 48-53).
41 Net Investment Income Net investment income decreased 7% in 2007.This decrease was primarily attributable to share repurchase activity and lower average assets driven by a decline in the Health Care segment resulting from:  a       shift in business from guaranteed cost products to administrative services       only (ASO) products; and  pre-funding       of Medicare Part D claims.
Net investment income decreased 12% in 2006 as a result of the 2006 conversion of the single premium annuity business to indemnity reinsurance (see page55 for additional information) and share repurchase activity.
Net investment income also reflects the impact of yields, which were lower in 2007 and higher in 2006 as a result of changes in interest rates.
Mail Order Pharmacy Revenues Mail order pharmacy revenues in 2007 were comparable to 2006.Mail order pharmacy revenues increased 30% in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to higher volume.
Other Revenues Other revenues for the Company include certain Health Care specialty products, including behavioral health and disease management, results from futures contracts in the run-off reinsurance operations and amortization of deferred gains associated with sold businesses.
Other revenues increased 6% in 2007, as compared with 2006, primarily due to lower losses from futures contracts in the run-off reinsurance operations partially offset by lower other revenues in the Disability and Life segment (see page 52).
Other revenues decreased 54% in 2006, as compared with 2005, primarily due to lower deferred gain amortization associated with the sold retirement benefits business and higher losses from futures contracts in the run-off reinsurance operations.
Realized Investment Gains (Losses) Realized investment gains (losses) were higher in 2006, compared with 2007 and 2005, primarily due to sales of equity interests in real estate limited liability entities.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:  it       requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the       estimate was made; and  changes       in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could       have a material effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations       or financial condition.
Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below.
In addition to the estimates presented in the following table, there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements, including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits other than those identified in the following table, as well as estimates with respect to unpaid claims and claim expenses, postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions, certain compensation accruals, and income taxes.
Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements are appropriate.However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity and financial condition.
See Note 2(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact the Company.
42 The       table that follows presents information about the Companys most critical       accounting estimates, as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in       the material assumptions used to develop each estimate.
Balance       Sheet Caption / Nature       of Critical Estimate Item Assumptions       / Approach Used Effect       if Different Assumptions Used Future       policy benefits Guaranteed       minimum death benefits These       liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to       be paid, less the present value of net future premiums expected to be       received.The amounts to be paid represent the excess of the       guaranteed death benefit over the values of contractholders       accounts.The death benefit coverage in force at December 31,       2007 (representing the amount payable if all approximately 750,000       contractholders had died as of that date) was approximately $4.2       billion.
Liabilities       for future policy benefits for these contracts as of December 31 were as       follows:  2007       $848 million  2006        $862 million The       Company estimates these liabilities based on assumptions for lapse,       partial surrender, mortality, interest rates (mean investment performance       and discount rate), and volatility.These assumptions are based       on the Companys experience and future expectations over the long-term       period.The Company monitors actual experience to update these       estimates as necessary.
Lapse       refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to a contractholders       death.
Partial       surrender refers to the fact that most contractholders have the ability to       withdraw substantially all of their mutual fund investments while       retaining any available death benefit coverage in effect at the time of       the withdrawal.Equity market declines could expose the Company       to higher rates of partial surrender, the effect of which is not covered       by the Companys program to substantially reduce market risks.
Interest       rates include both (a) the mean investment performance assumption       considering the Company's program to reduce equity market exposures using       futures contracts, and (b) the liability discount rate       assumption.
Volatility       refers to market fluctuations that affect the costs of the program adopted       by the Company to reduce equity market risks associated with these       liabilities.
Current       assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in Note 7 to       the Consolidated Financial Statements.If an unfavorable change       were to occur to those assumptions, the approximate after-tax decrease in       net income would be as follows:  10%       increase in mortality rates - $50 million  10% decrease inlapse rates - $20       million  10% increase in future partial surrenders - $5       million  50 basis point decrease ininterest       rates:  Mean Investment Performance - $30       million  Discount Rate - $20 million  10% increase in volatility - $35       million The       amounts would be reflected in the Run-off Reinsurance     segment.
Health       Care medical claims payable Medical       claims payable for the Health Care segment include both reported claims       and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported.
Liabilities       for medical claims payableas of December 31 were as       follows:  2007       gross $975 million; net $717 million  2006        gross $960 million; net $710 million  2005        gross $1.2 billion; net $823 million These       liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and       other recoverables.
These       liabilities generally exclude amounts for administrative services only       business.
See       Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional       information.
The       Company develops estimates for Health Care medical claims payable using       actuarial principles and assumptions based on historical and projected       claim payment patterns, medical cost trends, which are impacted by the       utilization of medical services and the related costs of the services       provided (unit costs), benefit design, seasonality, and other relevant       operational factors.The Company consistently applies these       actuarial principles and assumptions each reporting period, with       consideration given to the variability of these factors, and recognizes       the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of       confidence, as required by actuarial standards of practice, which require       that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse       conditions.
The       Company's estimate of the liability for medical claims incurred but not       yet reported is primarily calculated using historical claim payment       patterns and expected medical cost trends.The Company analyzes       the historical claim payment patterns by comparing the dates claims were       incurred, generally the dates services were provided, to the dates claims       were paid to determine completion factors, which are a measure of the       time to process claims.A completion factor is calculated for       each month of incurred claims.The Company uses historical       completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and       operational factors to develop current estimates of completion       factors.The Company estimates the ultimate liability for       claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of       completion factors to the current paid claim data.The       difference between this estimate of the ultimate liability and the current       paid claim data is the estimate of the remaining claims to be paid for       each incurral month.These monthly estimates are aggregated and       included in the Company's Health Care medical claims payable at the end of       each For       the year ended December 31, 2007, actual experience differed from the       Company's key assumptions, resulting in $80 million of favorable incurred       claims related to prior years medical claims payable of 1.3% of the       current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended December 31,       2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, actual experience differed       from the Company's key assumptions, resulting in $173 million of favorable       incurred claims related to prior years medical claims, or 2.6% of the       current year incurred claims reported for the year ended December 31,       2005.Specifically, the favorable impact is due to faster than       expected completion factors and lower than expected medical cost trends,       both of which included an assumption for moderately adverse       experience.
The       corresponding impact of favorable prior year development on net income was       $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $54 million for the       year ended December 31, 2006.The change in the amount of the       incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable       liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in the       Company's net income.See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial       Statements for additional information.
Recent       variances were 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2.6% for the       year ended December 31, 2006 related to the impact of the prior year       medical claims payable; and 0.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and       0.8% for the year 43 reporting       period.Completion factors are used to estimate the health care       medical claims payable for all months where claims have not been       completely resolved and paid, except for the most recent month as       described below.
Completion       factors are impacted by several key items including changes in the level       of claims processed electronically versus manually (auto-adjudication),       changes in provider claims submission rates, membership changes and the       mix of products.As noted, the Company uses historical       completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and       operational factors to develop current estimates of completion       factors.This approach implicitly assumes that historical       completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current       period.It is possible that the actual completion rates for the       current period will develop differently from historical patterns, which       could have a material impact on the Company's medical claims payable and       net income.
Claims       incurred in the most recent month have limited paid claim data, since a       large portion of health care claims are not submitted to the Company for       payment in the month services have been provided.This makes       the completion factor approach less reliable for claims incurred in the       most recent month.As a result, in any reporting period, for       the estimates of the ultimate claims incurred in the most recent month,       the Company primarily relies on medical cost trend analysis, which       reflects expected claim payment patterns and other relevant operational       considerations.Medical cost trend is impacted by several key       factors including medical service       utilization and unit costs and the Companys ability to manage these       factors through benefit design, underwriting, provider contracting and the       Company's medical management initiatives.These factors are       affected by changes in the level and mix of medical benefits offered,       including inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy, the impact of copays and       deductibles, changes in provider practices and changes in consumer       demographics and consumption behavior.
Because       historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim       trends, the trend experienced for the most recent history along with an       analysis of emerging trends, have been taken into consideration in       establishing the liability for medical claims payable at December 31, 2007       and 2006.It is possible that the actual medical trend for the       current period will develop differently from the expected, which could       have a material impact on the Company's medical claims payable and net       income.
For       each reporting period, the Company evaluates key assumptions by comparing       the assumptions used in establishing the medical claims payable to actual       experience. When actual experience differs from the assumptions used in       establishing the liability, medical claims payable are increased or       decreased through current period net income.Additionally, the       Company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends which       may impact key assumptions.The estimation process involves       considerable judgment, reflecting the variability inherent in forecasting       future claim payments.The adequacy of these estimates is       highly sensitive to changes in the Company's key assumptions, specifically       completion factors, which are impacted by actual or expected changes in       the submission and payment of medical claims, and medical cost trends,       which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the utilization of       medical services and unit costs.
See       Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional       information.
ended       December 31, 2006 related to the impact on net income. The Company       believes that based on the current mix of business as of December 31,       2007, relative to the health care medical claims payable, the annual       impact of each 1% variance between the actual and expected incurred       medical claims on the Companys net income would be approximately $35       million, favorable or unfavorable dependent on the direction of the actual       versus expected variance.
Based       on the current mix of business, the Company would reasonably expect the       variance between actual and expected incurred medical claims to be within       the range of +/- 0% to 1%.This potential variance is expected       to be driven evenly by completion factors and monthly medical cost       trends.While these ranges are consistent with the more recent       variation in actual completion factors and medical trend assumptions,       including the impact of recent operational and environmental changes,       there is significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of actual       results versus individual assumptions, and accordingly, more precision is       not appropriate.
The       amounts would be reflected in the Health Care   segment.
44 Balance       Sheet Caption / Nature       of Critical Estimate Item Assumptions       / Approach Used Effect       if Different Assumptions Used Accounts       payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and Other assets       - Guaranteed       minimum income benefits These       liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to       be paid, less the present value of net future premiums expected to be       received.The amounts to be paid represent the excess of the       expected value of the income benefit over the value of the annuitants       accounts at the time of annuitization.
The       assets associated with these contracts represent receivables in connection       with reinsurance that the Company has purchased from two external       reinsurers, which covers 55% of the exposures on these       contracts.
Net       liabilities related to these contracts as of December 31 were as follows:  2007       $313 million  2006        $88 million As       of December 31, net amounts recoverable related to these contracts from       two external reinsurers were as follows:  2007       $197 million  2006        $46 million Additional       liabilities associated with the cost of reinsurance as of December 31 were       as follows:  2007       $24 million  2006        $47 million As       discussed in Note 2(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the       Company will implement SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, on January       1, 2008.The new requirements that focus on exit price to       measure fair value will impact the current assumptions and resulting       estimated fair value of assets and liabilities for guaranteed minimum       income benefits and are expected to reduce the Company's net income at       implementation between $125 million to $150 million, net of estimated       reinsurance recoverable.
The       Company estimates the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated       with these contracts using assumptions as to market returns and volatility       of the underlying equity and bond mutual fund investments, interest rates,       mortality, lapse, credit risk and annuity election       rates.Changes in fair value are reported in other operating       expenses.
Annuity       election rates refer to the proportion of annuitants who elect to receive       their income benefit as an annuity.
Lapse       refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to annuitization of the       policy.
The       Company has been monitoring annuity election rate experience and, in 2007,       increased its assumption related to annuity election rates resulting in a       charge (net of reinsurance) of $75 million pre-tax. Also in 2007, the       Company completed a review of lapse experience for these contracts. As a       result of the review, the Company decreased its lapse assumption resulting       in a charge (net of reinsurance) of $11 million pre-tax; because fewer       annuitants are expected to lapse coverage, the Companys expected claims       increase.In combination, the Company recognized in the second       quarter of 2007 a total charge of $56 million after-tax ($86 million       pre-tax) for these changes in the long-term assumptions.This       charge is reflected as a special item (see page 40).
Credit       risk refers to the ability of these reinsurers to pay.
Interest       rates include both (a) the liability discount rate assumption and (b) the       projected interest rates used to calculate the reinsured income benefit at       the time of annuitization (claim interest rate).
Volatility       refers to the degree of variation of future market returns of the       underlying mutual fund investments.
After       implementation of SFAS 157, the Company will consider the various       assumptions used to estimate fair values of assets and liabilities       associated with these contracts in two categories.The first       group of assumptions consists of future annuitant behavior including       annuity election rates, lapse, and mortality as well as retrocessionnaire       credit risk.Current assumptions used to estimate these       liabilities are detailed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial       Statements.The Company will estimate a hypothetical market       participant's view of these assumptions considering the actual and       expected experience of the Company and other relevant and available       industry sources.If an unfavorable change were to occur in       these assumptions before the implementation of SFAS No. 157, the       approximate after-tax decrease in net income, net of estimated reinsurance       recoverable, would be as follows:  10%       decrease in mortality - less than $1 million  10%       increase in annuity election rates -$5 million  10%       decrease in lapse rates $3 million  10%       decrease in amounts recoverable from reinsurers (credit risk) - $10       million After       the implementation of SFAS No. 157, the potential effects on net income of       unfavorable changes in these assumptions are generally expected to be 50%       to 100% more than noted above, primarily because the liabilities, net of       reinsurance recoverable will be higher at the date of       implementation.In addition to these assumptions, the Company       will estimate a risk and profit charge that a hypothetical market       participant would require to assume this business.
The       second group of assumptions used to estimate these fair values consist of       capital markets inputs including market returns and discount rates, claim       interest rates and market volatility.After the implementation       of SFAS No. 157, the Company's results of operations are expected to be       more volatile in future periods because these assumptions will be based       largely on market-observable inputs at the close of each period including       risk free interest rates and market implied volatilities.If       the following unfavorable changes were to occur after the implementation       of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008, the approximate after-tax decrease in       net income, net of estimated reinsurance recoverable, would be as       follows:  50       basis point decrease in risk free interest rates (which are aligned with       LIBOR) used for projecting market returns and discounting - $15 to $20       million  50       basis point decrease in interest rates used for projecting claim exposure       (7 year Treasury rates) - $30 million  10%       increase in market volatility - $5 million In       addition, if annuitants' account values as of December 31, 2007 declined       by 10% due to the performance of the underlying mutual funds, the       approximate after-tax decrease in net income net of estimated reinsurance       recoverable would be approximately $35 million.
All       of these estimated impacts due to unfavorable changes could vary from       quarter to quarter depending on actual reserve levels, the actual market       conditions or changes in the anticipated view of a hypothetical market       participant as of any future valuation date.
The       amounts would be reflected in the Run-off Reinsurance       segment.See Note 2(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements       for further information.
45 Balance       Sheet Caption / Nature       of Critical Estimate Item Assumptions       / Approach Used Effect       if Different Assumptions Used Reinsurance       recoverables Reinsurance       recoverables in Run-off       Reinsurance Collectibility       of reinsurance recoverables requires an assessment of risks that such       amounts will not be collected, including risks associated with reinsurer       default and disputes with reinsurers regarding applicable       coverage.
Gross       and net reinsurance recoverables in the Run-off Reinsurance segment as of       December 31, were as follows:  2007        gross $203 million; net $191 million  2006        gross $506 million; net $360 million  2005        gross $565 million; net $417 million The       amount of reinsurance recoverables in the Run-off Reinsurance segment, net       of reserves, represents managements best estimate of recoverability,       including an assessment of the financial strength of       reinsurers.The ultimate amounts received are dependent, in       certain cases, on the resolution of disputes with reinsurers, including       the outcome of arbitration and litigation proceedings.
A       10% reduction of net reinsurance recoverables due to uncollectibility at       December 31, 2007, would reduce net income by approximately $15 million       after-tax.
The       amounts would be reflected in the Run-off Reinsurance segment.
See       Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional       information.
Accounts       payable, accrued expensesand other liabilities-pension       liabilities These       liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and       nonqualified pension benefits to be paid (attributed to employee service       to date) net of the fair value of plan assets.The accrued pension       benefit liabilityas of December 31 was as follows:  2007       $628 million  2006        $843 million See       Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional       information.
The       Company estimates these liabilities with actuarial models using various       assumptions including discount rates and an expected return on plan       assets.
Discount       rates are set considering actual annualized yields for high quality,       long-term corporate bonds, adjusted to reflect the duration of the pension       liabilities.
The       expected return on plan assets for the domestic qualified pension plan is       developed considering actual historical returns, current and expected       market conditions, plan asset mix and managements investment       strategy.In addition, to measure pension costs the Company       uses a market-related asset value method for domestic qualified pension       plan assets invested in non-fixed income investments, which are       approximately 80% of total plan assets.This method recognizes       market appreciation or depreciation in the non-fixed income portfolio over       5 years, a method that reduces the short-term impact of market       fluctuations on pension cost.
The       declining interest rate environment has resulted in an accumulated       unrecognized actuarial loss of $0.4 billion at December 31,       2007.The actuarial loss adjusted for unrecognized changes in       market-related asset values is amortized over the remaining service life       of pension plan participants if the loss exceeds 10% of the market-related       value of plan assets or 10% of the projected benefit obligation, whichever       is greater.As of December 31, 2007, approximately $0.3 billion       of the adjusted actuarial loss exceeded 10% of the projected benefit       obligation. As a result, approximately $35 million after-tax will be       expensed in 2008 net income.For the year ended December 31,       2007, $77 million after-tax was expensed in net income.
Changes       to the Company's assumptions for discount rates and the expected return on       domestic qualified plan assets will not change required cash contributions       to the pension plan, as the Company funds at least the minimum amount       required by ERISA.Using past experience, the Company expects       that it is reasonably possible that a favorable or unfavorable change in       these key assumptions of 50 basis points could occur.An       unfavorable change is a decrease in these key assumptions with resulting       impacts as discussed below.
If       discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased       by 50 basis points:  annual       pension costs for 2008 would increase by approximately $15 million,       after-tax; and  the       accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately $200       million as of December 31, 2007 resulting in an after-tax decrease to       shareholders equity of approximately $130 million as of December 31,       2007.
If       the expected return on domestic qualified pension plan assets decreased by       50 basis points, annual pension costs for 2008 would increase by       approximately $10 million, after-tax.
If       the December 31, 2007 fair values of domestic qualified plan assets       decreased by 10%, the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by       approximately $340 million as of December 31, 2007 resulting in an       after-tax decrease toshareholders equity of approximately       $220 million.
A       favorable change is an increase in these key assumptions and would result       in impacts to annual pension costs, the accrued pension liability and       shareholders equity in an opposite direction, but similar       amounts.
46 Balance       Sheet Caption / Nature       of Critical Estimate Item Assumptions       / Approach Used Effect       if Different Assumptions Used Investments        Fixed maturities Recognition       of losses from other than       temporary impairments of public       and private placement fixed       maturities Losses       for other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities must be       recognized in net income based on an estimate of fair value by       management.
Changes       in fair value are reflected as an increase or decrease in shareholders       equity.A decrease in fair value is recognized in net income       when the decrease is determined to be other than temporary.
Determining       whether a decline in value is other than temporary includes an       evaluation of the reasons for and the significance of the decrease in       value of the security as well as the duration of the decrease.
Management       estimates the amount of an other than temporary impairment when a       decline in value is expected to persist, using quoted market prices for       public securities with active markets and generally the present value of       future cash flows for private placement bonds and other public       securities.Expected future cash flows are based on historical       experience of the issuer and managements expectation of future       performance.See Quality Ratings on page60 for       additional information.
The       Company recognized "other than temporary" impairments of investments in       fixed maturities as follows (after-tax, excluding policyholder       share):  2007       $20 million  2006       $18 million  2005       $12 million See       Note 10(A) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of       the Companys review of declines in fair value.
For       all fixed maturities with cost in excess of their fair value, if this       excess was determined to be other-than-temporary, the Company's net income       as of December 31, 2007 would have decreased by approximately $81 million       after-tax.
For       private placement bonds considered impaired, a decrease of 10% of all       expected future cash flows for the impaired bonds would reduce net income       by approximately $1 million after-tax.
47 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating segments generally reflect groups of related products, but the International segment is generally based on geography.The Company measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings (loss), which is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding realized investment gains (losses).Beginning in 2007, the Company reports the results of the run-off retirement business in Other Operations.Prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment information and a reconciliation of segment earnings (loss) to the Companys consolidated income from continuing operations.
Health Care Segment Segment Description The Health Care segment includes medical, dental, behavioral health, prescription drug and other products and services that may be integrated to provide consumers with comprehensive health care solutions.This segment also includes group disability and life insurance products that were historically sold in connection with certain experience-rated medical products that continue to be managed within the health care business.
These products and services are offered through guaranteed cost, retrospectively experience-rated andservice funding arrangements.For a description of funding arrangements, see page5 in this Form 10-K.
The company measures the operating effectiveness of the Health Care segment using the following key factors:  segment       earnings;  membership       growth;  sales       of specialty products to core medical customers;  changes       in operating expenses per member; and  medical       expense as a percentage of premiums (medical cost ratio) in the guaranteed       cost business.
Results of Operations (In       millions) Financial       Summary 2007 2006 2005 Premiums       and fees $ 10,666 $ 9,830 $ 10,177 Net       investment income 202 261 275 Mail       order pharmacy revenues 1,118 1,145 883 Other       revenues 250 226 208 Segment       revenues 12,236 11,462 11,543 Mail       order pharmacy cost of       goods sold 904 922 690 Benefits       and other expenses 10,295 9,534 9,804 Benefits       and expenses 11,199 10,456 10,494 Income       before taxes 1,037 1,006 1,049 Income       taxes 358 353 361 Segment       earnings $ 679 $ 653 $ 688 Realized       investment gains, net       of taxes $ 14 $ 105 $ 1 Special       item (after-tax) included in segment earnings: Cost       reduction charge $ - $ (15 ) $ (14 ) The Health Care segment's earnings in all years presented were impacted by favorable after-tax prior year claim development of $8 million, $54 million and $137 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The amount of prior year claim development recorded in 2007, compared with 2006, is lower due to actual medical cost trends and completion factors being more in line with initial assumptions.
The amount of prior year claim development recorded in 2006 and in 2005 was attributable to better than expected completion factors reflecting shorter claims processing times due to more timely submission of claims as well as higher auto adjudication rates. Additionally, lower than expected medical cost trends also contributed to the favorable results. These results were driven by lower inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy service utilization and successful provider contracting initiatives as well as the mix of services provided.
Excluding such prior year claim development and the special items noted in the table above, segment earnings in 2007 increased over 2006 due to:  increased       earnings from the specialty businesses;  margin       improvements in the stop-loss product;  a       lower medical cost ratio in the guaranteed cost business of 160 basis       points due to strong renewal pricing increases in excess of medical cost       trend; and  aggregate       medical membership growth of approximately 800,000 members,       includinggrowth in the voluntary/ limited benefits       business.
These factors were partially offset by lower margins in the experience-rated business as well as lower net investment income due to lower average assets and lower yields.
Excluding prior year claim development and the special items noted in the table above, segment earnings for 2006 were higher than 2005 due to:  higher       earnings from the specialty businesses associated with core medical       members;  higher       medical membership of approximately 300,000   members;  improved       cost productivity from expense reduction initiatives reflected in lower       operating costs per member; and  lower       losses in the Medicare Part D program of $11 million       after-tax.
These factors were partially offset by lower results in the guaranteed cost business reflecting premium increases which were less than medical cost increases and lower experience-rated earnings.
48 Revenues The table below shows premiums and fees for the Health Care segment: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Medical: Commercial       HMO 2 $ 2,220 $ 2,744 $ 2,646 Open       access/Other guaranteed       cost 3 1,657 946 463 Voluntary/limited       benefits 160 72 - Total       guaranteed cost 1 4,037 3,762 3,109 Experience-rated       medical 1,       4 1,877 1,760 2,836 Dental 773 776 899 Medicare 349 321 286 Medicare       Part D 6 326 215 - Other       medical 5 1,062 929 926 Total       medical 8,424 7,763 8,056 Life       and other non-medical 235 305 399 Total       premiums 8,659 8,068 8,455 Fees 1,6 2,007 1,762 1,722 Total       premiums and fees $ 10,666 $ 9,830 $ 10,177 1 Premiums and/or fees associated with certain specialty products are also included.
2 Includes premiums of $82 million for 2006 associated with the health care members in Tucson, Arizona (see Medical Membership below).
3 Includes premiums associated with other risk-related products primarily open access products.
4 Includes minimum premium members, who have a risk profile similar to experience-rated funding arrangements.The risk portion of minimum premium revenue is reported in experience-rated medical premium whereas the self funding portion of minimum premium revenue is recorded in fees.
5 Other medical premiums include risk revenue for stop-loss and specialty products.
6 Represent administrative service fees for medical members and related specialty product fees for non-medical members as well as fees related to Medicare Part D.
Premiums and fees.
Premiums and fees increased 9% in 2007, compared with 2006, primarily reflecting:  strong       renewal pricing on existing business, particularly in the guaranteed cost       business;  higher       Medicare Part D premiums of $111 million;  growth       in specialty revenues; and  aggregate       medical membership growth, including the voluntary/ limited benefits       business.
In addition, premiums and fees in 2007 reflect a change in the mix of products to more service-only products from guaranteed cost products.
Premiums and fees reflect the loss in 2006 of a large prescription drug contract of $1.1 billion in the experience-rated business.The loss of this contract had minimal impact to earnings, however the final settlement of this contract did result in net cash outflows in 2006.
Excluding the loss of this contract, premiums and fees increased by 9% in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to increased guaranteed cost membership and rate increases, as well as premiums and fees associated with the Medicare Part D and voluntary/limited benefits businesses.
Other revenues.
Other revenues for the Health Care segment consist of revenues earned on direct channel sales of certain specialty products, including behavioral health and disease management.
Other revenues increased 11% in 2007 and 9% in 2006 primarily due to business growth.
Benefits and Expenses Health Care segment benefits and expenses consist of the following: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Medical       claims expense $ 6,798 $ 6,111 $ 6,305 Other       benefit expenses 225 260 347 Mail       order pharmacy cost       of goods sold 904 922 690 Other       operating expenses 3,272 3,163 3,152 Total       benefits and expenses $ 11,199 $ 10,456 $ 10,494 Medical claims expense.
Medical claims expense included favorable prior year claim development of $12 million in 2007, $83 million in 2006 and $211 million in 2005.Excluding the prior year claim development, medical claims expense increased 10% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to medical trend, increased Medicare Part D membership and the impact of the Star HRG operations.The increase in medical claims expense for the guaranteed cost business was more than offset by the increase in premiums as demonstrated by the improvement in the medical cost ratio to 84.2% from 85.8%.
Excluding prior year claim development and the loss of a large prescription drug contract, medical claims expense increased 14% in 2006, compared with 2005. This increase was due to the impact of medical trend as demonstrated by a worsening in the medical cost ratio in the guaranteed cost business to 85.8% from 84.1%, the introduction of Medicare Part D in 2006 and the impact of Star HRG, which was acquired in July 2006.
See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about medical claims payable and medical claims expense.
Other operating expenses.
Other operating expenses include expenses related to both retail and mail order pharmacy, disease management, voluntary and limited benefits and Medicare claims administration businesses .
Excluding these items, other operating expenses increased in 2007, compared with 2006, reflecting membership growth and higher spending on information technology, including market facing capabilities.This increase was partially offset by productivity savings which were reflected in lower operating expenses per member due to the success of various expense reduction initiatives.
49 Other operating expenses for 2006 include the favorable impact of a $22 million pre-tax ($14 million after-tax) insurance recovery resulting from a litigation matter.Other operating expenses increased in 2006 reflecting costs associated with certain revenue growth initiatives and amortization of software development.Excluding these items, other operating expenses for 2006 reflect productivity improvements.
Other Items Affecting Health Care Results Medical Membership The Company's medical membership includes any individual for whom the Company retains medical underwriting risk, who uses the Companys network for services covered under their medical coverage or for whom the Company administers medical claims.
(In       thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Guaranteed       cost: Commercial       HMO 523 764 813 Medicare 31 32 32 Open       access/Other guaranteed       cost 1 515 366 214 Total       guaranteed cost, excluding voluntary/limited       benefits 1,069 1,162 1,059 Voluntary/limited       benefits 180 164 - Total       guaranteed cost 1,249 1,326 1,059 Experience-rated 2 907 935 1,129 Service 3 8,013 7,128 6,902 Total       medical membership 10,169 9,389 9,090 1 Includes membership associated with other risk-related products, primarily open access products.
2 Includes minimum premium members, who have a risk profile similar to experience-rated funding arrangements.The risk portion of minimum premium revenue is reported in experience-rated medical premium whereas the self funding portion of minimum premium revenue is recorded in fees.
3 Includes approximately 25 thousand members obtained through the acquisition of Mid-South Administrative Group, LLC, which was effective January 1, 2007, and includes 340 thousand members related to Sagamore Health Network, which was acquired on August 1, 2007.
During 2007, medical membership increased by 8.3%, including members from the August 1, 2007 acquisition of Sagamore Health Network, Inc.Excluding this acquisition, medical membership increased 4.7% due to growth in the service business.
During 2006, the Company's medical membership increased by 3% including approximately 164,000 members with voluntary or other limited health care benefits coverage as a result of the Star HRG acquisition in 2006.Excluding this acquisition, medical membership increased 1.5% reflecting growth in service and other guaranteed cost, partially offset by lower experience-rated membership.
In 2006, approximately 54,000 health care members in Tucson, Arizona were transitioned to the Company as the result of an antitrust requirement to divest certain contracts in connection with the merger of two health care industry competitors.Given the unique nature of this transaction, the Company did not include these members in its reported medical membership until affected customers renewed on the Companys contracts.As of December 31, 2007, all customers were up for renewal and the Company renewed contracts for approximately 36,000 members.These members are now included in the above medical membership results.
In addition, in 2006, approximately 84,000 members were reclassified from experience-rated to administrative service only.This change had no impact on reported revenues or segment earnings.
Operational Improvement Initiatives The Company continues to devote its efforts to becoming the leading health service organization.As such, the Company is focused on several initiatives including developing and enhancing a consumer focused service model.This effort is expected to require significant investments over the next 3-5 years.These investments will enable the Company to grow its membership and to improve operational effectiveness and profitability by developing innovative products and services that promote consumer engagement at a competitive cost.Executing on these operational improvement initiatives is critical to attaining a leadership position in the health care marketplace.
Offering products that meet emerging consumer and market trends.
The CIGNATURE, CareAllies SM , and CIGNA Choice Fund suite of products offers various options to consumers and employers and are key to our consumer engagement strategy.Offerings include: choice of benefit, participating provider network, funding, medical management, and health advocacy options.Through the CIGNA Choice Fund, the Company offers a set of consumer-directed capabilities that includes options for health reimbursement arrangements and/or health savings accounts and enables consumers to make effective health decisions using information tools provided by the Company.
In July 2006, the Company acquired Star HRG, a leading provider of low cost health plans and other employee benefits coverage for hourly and part-time workers and their families.This acquisition complements the Companys existing product portfolio by giving the Company the capability to offer voluntary health insurance coverage.Also in 2006, the Company acquired vielife, a U.K. based leading provider of integrated online health management and coaching programs and entered into a long-term agreement with the University of Michigan to access certain intellectual property related to identification of health risks and employer worksite health and wellness programs.
Underwriting and pricing products effectively.
One of the Companys key priorities is to achieve strong profitability in a competitive health care market.The Company is focused on effectively managing pricing and underwriting decisions at both the case and overall business level, particularly for the 50 guaranteed cost business as demonstrated in the improvement in the guaranteed cost medical cost ratio by 160 basis points in 2007 excluding prior year claim development.
Growing medical membership results.
The Company continues to focus on growing its medical membership by:  increasing       its share of the national and regional segments;  providing       a diverse product portfolio that meets current market needs as well as       emerging consumer-directed trends;  developing       and implementing the systems, information technology and infrastructure to       deliver member service that keeps pace with the emerging consumer-directed       market trends;  ensuring       competitive provider networks; and  maintaining       a strong clinical quality in medical, specialty health care and disability       management.
The Company is focused onsegment expansion most notably in the voluntary, individual and small employer (less than 200 employees) and senior segments.In an effort to achieve these objectives, the Company took the following strategic actions: In November 2007, the Company announced its agreement to acquire Great-West Healthcare of Denver, Colorado. This acquisition will enable the Company to broaden its distribution reach and provider network, particularly in the western regions of the United States, and expand the range of health benefits and products it offers.The Company is targeting an April 1, 2008 closing date.See Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook on page58 for more information about funding this acquisition.
Additionally, the Company acquired Memphis-based Mid-South Administrative Group, LLC in January 2007 to give the Company an expanded local presence in Memphis and western Tennessee.
The Company formed strategic alliances with New York-based MVP Health Care/Preferred Care in September 2006 and with Minnesota-based HealthPartners in April 2006.The Company believes that its medical management model, focus on clinical quality and ability to integrate health and related benefit solutions position the Company to continue to improve membership results.
These actions have enabled the Company to strengthen its national provider network; to enhance its ability to provide superior medical disease management programs and importantly, to grow membership while lowering medical costs in key geographic areas.
Effectively managing medical costs.
The Company operates under a centralized medical management model, which helps facilitate consistent levels of care for its members and reduces infrastructure expenses.
The Company is focused on continuing to effectively manage medical utilization and unit costs.To help achieve this, the Company continues to focus on renegotiating contracts with providers and certain facilities to limit increases in medical reimbursement costs.In addition, the Company seeks to strengthen its network position in selected markets and, on August 1, 2007, acquired Sagamore Health Network, Inc. in Indiana. Sagamore provides access to an extensive preferred provider network and offers access to a broad range of utilization review and case management services to health claim payer organizations, self-insured employers and third-party administrators.In the future, the Company may pursue additional acquisitions and strategic alliances.
Delivering quality member and provider service.
The Company is focused on delivering competitive service to members, providers and customers. The Company believes that further enhancing quality service can improve member retention and, when combined with useful health information and tools, can help motivate members to become more engaged in their personal health, and will promote healthy outcomes thereby removing cost from the system.The evolution of the consumer-driven healthcare market is driving increased product and service complexity and is raising consumers expectations with respect to service levels, which is expected to require significant investment, management attention and heightened interaction with customers.
The Company is focused on the development and enhancement of a service model that is capable of meeting the challenges brought on by the increasing product and service complexity and the heightened expectations of health care consumers.The Company continues to invest in the development and implementation of systems and technology to improve the member and provider service experience, enhance its capabilities and improve its competitive position.
Maintaining and upgrading information technology systems.
The Companys current business model and long-term strategy require effective and reliable information technology systems.The Companys current systems architecture will require continuing investment to meet the challenges of increasing consumer demands from both our existing and emerging customer base to support its business growth and strategies, improve its competitive position and provide appropriate levels of service to consumers.The Company is focused on providing these enhanced strategic capabilities in response to increasing consumer expectations, while continuing to provide a consistent, high quality consumer service experience with respect to the Companys current programs.Further integration of the Companys multiple administrative and customer facing platforms is required to support the Company's internal needs and growth strategies, and to ensure reliable, efficient and effective customer service both in todays employer focused model as well as in a consumer directed model.The Companys ability to obtain and effectively deploy capital to make these investments will influence the timing and the impact these initiatives will have on its operations.
51 Reducing other operating expenses.
The Company operates in an intensely competitive marketplace and its ability to establish a meaningful cost advantage is key to achieving its initiatives. Accordingly, the Company continues to focus on initiatives that will increase its operating efficiency and responsiveness to customers.
The Companys health advocacy capabilities support its recent membership growth.The Company must be able to deliver those capabilities efficiently and cost-effectively.The Company must continue to identify additional cost savings to further improve its competitive cost position.Savings generated from the Companys operating efficiency initiatives provide capital to make investments that will enhance its capabilities in the areas of consumerism, particularly product development, the delivery of member service and health advocacy and related technology. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on initiatives to reduce operating expenses.
Disability and Life Segment Segment Description The Disability and Life segment includes group disability, life, accident and specialty insurance and case management for disability and workers compensation.
For a description of Disability and Lifes products and services, see page 11 in the Business section of this Form 10-K.
Key factors for this segment are:  premium       growth, including new business and customer   retention;  net       investment income;  benefits       expense as a percentage of earned premium (loss ratio);   and  other       operating expense as a percentage of earned premiums (expense       ratio).
Results of Operations (In       millions) Financial       Summary 2007 2006 2005 Premiums       and fees $ 2,374 $ 2,108 $ 2,065 Net       investment income 276 256 264 Other       revenues 131 161 198 Segment       revenues 2,781 2,525 2,527 Benefits       and expenses 2,435 2,214 2,208 Income       before taxes 346 311 319 Income       taxes 92 85 92 Segment       earnings $ 254 $ 226 $ 227 Realized       investment gains (losses),       net of taxes $ (5 ) $ 6 $ (4 ) Special       item (after-tax) included in segment       earnings: Completion       of IRS examination $ 6 $ - $ - Segment results in 2007 include the net favorable impact of reserve studies of $12 million after-tax.Segment results in 2006 include the net favorable impact of reserve studies of $28 million after-tax, partially offset by severance charges of $6 million. Results in 2005 include the net favorable impact of reserve studies of $17 million after-tax.
Excluding the impact of reserve studies and the special item noted in the table above, segment earnings increased in 2007, compared with 2006, driven by continued strong disability results, higher net investment income due to higher average assets and yields, and more favorable accident and group universal life claims experience.In addition, segment earnings reflect effective operating expense management and strong earned premium growth.
Excluding the impact of the reserve studies, segment earnings decreased in 2006, compared with 2005 driven by lower net investment income due to lower average assets partially offset by higher yields and lower earnings in the workers' compensation case management business.
Revenues Premiums and fees.
Premiums and fees increased 13% in 2007 and 2% in 2006 primarily reflecting business growth from new and existing customers and strong customer retention primarily in the disability and life insurance business while maintaining competitively strong margins.
Other revenues . Other revenues decreased 19% in 2007, compared with 2006, due to the loss of a significant customer in the workers compensation case management business in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Other revenues decreased 19% in 2006, compared with 2005, due to cancellations in the workers compensation case management business.
Benefits and Expenses Excluding the pre-tax impact of reserve studies, the increase in benefits expense in 2007, compared with 2006, was primarily related to the net growth in earned premiums which was partially offset by more favorable mortality experience in the accident and specialty businesses.The loss ratio in the disability business remained constant while the loss ratio in the accident and specialty businesses improved in 2007.
Excluding the pre-tax impact of reserve studies, the increase in benefits expense in 2006, compared with 2005, was related to the growth in earned premiums offset by favorable mortality in the life and accident insurance businesses, and more favorable disability claims experience.
2006 operating expenses include an $11 million pre-tax charge for severance.Excluding this charge, other operating expense decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily reflecting lower workers' compensation case management expenses due to declining business volumes, partially offset by business 52 growth in the disability, life and accident businesses.The expense ratio improved reflecting effective operating expense management.Excluding the severance charge, other operating expenses increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily reflecting business growth in the disability, life and accident businesses, partially offset by lower workers compensation case management expenses due to declining business volumes.The expense ratio increased slightly due to investments in information systems.
International Segment Segment Description The International segment includes life, accident and supplemental health insurance products and international health care products and services, including those offered to expatriate employees of multinational corporations.
The key factors for this segment are:  premium       growth, including new business and customer   retention;  benefits       expense as a percentage of earned premium (loss ratio);   and  operating       expense as a percentage of earned premium (expense   ratio).
Results of Operations (In       millions) Financial       Summary 2007 2006 2005 Premiums       and fees $ 1,800 $ 1,526 $ 1,243 Net       investment income 77 79 71 Other       revenues 7 2 (4 ) Segment       revenues 1,884 1,607 1,310 Benefits       and expenses 1,612 1,394 1,155 Income       before taxes 272 213 155 Income       taxes 96 75 46 Segment       earnings $ 176 $ 138 $ 109 Realized       investment gains (losses),       net of taxes $ 1 $ (1 ) $ - Special       item (after-tax) included in segment       earnings: Completion       of IRS examination $ 2 $ - $ 7 Excluding the special item noted in the table above, International segment earnings increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to substantial earnings growth in the life, accident and health insurance business, particularly in South Korea, and in the expatriate employee benefits business.
Revenues Premiums and fees.
The increases in premiums and fees of 18% in 2007 and 23% in 2006, were primarily attributable to new sales growth and strong customer retention in the life, accident and health insurance operations, particularly in South Korea, and in the expatriate employee benefits business.These increases also reflect appropriate renewal pricing on existing business.
Premiums and fees, excluding the effect of foreign currency changes, were $1,745 million in 2007, $1,494 million in 2006 and $1,202 million in 2005.
Benefits and Expenses Benefits and expenses increased 16% in 2007 and 21% in 2006, primarily due to business growth, particularly in South Korea.While benefits and expenses increased in 2007, the loss ratio improved in the life, accident and health business. In addition, expense ratios in the life, accident and health and expatriate benefitsbusinesses continue to be strong due to effective expense management.
Other Items Affecting International Results South Korea represents the single largest geographic market for the Companys international businesses.In 2007, South Korea generated 31% of Internationals revenues and 41% of its segment earnings.Due to the concentration of business in this region, the Companys International business in South Korea could be exposed to potential losses resulting from adverse consumer credit conditions and geopolitical and economic conditions in that country, which could have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results.
Run-off Reinsurance Segment Segment Description The Companys reinsurance operations were discontinued and are now an inactive business in run-off mode since the sale of the U.S. individual life, group life and accidental death reinsurance business in 2000. This segment is predominantly comprised ofguaranteed minimum death benefit, guaranteed minimum income benefit,workers compensation and personal accident reinsurance products.
Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits The Company reinsured a guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies. These GMDB variable annuities are essentially investments in mutual funds combined with a death benefit.The Company has equity and other market exposures as a result of this product.
The determination of liabilities for GMDB requires the Company to make critical accounting estimates.The Company describes the assumptions used to develop the reserves for these death benefits, and provides the effects of hypothetical changes in those assumptions on page 43.See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these assumptions and the reserve balances.
53 Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits The Company also reinsured a guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.All reinsured GMIB policies also have a GMDB benefit that is reinsured.The Company has equity and other market exposures as a result of this product.
The determination of liabilities for GMIB requires the Company to make critical accounting estimates.The Company describes the assumptions used to develop the liabilities for these benefits and provides the effects of hypothetical changes in those assumptions on page 45.See Note 20(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these assumptions and the liability balances.
Workers Compensation and Personal Accident Reinsurance Products The Companys Run-off Reinsurance operations reinsured workers compensation and personal accident business in the London market and the United States.
The Company purchased retrocessional coverage in these markets to substantially reduce the risk of loss on these contracts.Disputes involving a number of these reinsurance and retrocessional contracts have been substantially resolved and some of the disputed contracts have been commuted.See Litigation and Other Legal Matters in Note 20(E) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The Company's payment obligations under these contracts are based on ceding companies claim payments relating to accidents and injuries.These claim payments can in some cases extend many years into the future, and the amount of the ceding companies ultimate claims, and therefore the amount ofthe Company's ultimate payment obligations and ultimate collection from retrocessionaires may not be known with certainty for some time.
Segment Summary The Companys reserves for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the Company, as well as for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires, are considered appropriate as of December 31, 2007, based on current information.However, it is possible that future developments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition.The Company bears the risk of loss if its payment obligations to cedents increase or if its retrocessionaires are unable to meet, or successfully challenge, their reinsurance obligations to the Company.
Results of Operations (In       millions) Financial       Summary 2007 2006 2005 Premiums       and fees $ 60 $ 64 $ 92 Net       investment income 93 95 99 Other       revenues (47 ) (97 ) (48 ) Segment       revenues 106 62 143 Benefits       and expenses 160 80 219 Loss       before income tax benefits (54 ) (18 ) (76 ) Income       tax benefits (43 ) (4 ) (12 ) Segment       loss $ (11 ) $ (14 ) $ (64 ) Realized       investment gains (losses), net       of taxes $ 2 $ 22 $ (2 ) Special       item (after-tax) included in segment       loss: Charge       related to guaranteed minimum       income benefit contracts $ (56 ) $ - $ - Excluding the special item noted in the table above, segment results in the Run-off Reinsurance segment in 2007 improved as compared to 2006. This was predominantly due to an increase in earnings from several settlements and commutations that were favorable to the Companys reserve position at the time, as well as higher earnings in the workers compensation and personal accident business, resulting from more favorable claim development.These factors were partially offset by losses of $35 million after-tax in the GMIB product due to higher annuitization experience and declines in interest rates.
The segment loss for Run-off Reinsurance was lower in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to more favorable results in the workers compensation and personal accident lines of business due to lower reserve increases related to retrocessional credit risk as well as more favorable claims experience. The GMDB and GMIB businesses also reported a more favorable result as compared to 2005 reflecting lower reserve increases related to GMDB and GMIB contracts.
Other Revenues The Company maintains a program to substantially reduce the equity market exposures relating to guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts by entering into exchange-traded futures contracts.Other revenues include pre-tax losses of $32 million in 2007, $96 million in 2006 and $48 million in 2005 from these contracts.Expense offsets reflecting corresponding changes in liabilities for these guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts were included in benefits and expenses.The notional amount of the futures contract positions held by the Company at December 31, 2007 related to this program was $625 million.
Benefits and Expenses Benefits and expenses increased significantly in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to an increase in liabilities of $86 million pre-tax for the guaranteed minimum income benefits business, related to the assumption changes for 54 annuitization and lapse experience (see Note 20(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and higher annuitization experience prior to the assumption change. In addition, improvements in equity markets for 2007 were smaller than in 2006, leading to higher benefits expense for the guaranteed minimum death benefit business. These factors were partially offset by lower expense in the workers compensation and personal accident businesses, due to the impact of favorable claim experience and settlements and commutations that were favorable to the Companys reserved position.
Benefits and expenses decreased 63% in 2006 compared to 2005 due to larger equity market improvements in 2006, leading to lower benefits expense for the guaranteed minimum death benefit business. In addition, in the workers compensation and personal accident businesses, reserve increases related to both retrocessional credit risk and claim experience were lower in 2006 than 2005.
Other Operations Segment Segment Description Other Operations consist of:  non-leveraged       and leveraged corporateowned life insurance   (COLI);  deferred       gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance and       annuity business and the 2004 sale of the retirement benefits business;       and  run-off       settlement annuity business.
The COLI portion of this business has contributed the majority of the earnings in 2007 and 2006 for Other Operations.Federal legislation enacted in 1996 affected certain policies sold by the COLI business by eliminating on a prospective basis the tax deduction for policy loan interest for most leveraged COLI products. There have been no sales of this particular product since 1997.As a result of an Internal Revenue Service initiative to settle tax disputes regarding leveraged products, some customers have surrendered their policies and management expects earnings associated with these products to continue to decline.Management does not expect this to have a significant impact on the future operating results of the segment.
From April 1, 2004 through March 31, 2006, the Company had a modified coinsurance arrangement relating to the single premium annuity business sold to the buyer.Under the arrangement, the Company retained the invested assets supporting the reinsured liabilities.These invested assets were held in a business trust established by the Company.Effective April 1, 2006, the buyer converted this modified coinsurance arrangement to an indemnity reinsurance structure and took ownership of the trust assets.
Results of Operations (In       millions) Financial       Summary 2007 2006 2005 Premiums       and fees $ 108 $ 113 $ 118 Net       investment income 437 467 609 Other       revenues 82 102 448 Segment       revenues 627 682 1,175 Benefits       and expenses 473 531 692 Income       before taxes 154 151 483 Income       taxes 45 45 144 Segment       earnings $ 109 $ 106 $ 339 Realized       investment gains (losses),       net of taxes $ (2 ) $ 13 $ (6 ) Special       items (after-tax) included in segment       earnings: Completion       of IRS examination $ 5 $ - $ 11 Accelerated       recognition of deferred gain       on sale of retirement benefits business $ - $ - $ 204 Charge       associated with modified coinsurance       arrangement $ - $ - $ (8 ) Excluding the special item noted above, segment earnings decreased for Other Operations in 2007, primarily reflecting expected lower deferred gain amortization associated with the sales of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses.This decrease was partially offset by higher COLI earnings primarily reflecting favorable mortality experience.
Excluding the special items noted in the table above, segment earnings for Other Operations decreased in 2006 primarily due to:  lower       earnings in the corporate-owned life insurance business resulting from       unfavorable expense items which was partially offset by favorable       mortality experience;  lower       deferred gain amortization in the individual life insurance and annuity       business; and  the       absence of favorable tax adjustments recorded in   2005.
Revenues Net Investment Income.
Net investment income decreased 6% in 2007 and 23% in 2006 primarily due to a reduction in assets resulting from the conversion of the single premium annuity business in the run-off retirement benefits business to indemnity reinsurance.
Other Revenues.
Other revenues decreased 20% in 2007 and 77% in 2006 primarily due to lower deferred gain amortization related to the sold retirement benefits business and individual life insurance and annuity business. The amount of the deferred gain amortization recorded was $47 million in 2007, $62 million in 2006 and $396 million in 2005.

Excluding the special items noted in the table above, the increase in segment loss in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily reflects the impact of less favorable tax adjustments.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Description Discontinued operations represent results associated with certain investments or businesses that have been sold or are held for sale.

INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS The industry is under continuing review by government agencies and regulators with respect to payment practices.On February 13, 2008, State of New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into the use of data provided by Ingenix  a system used to calculate payments for services provided by out-of-network providers.The Company has received a subpoena from the New York Attorney Generals office in connection with this investigation and intends to fully cooperate and respond appropriately.The Company is also a defendant in a putative class action brought on behalf of members asserting that due to the use of Ingenix data, the Company improperly underpaid claims.The Company denies the allegations and will vigorously defend itself in the case.
In addition to the above referenced development, there are certain other matters that present significant uncertainty, which could result in a material adverse impact on consolidated results of operations.See Note 20(D) Regulatory and Industry Developments and Note 20(E) Litigation and Other Legal Matters in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (In       millions) Financial       Summary 2007 2006 2005 Short-term       investments $ 21 $ 89 $ 439 Cash       and cash equivalents $ 1,970 $ 1,392 $ 1,709 Short-term       debt $ 3 $ 382 $ 100 Long-term       debt $ 1,790 $ 1,294 $ 1,338 Shareholders'       equity $ 4,748 $ 4,330 $ 5,360 Liquidity The Company normally meets its operating requirements by:  maintaining       appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term       investments;  using       cash flows from operating activities; and  matching       investment maturities to the estimated duration of the related insurance       and contractholder liabilities (see page62 for additional       information).
The Companys insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions (see Solvency Regulation on page 58) that limit the amount of dividends or other distributions 56 (such as loans or cash advances) these subsidiaries may provide to the parent company without prior approval of regulatory authorities.The Company does not expect these restrictions to limit the use of operating cash flows of the insurance and HMO subsidiaries for the Companys general corporate purposes.
See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Cash flows from operations for the years ended December31 were as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Operating       activities $ 1,342 $ 642 $ 718 Investing       activities $ 269 $ 1,548 $ 258 Financing       activities $ (1,041 ) $ (2,513 ) $ (1,785 ) Cash flows from operating activities consist of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums and fees, gains (losses) recognized in connection with the Company's program to manage equity market risk related to reinsured guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts, investment income, taxes, and benefits and expenses.
2007: Cash flows from operating activities increased by $700 million in 2007 from 2006 and were affected by the following significant items:  lower       net cash outflows of $212 million to originate commercial mortgage loans       held for sale (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for       additional information);  lower       net cash outflows of $64 million associated with futures contracts related       to the Run-off Reinsurance segment (see Note 7to the Consolidated       Financial Statementsfor additional   information);  net       cash outflows in 2006 of $171 million for experience-rated refunds due to       the loss of a large prescription drug contract;   and  settlement       in 2006 of certain liabilities associated with the single premium annuity       business of $44 million.
Excluding these items, cash flows from operating activities in 2007 increased by $209 million compared with 2006.The increase was primarily due to higher cash revenues of $1.2 billion resulting from business growth in all of the Companys ongoing operating segments, partially offset by higher paid claims of $536 million and higher operating expenses of $498 million (including higher tax payments of $138 million).
Cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of net sales of investments of $495 million, partially offset by net purchases of property and equipment of $180 million (including $118 million of Health Care capitalized software) and net cash used in acquisitions of $42 million.
Cash used in financing activities primarily reflectednetcash outflowsof $948 million consisting of dividends paid and repurchase of common stock totaling $1.2billion,partially offset by $248 million from issuance of common stock to employees under the Company's stock plans.In addition, there were net withdrawals of contractholder deposit funds of $193 million. Partially offsetting these out flows were net proceeds from long-term debt of $120 million, consisting of $498 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt partially offset by long-term debt repayment of $378 million.
2006: Cash flows from operating activities decreased by $76 million in 2006 from 2005 and were affected by the following significant items:  net       cash outflows in 2006 of $216 million to originate commercial mortgage       loans held for sale (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements       for additional information);  higher       net cash outflows in 2006 of $48 million associated with futures contracts       related to run-off reinsurance (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial       Statements for additional information);  settlement       in 2006 of certain liabilities associated with the single premium annuity       business of $44 million;  net       cash outflows in 2006 of $171 million for experience-rated refunds due to       the loss of a large prescription drug contract, compared with net receipts       of $107 million in 2005 from that contract;  2005       voluntary pension contributions of $440 million (see Note 9 to the       Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information);       and  2005       cash receipts from discontinued operations of $222   million.
Excluding these items, cash flows from operating activities was $292 million higher in 2006, primarily because the increase in cash revenues was $121 million greater than the increase in paid claims (excluding the claims of the large prescription drug contract in 2006) primarily due to membership and revenue growth in Health Care.In addition, operating expenses were $171 million lower in 2006, reflecting the absence of required pension contributions in 2006 (approximately $100 million in 2005).
Cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds from investments of $1.8 billion, partially offset by net purchases of property and equipment of $136 million, net cash transferred of $45 million in connection with the conversion of the single premium annuity business to indemnity reinsurance and net cash used in acquisitions of $38 million.
Cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of dividends on and repurchases of common stock of $2.8 billion, repayment of long-term debt of $100 million and net withdrawals of contractholder deposit funds of $124 57 million,       partially offset by net proceeds of $246 million on issuance of       long-term debt and proceeds of $251 million from issuances of common stock       to employees under the Company's stock plans.
Operating cash flows in all periods presented have been more than adequate to meet the Companys liquidity requirements.
Interest Expense Interest expense on long-term debt and capital leases was as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Interest       expense $ 122 $ 104 $ 105 Capital Resources The Companys capital resources (primarily retained earnings and the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities) provide protection for policyholders, furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth.
Management, guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines, determines the amount of capital resources that the Company maintains.Management allocates resources to new long-term business commitments when returns, considering the risks, look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate.
The Company has sufficient capital resources to:  provide       capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial       strength ratings of subsidiaries;  consider       acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous;       and  return       capital to investors through share repurchase.
Under a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in 2006, the Company is permitted to take advantage of its status as a well-known seasoned issuer and may issue debt, equity or other securities from time to time, with amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Companys debt issuances.
In addition, the Company has $500 million remaining under an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which may be issued as debt securities, equity securities or both.Management and the Board of Directors will consider market conditions and internal capital requirements when deciding whether the Company should issue new securities.
In June 2007, the Company amended and restated its five year revolving credit and letter of credit agreement for $1.75 billion, which permits up to $1.25 billion to be used for letters of credit. The credit agreement includes options, which are subject to consent by the administrative agent and the committing bank, to increase the commitment amount up to $2.0 billion and to extend the term of the agreement. The Company entered into the agreement for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper and to obtain statutory reserve credit for certain reinsurance arrangements. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility nor any letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2007.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook The availability of resources at the parent/holding company level is partially dependent on dividends from the Companys subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions and rating agency capital guidelines.The Company expects, based on current projections for cash activity (including projections for dividends from subsidiaries), to have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, including:  debt       service requirements and dividend payments tothe Company       shareholders; and  pension       plan funding requirements.
However, if the Company's projections are not realized, the demand for funds could exceed available cash if:  management       uses cash for investment opportunities;  a       substantial insurance or contractholder liability becomes due before       related investment assets mature;  a       substantial increase in funding is required forthe Company's       program to reduce the equity market risks associated with the guaranteed       minimum death benefit contracts; or  regulatory       restrictions prevent the insurance and HMO subsidiaries from distributing       cash to the parent company.
In those cases, the Company has the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through short-term borrowings, such as revolving credit and line of credit agreements of up to $1.75 billion.
In November 2007, the Company announced its plan to acquire Great West Healthcare.The acquisition will require $1.5 billion in cash.The Company is targeting an April 1, 2008 closing date and expects to finance the acquisition with $1.0 billion in parent company cash and $500 million in new debt issuances.As of December 31, 2007, cash at the parent company was approximately $885 million.
In addition, the Company intends to retain approximately $400 million of surplus in the subsidiaries during 2008 to support the transaction.
Solvency regulation.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) utilizes risk-based capital (RBC) standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparingeach 58 companys adjusted surplus to its required surplus (RBC ratio).The RBC ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies.Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC ratio decreases.There are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control.At December 31, 2007, the RBC ratio of each of the Companys primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action.The RBC framework described above for insurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs.Although not all states have adopted these rules at December 31, 2007, at that date, each of the Companys active HMOs had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the NAICs RBC rules.External rating agencies use their own RBC standards to evaluate capital adequacy as part of determining a companys rating.
The NAIC is considering changing statutory reserving rules for variable annuities.Any changes would apply to the Companys reinsurance contracts covering guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income benefits, and would impact the Companys overall surplus level.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company, through its subsidiaries, is contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business.The maturities of the Companys principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 31, 2007, are estimated to be as follows: (In       millions, on an undiscounted basis) Total Less       than 1 year 1-3       years 4-5 years After       5 years On-Balance       Sheet: Insurance       liabilities: Contractholder deposit       funds $ 4,660 $ 635 $ 518 $ 451 $ 3,056 Future       policy benefits 10,584 275 704 696 8,909 Health       Care medical       claims payable 975 973 2 - - Unpaid       claims and       claims expenses 4,890 1,376 901 650 1,963 Short-term       debt 3 3 - - - Long-term       debt 3,775 119 244 655 2,757 Non-recourse obligations 17 12 5 - - Other       long-term liabilities 665 335 198 48 84 Off-Balance       Sheet: Purchase obligations 1,422 489 557 297 79 Operating       leases 430 92 148 98 92 Total $ 27,421 $ 4,309 $ 3,277 $ 2,895 $ 16,940 On-Balance Sheet:  Insurance       liabilities.
Contractual cash obligations for insurance       liabilities, excluding unearned premiums and fees, represent estimated net       benefit payments for health, life and disability insurance policies and       annuity contracts.Actual obligations in any single year will       vary based on actual morbidity, mortality, lapse, withdrawal and premium       experience.The sum of the obligations presented above exceeds       the corresponding insurance liabilities of $15.0 billion recorded on the       balance sheet because these recorded liabilities reflect discounting for       interest.The Company manages its investment portfolios to       generate cash flows needed to satisfy contractual       obligations.Any shortfall from expected yields could result in       increases to recorded reserves and adversely impact results of       operations.The amounts associated with the sold retirement       benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses are excluded       from the table above as net cash flow associated with them are not       expected to impact the Company.The total amount of these       reinsured reserves excluded is approximately $6.8   billion.
Short-term       debt represents current obligations under capital       leases.
Long-term       debt includes scheduled interest payments.Capital       leases are included in long-term debt and represent obligations for       software licenses.
Non-recourse       obligations represent principal and interest payments due which may       be limited to the value of specified assets, such as real estate       properties held in joint ventures.
Other       long-term liabilities.
These items are presented in       accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company's       consolidated balance sheet.This table includes estimated       payments for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit       obligations, supplemental and deferred compensation plans, interest rate       and foreign currency swap contracts and certain tax and reinsurance       liabilities.Estimated payments of $90 million for deferred       compensation, non-qualified and International pension plans and other       postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in       less than one year.The Company does not expect to make, nor is       the Company required to make, contributions to its primary qualified       domestic pension plan in 2008.The Company expects to make       additional payments subsequent to 2008 for these obligations, however       subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is       based on plan assumptions which may materially differ from actual       activities (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for       further information on pension and other postretirement benefit       obligations). The Company expects to make additional payments subsequent       to 2008 for tax obligations, however, 59 subsequent       payments have been excluded from the table as their amount and timing is       uncertain given a review of tax years only recently   begun.
Off-Balance Sheet:  Purchase       obligations.
As of December 31, 2007, purchase       obligations consisted of estimated payments required under contractual       arrangements for future services and investment commitments as       follows: (In       millions) Fixed       maturities $ 15 Commercial       mortgage loans 83 Real       estate 10 Limited       liability entities (other long-term investments) 443 Total       investment commitments 551 Future       service commitments 871 Total       purchase obligations $ 1,422 The Company had commitments to purchase investments in limited liability entities that hold real estate or loans in real estate entities or securities.See Note 10(C) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Future service commitments include an agreement with IBM for various information technology (IT) infrastructure services.The Company's commitment under this contract is approximately $640 million over a 6-year period.The Company has the ability to terminate this agreement with 90 days notice, subject to termination fees.
The Company's remaining estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and IT maintenance and support.The Company generally has the ability to terminate these agreements, but does not anticipate doing so at this time.Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty or those that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
Operating       leases and certain Outsourced service arrangements.
For       additional information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial       Statements.
Guarantees The Company, through its subsidiaries, is contingently liable for various financial guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business.See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statementsfor additional information on guarantees.
Share Repurchase The Company maintains a share repurchase program, which was authorized by its Board of Directors.Decisions to repurchase shares depend on market conditions and alternative uses of capital.The Company has, and may continue from time to time, to repurchase shares on the open market through a Rule 10b5-1 plan which permits a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.
The Company repurchased 23.7 million shares in 2007 for $1.2 billion, and 75.9 million shares in 2006 for $2.8 billion.Shares repurchased have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-one stock split effective June 2007. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The total remaining share repurchase authorization as of February 26, 2008, was $327 million.
During 2007, the Company suspended its repurchase program due to the capital requirements to fund the pending Great-West acquisition.In 2008, following the closing of the Great-West acquisition, the Company expects to have the capacity to resume the share repurchase program or consider additional acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2008.
INVESTMENT ASSETS Additional information regardingthe Companys investment assets and related accounting policies is included in Notes 2, 10, 11 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2007 Form 10-K.
Fixed Maturities Investments in fixed maturities (bonds) include publicly traded and privately placed debt securities, mortgage and other asset-backed securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor.Fixed maturities, as presented on the balance sheet, also include trading and hybrid securities.
(In       millions) 2007 2006 Federal       government and agency $ 628 $ 597 State       and local government 2,489 2,488 Foreign       government 882 766 Corporate 7,419 7,364 Federal       agency mortgage-backed - 2 Other       mortgage-backed 221 223 Other       asset-backed 442 515 Total $ 12,081 $ 11,955 Other mortgage-backed assets consist principally of commercial mortgage-backed securities of which $7 million were residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, all of which were originated utilizing standard underwriting practices and are not considered sub-prime loans.
Quality ratings As of December31, 2007, $11.3 billion, or 93%, of the fixed maturities in the Companys investment portfolio were 60 investment grade (Baa and above, or equivalent), and the remaining $0.8 billion were below investment grade.Most of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum.
Private placement investments are generally less marketable than public bonds, but yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly offered debt with comparable credit risk.The fair value of private placement investments was $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2007, and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2006.The Company maintains controls on its participation in private placement investments.In particular, the Company performs a credit analysis of each issuer, diversifies investments by industry and issuer and requires financial and other covenants that allow the Company to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength so the Company can take remedial actions, if warranted.See Critical Accounting Estimates on page 42 for additional information.
Because of the higher yields and the inherent risk associated with privately placed investments and below investment grade securities, gains or losses from such investments could affect future results of operations.However, management does not expect such gains or losses to be material to the Companys liquidity or financial condition.
Commercial Mortgage Loans The Companys commercial mortgage loans are made exclusively to commercial borrowers; therefore there is no exposure to either prime or sub-prime residential mortgages.These fixed rate loans are diversified by property type, location and borrower to reduce exposure to potential losses.Loans are secured by the related property and are generally made at less than 75% of the propertys value.The Company routinely monitors and evaluates the status of its commercial mortgage loans by reviewing loan and property-related information, including cash flows, expiring leases, financial health of the borrower and major tenants, loan payment history, occupancy and room rates for hotels and market conditions.The Company evaluates this information in light of current economic conditions as well as geographic and property type considerations.
Problem and Potential Problem Investments Problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms (interest rate or maturity date).Potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are fully current, but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems.These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the following:  request       from the borrower for restructuring;  principal       or interest payments past due by more than 30 but fewer than 60       days;  downgrade       in credit rating;  deterioration       in debt service ratio;  collateral       losses on asset-backed securities; and  significant       vacancy in commercial rental mortgage property, or a decline in sales for       commercial retail mortgage property.
The Company recognizes interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment.The amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non-accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant in 2007, 2006 or 2005.
The following table shows problem and potential problem investments at amortized cost as of December31: (In       millions) Gross Reserve Net 2007 Problem       bonds $ 47 $ (30 ) $ 17 Potential       problem bonds $ 34 $ (9 ) $ 25 Potential       problem commercial mortgage       loans $ 70 $ - $ 70 Foreclosed       real estate $ 16 $ (3 ) $ 13 2006 Problem       bonds $ 71 $ (50 ) $ 21 Potential       problem bonds $ 15 $ (1 ) $ 14 Potential       problem commercial mortgage       loans $ 22 $ - $ 22 Foreclosed       real estate $ 16 $ (3 ) $ 13 Summary The effect of investment asset write-downs and changes in valuation reserves on the Companys net income are shown below. Other includes amounts attributable to future policy benefits for certain annuities and a modified coinsurance arrangement associated with the sold retirement benefits business prior to its conversion to indemnity reinsurance in April 2006.
(In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 CIGNA $ 26 $ 29 $ 14 Other $ - $ - $ 2 The Companys portion of these losses is a component of realized investment results.
Sustained weaknesses in certain sectors of the economy and the possibility of rising interest rates for an extended period may cause additional investment losses.These investment losses could materially affect future results of operations, although the Company does not currently expect them to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition.
MARKET RISK Financial Instruments The Companys assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse 61 changes in market rates and prices.The Companys primary market risk exposures are:  Interest-rate       risk on fixed-rate, domestic, medium-term       instruments.Changes in market interest rates affect the value       of instruments that promise a fixed return and impact the value of       liabilities for reinsured guaranteed minimum death and income benefit       contracts.
Foreign       currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar to the South Korean       won, Taiwan dollar, British pound, euro, Hong Kong dollarand       New Zealand dollar.An unfavorable change in exchange rates       reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign       currencies.
Equity       price risk for domestic equity securities and for reinsurance       contracts that guarantee minimum death or income benefits resulting from       unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values based on underlying       mutual fund investments.
See Notes 7 and 20(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts, respectively.
The Companys Management of Market Risks The Company predominantly relies on three techniques to manage its exposure to market risk:  Investment/liability       matching .
The Company       generally selects investment assets with characteristics (such as       duration, yield, currency and liquidity) that correspond to the underlying       characteristics of its related insurance and contractholder liabilities so       that the Company can match the investments to its       obligations.Shorter-term investments support generally       shorter-term life and health liabilities.Medium-term,       fixed-rate investments support interest-sensitive and health       liabilities.Longer-term investments generally support products       with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long-term disability       liabilities.
Use of       local currencies for foreign operations .
The Company       generally conducts its international business through foreign operating       entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local       currencies.This substantially limits exchange rate risk to net       assets denominated in foreign currencies.
Use of       derivatives.
The Company       generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market       risks and enhance investment returns.
See Notes 2(C) and 10(F) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments.
Effect of Market Fluctuations on the Company The examples that follow illustrate the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including:  hypothetical       changes in market rates for interest and foreign currencies primarily for       fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans;   and  hypothetical       changes in market prices for equity exposures primarily for equity       securities and contracts that guarantee minimum income       benefits.
In addition, hypothetical effects of changes in equity indices and foreign exchange rates are presented separately for futures contracts used in a program for guaranteed minimum death benefits.
Management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because:  these       examples were developed using estimates and   assumptions;  changes       in the fair values of all insurance-related assets and liabilities have       been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market       risk;  changes       in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of       accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and       postemployment benefit plans (and related assets) have been excluded,       consistent with the disclosure guidance; and  changes       in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as       goodwill, deferred acquisition costs, taxes, and various accrued       liabilities have been excluded; because they are not financial       instruments, their primary risks are other than market     risk.
The effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of the Companys financial instruments, subject to the exclusions noted above (particularly insurance liabilities), would have been as follows as of December 31: Market       scenario for certain       noninsurance financial       instruments Loss       in fair value 2007 2006 100       basis point increase in interest       rates $800       million $950       million 10%       strengthening in U.S.
dollar       to foreign currencies $150       million $160       million 10%       decrease in market prices for       equity exposures $60       million $30       million The effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates on the fair value of certain of the Companys financial instruments decreased in 2007 as a result of declining investments in commercial mortgage loans and shortening durations of fixed maturity investments supporting certain annuities and 62 increased long-term debt.The effect of a hypothetical decrease in market prices for equity exposures increased in 2007 as a result of increased net liabilities related to guaranteed minimum income benefits reinsured by the Company based on higher assumed annuity election rates.See Critical Accounting Estimates for guaranteed minimum income benefitbenefits on page45 for further discussion.
The effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models, primarily duration modeling.The effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by the Company was estimated to be 10% of the U.S. dollar equivalent fair value.The effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was estimated based on a 10% decrease in the mutual fund values underlying guaranteed minimum income benefits reinsured by the Company and a 10% decrease in the value of equity securities held by the Company.See Note 20(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The Company uses futures contracts as part of a program to substantially reduce the effect of equity market changes on certain reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum death benefits based on unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values.The hypothetical effect of a 10% increase in the S&P 500, S&P 400, Russell 2000, NASDAQ, TOPIX (Japanese), EUROSTOXX and FTSE (British) equity indices and a 10% weakening in the U.S. dollar to the Japanese yen, British pound and euro would have been a decrease of approximately $60 million in the fair value of the futures contracts outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2007.A corresponding decrease in liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts would result from the hypothetical 10% increase in these equity indices and 10% weakening in the U.S. dollar.See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this program and related guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts.
As noted above, the Company manages its exposure to market risk by matching investment characteristics to its obligations.
Stock Market Performance The performance of equity markets can have a significant effect on the Company's businesses, including on:  risks       and exposures associated with guaranteed minimum death benefit (see Note 7       to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and income benefit contracts       (see Note 20(B) to the Consolidated Financial Statements);     and  pension       liabilities since equity securities comprise a significant portion of the       assets of the Companys employee pension plans (see page     46).
63 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in press releases, in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors.Forward-looking statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and other uncertainties.These forward-looking statements are based on managements beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management at the time the statements are or were made.Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the information concerning possible or assumed future business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, trends and, in particular, the Companysproductivity initiatives, litigation and other legal matters, operational improvement in the health care operations, and the outlook for the Companysfull year 2008 results.Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, may, should or similar expressions.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.The Company cautions that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: 1.
increased       medical costs that are higher than anticipated in establishing premium       rates in the Companys health care operations, including increased use and       costs of medical services; 2.
increased       medical, administrative, technology or other costs resulting from new       legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on the Companys employee       benefits businesses; 3.
challenges       and risks associated with implementing operational improvement initiatives       and strategic actions in the health care operations, including those       related to: (i) offering products that meet emerging market needs, (ii)       strengthening underwriting and pricing effectiveness, (iii) strengthening       medical cost and medical membership results, (iv) delivering quality       member and provider service using effective technology solutions, and (v)       lowering administrative costs; 4.
risks       associated with pending and potential state and federal class action       lawsuits, disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements, other litigation       and regulatory actions challenging the Companys businesses and the       outcome of pending government proceedings and tax   audits; 5.

70 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1  Description of Business CIGNA constitutes one of the largest investor-owned health service organizations in the United States. Its subsidiaries are major providers of health care and related benefits, the majority of which are offered through the workplace, including health care products and services such as medical coverages, pharmacy, behavioral health, dental benefits, and disease management; group disability, life and accident insurance; and disability and workers compensation case management and related services.In addition, CIGNA has an international operation that offers life, accident and supplemental health insurance products and international health care products and services to businesses and individuals in selected markets. CIGNA also has certain inactive businesses, including a run-off reinsurance operation.
Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A.
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CIGNA, its significant subsidiaries, and variable interest entities of which CIGNA is the primary beneficiary, which are referred to collectively as the Company.Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
These consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).Amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements reflect managements estimates and assumptions about medical costs, investment valuation, interest rates and other factors.Significant estimates are discussed throughout these Notes; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
All weighted average shares, per share amounts and references to stock compensation for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-one stock split effective June 4, 2007 (see Note 4).Par value and treasury stock were not affected by the stock split and, as a result, the Company reclassified $48 million from additional paid-in capital to common stock to reflect the issuance of approximately 191 million additional shares at par value.
Beginning in 2007, the Company reports the results of the run-off retirement business in Other Operations.Prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation.
Certain insignificant reclassifications have been made to prior years' amounts to conform to the 2007 presentation.
Discontinued operations.
Summarized financial data for discontinued operations primarily represents:  impairment       losses related to the dispositions in 2007 and 2006 of several Latin       American insurance operationsas discussed in Note   3;  realized       gains on the disposition of certain directly-owned real estate       investmentsin 2007 and 2006 as discussed in Note 11;     and  tax       benefits recognized in connection with past divestitures as discussed in       Note 16.
(In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Income       before income (taxes)       benefits $ 25 $ 19 $ - Income       (taxes) benefits (7 ) (6 ) 349 Income       from operations 18 13 349 Impairment       loss, net of tax (23 ) (17 ) - Income       (loss) from discontinued operations,       net of taxes $ (5 ) $ (4 ) $ 349 Unless otherwise indicated, amounts in these Notes exclude the effects of discontinued operations .
Variable interest entities.
During 2007, certain real estate joint ventures and the remaining entity that issues investment products liquidated their primary assets and liabilities.As a result, as of December 31, 2007, the Company consolidated $5 million in assets and $5 million in liabilities as the primary beneficiary of one real estate joint venture and no longer consolidates any assets or liabilities related to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs).As of December 31, 2006, the Company consolidated $57 million in assets and $47 million in liabilities related to real estate joint ventures, and $55 million in assets and $26 million in liabilities related to CLOs.
B.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Uncertain tax positions.
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes." This interpretation provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions that are "more likely than not" to result in a benefit if challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).The guidance clarifies that the amount of tax benefit recognized should be measured using management's best estimate based on the most favorable expected benefit with greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized.The interpretation also requires that interest expense and penalties be recognized for any reserved portion of an uncertain tax position beginning when the effect of that position is reported to tax authorities.The cumulative effect of implementing the interpretation for unrecognized tax benefits decreased opening retained earnings by $29 million.See Note 16 for additional information.
Certain financial instruments.
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. This standard clarifies when certain financial instruments and features of financial instruments must be treated as derivatives and reported on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income. At 71 adoption, the Company elected to fair value certain existing investments in preferred stock and debt securities with call or conversion features (hybrid securities) and future changes in the fair value of these investments will be reported in net income. As a result, the Company reclassified $12 million after-tax of unrealized appreciation from the opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings with no net change to total shareholders' equity. In addition, this standard may affect future income recognition for certain future financial instruments if the fair value election is used or if additional derivatives are identified because any changes in their fair values will be recognized in net income each period. See Note 10(A) for a review of instruments that the Company has elected to fair value.
Deferred acquisition costs.
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company implemented the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, "Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts."The SOP requires that deferred acquisition costs be expensed in full when the original contract is substantially changed by election or amendment of an existing contract feature or by replacement with a new contract.There were no material effects to the consolidated financial statements at implementation.Although substantial contract changes are not expected to occur, the effect of this SOP in future periods may vary based on the nature and volume of any such contract changes.
Pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
Effective December 31, 2006, the Company implemented SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans." This standard requires that the overfunded or underfunded status of all defined benefit postretirement plans be measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation and recognized in the balance sheet.Changes in actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are required to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, each period.The effects on the consolidated financial statements were as follows: Before After Application       of Adjust- Application       of (In       millions) SFAS       No. 158 ments SFAS       No. 158 Liability       for pension benefits $ 744 $ 99 $ 843 Liability       for other postretirement       benefits $ 590 $ (155 ) $ 435 Total       liabilities $ 38,125 $ (56 ) $ 38,069 Deferred       income tax asset $ 946 $ (20 ) $ 926 Accumulated       other comprehensive       (loss) $ (205 ) $ 36 $ (169 ) Total       shareholders' equity $ 4,294 $ 36 $ 4,330 Liabilities for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Companys balance sheet.
The implementation of SFAS No. 158 did not impact the Company's pension expense, funding requirements or financial covenants.See Note 9 for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
Other-than-temporary impairment.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company implemented guidance provided by the FASB on evaluating fixed maturities and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment. Because this guidance is largely a summary of existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, there was no material effect in accounting for fixed maturities and equity securities with other-than-temporary impairments at implementation. See Note 10(A) for a review of declines in fair value of fixed maturities and equity securities.
Business combinations.
In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007, referred to as SFAS No. 141R,) Business Combinations, to require fair value measurements for all future acquisitions, including contingent purchase price and contingent assets or liabilities of the entity to be acquired.This standard also expands the definition of business combination to include all transactions or events in which an entity obtains control of a business, requires acquisition related and restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred and requires changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date to be reported in income tax expense.SFAS No. 141R is effective for all business combinations beginning in 2009.The effect of these new requirements on the Companys financial condition and results of operations will depend on the volume and terms of acquisitions in 2009 and beyond, but will likely increase the amount and change the timing of recognizing expenses related to acquisition activities.
Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.
In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51," to require that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be presented as part of equity of the consolidated group, separate from the parent shareholders' equity.In addition, net income and components of other comprehensive income of the subsidiary must be allocated between the controlling and noncontrolling interests and presented separately based on relative ownership interests or contractual arrangements.These new presentation requirements must be applied through retrospective restatement of prior financial statements beginning in 2009.The Company is presently evaluating the impact of these new requirements, but does not expect material changes to the results of operations or financial condition.
Fair value option.
In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which permits entities to choose fair value measurement of many financial instruments with subsequent 72 changes in fair value to be reported in net income for the period. This choice is made for each individual financial instrument, is irrevocable and, after implementation, must be determined when the entity first commits to or recognizes the financial instrument.Implementation is required in the first quarter of 2008 with any changes in the measurement of existing financial instruments to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.The Company does not currently expect to elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities at implementation. For financial assets and liabilities acquired subsequently, the Company will determine whether to use the fair value election at the time of acquisition.
Fair value measurements.
In 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," to expand disclosures about fair value measurements and to clarify how to measure fair value by focusing on the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price).Except for certain nonfinancial instruments, implementation is required in the first quarter of 2008 with any changes to the fair values of assets or liabilities to be reported generally in net income.For fixed maturities and equity securities held for sale and derivatives that hedge future cash flows, changes in fair value will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the period. The FASB voted to defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 until first quarter 2009 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities (such as intangible assets, property and equipment and goodwill) that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis (such as at acquisition or impairment).
Estimates of the fair values of the assets and liabilities for reinsurance contracts covering guaranteed minimum income benefits under certain variable annuity contracts issued by other insurance companies, including related retrocessional coverage from two external reinsurers, will be impacted by these new requirements.The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these contracts will be determined using a market-based view of an exit price rather than using historical market data and actual experience to establish the Companys future expectations.These assumptions include market returns and volatilities of the underlying equity and bond mutual fund investments, interest rates, mortality, lapse and annuity election rates, retrocessional credit, and risk and profit charges. For many of these assumptions, there is limited or no observable market data so determining an exit price under SFAS No. 157 requires significant judgment. The impact to the Companys net income of implementing SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008 is expected to be a non-cash loss of $125-$150 million after-tax, net of estimated reinsurance recoverable, in the Run-off Reinsurance segment.In addition, the Companys results of operations related to this business are expected to be more volatile in future periods as changes in the underlying assumptions will be based on current market inputs each period rather than on longer term expectations.
C.
Financial Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions involving various types of financial instruments.These financial instruments may include:  various       investments (such as fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and       equity securities);  short-       and long-term debt; and  off-balance-sheet       instruments (such as investment and certain loan commitments and financial       guarantees).
These instruments may change in value due to interest rate and market fluctuations, and most also have credit risk.The Company evaluates and monitors each financial instrument individually and, when management considers it appropriate, uses a derivative instrument or obtains collateral or another form of security to minimize risk of loss.
Most financial instruments that are subject to fair value disclosure requirements are carried in the consolidated financial statements at amounts that approximate fair value.The following table shows the fair values and carrying values of the Companys financial instruments not carried at fair value that are subject to fair value disclosure requirements, at the end of 2007 and 2006: (In       millions) 2007 2006 Fair Carrying Fair Carrying Value Value Value Value Commercial       mortgage loans $ 3,315 $ 3,277 $ 4,060 $ 3,988 Contractholder       deposit funds,       excluding universal life       products $ 931 $ 936 $ 1,324 $ 1,332 Long-term       debt excluding       capital leases $ 1,790 $ 1,777 $ 1,390 $ 1,277 Fair values of off-balance-sheet financial instruments were not material.
Fair values of financial instruments are based on quoted market prices when available.When market prices are not available, management generally estimates fair value based on discounted cash flow analyses, which use current interest rates for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality.Management estimates the fair value of the liabilities for contractholder deposit funds using the amount payable on demand.In certain cases, the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could be realized if the instrument were sold immediately.
73 D.
Investments The Company's accounting policies for investment assets are discussed below: Fixed maturities and equity securities.
Fixed maturities include bonds, mortgage- and other asset-backed securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor.Equity securities include common stocks and preferred stocks that are non-redeemable or redeemable only by the issuer.These investments are primarily classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity.Fixed maturities and equity securities are considered impaired, and their cost basis is written down to fair value through earnings, when management expects a decline in value to persist (i.e. the decline is other than temporary).Fixed maturities and equity securities include certain trading and hybrid securities carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other revenues for trading securities and in realized investment gains and losses for hybrid securities, beginning after the implementation of SFAS No. 155 on January 1, 2007.
Commercial mortgage loans.
Mortgage loans held by the Company are made exclusively to commercial borrowers, therefore there is no exposure to either prime or sub-prime residential mortgages.Generally, commercial mortgage loans are carried at unpaid principal balances and are issued at a fixed rate of interest.Commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of unpaid principal balance or market with any resulting valuation allowance reported in realized investment gains and losses.Commercial mortgage loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will not collect amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement.Impaired loans are carried at the lower of unpaid principal or fair value of the underlying collateral.The Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral using internal valuations generally based on discounted cash flow analyses.
Policy loans.
Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances.
Real estate.
Investment real estate can be held and used or held for sale.The Company accounts for real estate as follows:  real       estate "held and used" is expected to be held longer than one year and       includes real estate acquired through the foreclosure of commercial       mortgage loans.The Company carries real estate held and used       at depreciated cost less any write-downs to fair value due to impairment       and assesses impairment when cash flows indicate that the carrying value       may not be recoverable.Depreciation is generally calculated       using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the       particular real estate asset.
real       estate is "held for sale" when a buyers investigation is completed, a       deposit has been received and the sale is expected to be completed within       the next year.Real estate held for sale is carried at the       lower of carrying value or current fair value, less estimated costs to       sell, and is not depreciated.Valuation reserves reflect any       changes in fair value.
the       Company uses several methods to determine the fair value of real estate,       but relies primarily on discounted cash flow analyses and, in some cases,       third party appraisals.
At the time of foreclosure, properties are reclassified from commercial mortgage loans to real estate.The Company rehabilitates, re-leases and sells foreclosed properties.This process usually takes from 2 to 4 years unless management considers a near-term sale preferable.
Other long-term investments.
Other long-term investments include investments in unconsolidated entities.These entities include certain limited partnerships and limited liability companies holding real estate, securities or loans.These investments are carried at cost plus the Companys ownership percentage of reported income or loss in cases where the Company has significant influence, otherwise the investment is carried at cost.Also included in other long-term investments are loans to unconsolidated real estate entities secured by the equity interests of these real estate entities, which are carried at unpaid principal balances (mezzanine loans).
Short-term investments.
Investments with maturities of less than one year from time of purchase are classified as short-term, available for sale and carried at fair value, which approximates cost.
Derivative financial instruments.
Note 10(F) discusses the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.
Net investment income.
When interest and principal payments on investments are current, the Company recognizes interest income when it is earned.The Company stops recognizing interest income when interest payments are delinquent or when certain terms (interest rate or maturity date) of the investment have been restructured.Net investment income on these investments is only recognized when interest payments are actually received.
Investment gains and losses.
Realized investment gains and losses result from sales, investment asset write-downs, changes in the fair values of hybrid securities and certain derivatives and changes in valuation reserves based on specifically identified assets.Realized investment gains and losses on the disposition of certain directly owned real estate investments are eliminated from ongoing operations and reported in discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the underlying assets are clearly distinguishable and the Company has no significant continuing involvement in the operations.
74 Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities and equity securities carried at fair value (excluding trading and hybrid securities) and certain derivatives are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of:  amounts       required to adjust future policy benefits; and  deferred       income taxes.
E.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments that will mature in three months or less from the time of purchase.The Company reclassifies immaterial cash overdraft positions to accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities when the legal right of offset does not exist.
F.
Reinsurance Recoverables Reinsurance recoverables are estimates of amounts that the Company will receive from reinsurers and are recorded net of amounts management believes will not be received.
G.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs include sales compensation, commissions, premium taxes and other costs that the Company incurs in connection with new and renewal business.Depending on the product line they relate to, the Company records acquisition costs in different ways.Acquisition costs for:  Universal       life products are deferred and amortized in proportion to the       present value of total estimated gross profits over the expected lives of       the contracts.
Annuity and       other individual life insurance (primarily international) and group health       indemnity products are deferred and amortized, generally in       proportion to the ratio of periodic revenue to the estimated total       revenues over the contract periods.
Other       products are expensed as incurred.
For universal life, annuity and other individual products, management estimates the present value of future revenues less expected payments.For group health indemnity products, management estimates the sum of future expected claims and related costs less unearned premiums and anticipated net investment income.If managements estimates are less than the deferred costs, the Company reduces deferred policy acquisition costs and records an expense.Anticipated investment income is considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for short-duration contracts.The Company recorded in other operating expenses amortization for policy acquisition costs of $242 million in 2007, $202 million in 2006 and $149 million in 2005.There are no deferred policy acquisition costs attributable to the run-off retirement or run-off reinsurance operations.
H.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.When applicable, cost includes interest, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during construction.Also included in this category is internal-use software that is acquired, developed or modified solely to meet the Companys internal needs, with no plan to market externally.Costs directly related to acquiring, developing or modifying internal-use software are capitalized. Unamortized internal-use software costs were $304 million at December 31, 2007, and $270 million at December 31, 2006. Amortization expense for internal use software was $111 million in 2007, $97 million in 2006 and $85 million in 2005.Most of the unamortized internal-use software costs relate to the Companys health care business initiatives to enhance systems and processes designed to support business growth and service to customers.
The Company incurred total costs of approximately $1.1 billion for a multi-year project that began in 1999 and was substantially completed in 2005, of which $453 million has been capitalized and $660 millionhas been expensed as incurred.Amortization, which commenced in phases as members migrated to the new systems, is over a 7.5 year period.Accumulated amortization for this project was $327 million at December 31, 2007 and $239 million at December 31, 2006.
For other capitalized costs, the Company calculates depreciation and amortization principally using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset.
Accumulated depreciation and amortization on property and equipment was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006.
I.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of their net assets.The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually based on discounted cash flow analyses and writes it down through earnings if impaired.Substantially all goodwill relates to the Health Care segment.
J.
Other Assets, including Other Intangibles Other assets consist primarily of various insurance-related assets.The Companys other intangible assets include purchased customer relationships, provider networks, and trademarks.The Company amortizes other intangibles on a straight-line basis over periods from 1 to 11 years.Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value.Other assets also include the gain position of certain derivatives (see Note 10(F)).
75 The gross carrying value of the Companys other intangible assets was $275 million at December 31, 2007 and $266 million at December 31, 2006.The accumulated amortization was $211 million at December 31, 2007 and $202 million at December 31, 2006.
K.
Separate Account Assets and Liabilities Separate account assets and liabilities are contractholder funds maintained in accounts with specific investment objectives. The assets of these accounts are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any of the Companys other businesses.These separate account assets are carried at fair value with equal amounts for related separate account liabilities.The investment income, gains and losses of these accounts generally accrue to the contractholders and are not included in the Companys revenues and expenses. Fees earned for asset management services are reported in premiums and fees.
L.
Contractholder Deposit Funds Liabilities for contractholder deposit funds include deposits received from customers for investment-related and universal life products and investment earnings on their fund balances.These liabilities are adjusted to reflect administrative charges and, for universal life fund balances, mortality charges.
M.
Future Policy Benefits Future policy benefits are liabilities for the present value of estimated future obligations under long-term life and supplemental health insurance policies and annuity products currently in force.These obligations are estimated using actuarial methods and primarily consist of reserves for annuity contracts, life insurance benefits, guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts and certain life, accident and health insurance products in our International operations.
Obligations for annuities represent specified periodic benefits to be paid to an individual or groups of individuals over their remaining lives.Obligations for life insurance policies represent benefits to be paid to policyholders, net of future premiums to be received.Management estimates these obligations based on assumptions as to premiums, interest rates, mortality and surrenders, allowing for adverse deviation.Mortality, morbidity, and surrender assumptions are based on either the Companys own experience or actuarial tables.Interest rate assumptions are based on managements judgment considering the Companys experience and future expectations, and range from 1.25% to 10.0%.Obligations for certain annuities include adjustments for amounts that would be required had related investments been sold at their current fair values.
Certain reinsurance contracts guarantee a minimum death benefit under variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.These obligations represent the guaranteed death benefit in excess of the contractholders account values (based on underlying equity and bond mutual fund investments).These obligations are estimated based on assumptionsregarding lapse, partial surrenders, mortality, interest rates (mean investment performance and discount rate), market volatility as well as investment returns and premiums, consistent with the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles when a premium deficiency exists.Lapse, partial surrenders, mortality, interest rates and volatility are based on managements judgment considering the Companys experience and future expectations.The results of futures and forward contracts are reflected in the liability calculation as a component of investment returns.See also Note 7 for additional information.
N.
Unpaid Claims and Claims Expenses Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses are estimates of payments to be made under insurance coverages, (primarily long-term disability, workers compensation and life and health), for reported claims and for losses incurred but not yet reported.
The Company develops these estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported using actuarial principles and assumptions based on historical and projected claim incidence patterns, claim size and the length of time over which payments are expected to be made.The Company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each reporting period, with consideration given to the variability of these factors, and recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence, as required by actuarial standards of practice, which require that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions.
The Company's estimate of the liability for disability claims reported but not yet paid is primarily calculated as the present value of expected benefit payments to be made over the estimated time period that a policyholder remains disabled.The Company estimates the expected time period that a policyholder may be disabled by analyzing the rate at which an open claim is expected to close (claim resolution rate).Claim resolution rates may vary based upon the length of time a policyholder is disabled, the covered benefit period, cause of disability, benefit design and the policyholder's age, gender and income level.The Company uses historical resolution rates combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of resolution rates.
Because benefit payments may be made over an extended time period, the Company discounts certain claim liabilities related to group long-term disability and workers compensation.Discount rate assumptions are based on projected investment returns for the asset portfolios that support these liabilities and range from 3.5% to 6.5%.When estimates change, the Company records the adjustment in benefits and expenses in the period in which the change in estimate is identified. At December 31, discounted liabilities associated with the long-term disability and certain workers compensation businesses were $3.1 billion in 2007 and 2006.
76 O.
Health Care Medical Claims Payable Medical claims payable for the Health Care segment include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported.
The Company develops these estimates using actuarial principles and assumptions based on historical and projected claim payment patterns, medical cost trends, which are impacted by the utilization of medical services and the related costs of the services provided (unit costs), benefit design, seasonality, and other relevant operational factors.The Company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each reporting period, with consideration given to the variability of these factors, and recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence, as required by actuarial standards of practice, which require that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions.
The Company's estimate of the liability for medical claims incurred but not yet reported is primarily calculated using historical claim payment patterns and expected medical cost trends.The Company analyzes the historical claim payment patterns by comparing the dates claims were incurred, generally the dates services were provided, to the dates claims were paid to determine completion factors, which are a measure of the time to process claims.A completion factor is calculated for each month of incurred claims.The Company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors.The Company estimates the ultimate liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of completion factors to the current paid claim data.The difference between this estimate of the ultimate liability and the current paid claim data is the estimate of the remaining claims to be paid for each incurral month.These monthly estimates are aggregated and included in the Company's Health Care medical claims payable at the end of each reporting period.Completion factors are used to estimate the health care medical claims payable for all months where claims have not been completely resolved and paid, except for the most recent month as described below.
Completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in the level of claims processed electronically versus manually (auto-adjudication), changes in provider claims submission rates, membership changes and the mix of products.As noted, the Company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors.This approach implicitly assumes that historical completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current period.It is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns, which could have a material impact on the Company's medical claims payable and net income.
Claims incurred in the most recent month have limited paid claim data, since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to the Company for payment in the month services have been provided.This makes the completion factor approach less reliable for claims incurred in the most recent month.As a result, in any reporting period, for the estimate s of the ultimate claims incurred in the most recent month, the Company primarily relies on medical cost trend analysis, which reflects expected claim payment patterns and other relevant operational considerations.Medical cost trend is impacted by several key factors including medical service utilization and unit costs andthe Companys ability to manage these factors through benefit design, underwriting, provider contracting andthe Company's medical management initiatives.These factors are affected by changes in the level and mix of medical benefits offered, including inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy, the impact of copays and deductibles, changes in provider practices and changes in consumer demographics and consumption behavior.
Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experienced for the most recent history along with an analysis of emerging trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the liability for Health Care medical claims payable at December 31, 2007 and 2006.It is possible that the actual medical trend for the current period will develop differently from that expected, which could have a material impact on the Company's medical claims payable and net income.
For each reporting period, the Company evaluates key assumptions by comparing the assumptions used in establishing the medical claims payable to actual experience. When actual experience differs from the assumptions used in establishing the liability, medical claims payable are increased or decreased through current period net income.Additionally, the Company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends which may impact key assumptions.The estimation process involves considerable judgment, reflecting the variability inherent in forecasting future claim payments.The adequacy of these estimates is highly sensitive to changes in the Company's key assumptions, specifically completion factors, which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the submission and payment of medical claims, and medical cost trends, which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the utilization of medical services and unit costs.
P.
Unearned Premiums and Fees Premiums for life, accident and health insurance are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract period.Fees for mortality and contract administration of universal life products are recognized ratably over the coverage period.
The unrecognized portion of these amounts is recorded as unearned premiums and fees.
77 Q.
Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities consist principally of pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits and various insurance-related liabilities, including amounts related to reinsurance contracts and insurance-related assessments that management can reasonably estimate.Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities also include certain overdraft positions and the loss position of certain derivatives (see Note 10(F)).Legal costs to defend the Companys litigation and arbitration matters are expensed when incurred.
R.
Translation of Foreign Currencies The Company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies, which are generally their functional currencies.The Company uses exchange rates as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars.Translation gains or losses on functional currencies, net of applicable taxes, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).The Company uses average exchange rates during the year to translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars.
S.
Premiums and Fees, Revenues and Related Expenses Premiums for life, accident and health insurance and managed care coverages are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the contract period.Benefits and expenses are recognized when incurred.
Premiums for individual life insurance and individual and group annuity products, excluding universal life and investment-related products, are recognized as revenue when due.Benefits and expenses are matched with premiums.
Revenue for investment-related products is recognized as follows:  net       investment income on assets supporting investment-related products is       recognized as earned.
contract       fees, which are based upon related administrative expenses, are recognized       in premiums and fees as they are earned ratably over the contract       period.
Benefits and expenses for investment-related products consist primarily of income credited to policyholders in accordance with contract provisions.
Revenue for universal life products is recognized as follows:  net       investment income on assets supporting universal life products is       recognized as earned.
fees       for mortality are recognized as assessed, which is as     earned.
administration       fees are recognized as services are provided.
surrender       charges are recognized as assessed, which is as   earned.
Benefits and expenses for universal life products consist of benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances.Expenses are recognized when claims are submitted, and income is credited in accordance with contract provisions.
Contract fees and expenses for administrative services only programs and pharmacy programs and services are recognized as services are provided.Mail order pharmacy revenues and cost of goods sold are recognized as each prescription is shipped.
T.
Stock Compensation The Company records compensation expense for stock awards and options over their vesting periods based on the estimated fair value of the stock options, which is calculated using an option-pricing model.Compensation expense is recorded for restricted stock grants and deferred stock units over their vesting periods based on fair value, which is equal to the market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant.
U.
Participating Business The Companys participating life insurance policies entitle policyholders to earn dividends that represent a portion of the earnings of the Companys life insurance subsidiaries.Participating insurance accounted for approximately 2% of the Companys total life insurance in force at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005.
V.
Income Taxes The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated United States federal income tax return.The Companys foreign subsidiaries file tax returns in accordance with applicable foreign law.U.S. taxation of foreign affiliates may differ in timing and amount from taxation under foreign laws.Reportable amounts, including credits for foreign tax paid by those affiliates, are reflected in the U.S. tax return of the affiliates domestic parent.
The Company generally recognizes deferred income taxes when assets and liabilities have different values for consolidated financial statement and tax reporting purposes.Note 16 contains detailed information about the Companys income taxes.
78 Note 3  Acquisitions and Dispositions The Company may from time to time acquire or dispose of assets, subsidiaries or lines of business.Significant transactions are described below.
A.
Star HRG Acquisition During 2006, the Company acquired the operating assets of Star HRG, a leading provider of low cost health plans and other employee benefits coverage for hourly and part-time workers and their families, for $156 million, including assumed liabilities.The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and was financed through the issuance of a note payable to the seller (see Note 12). The purchase price was allocated as follows: $57 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remaining $99 million to goodwill.
Intangible assets (primarily purchased customer relationships, software and trademarks)associated with the acquisition are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods from 3 to 10 years.
The results of Star HRG are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.
B.
Sale of the Chilean Insurance Operations On August 10, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Chilean insurance operations, which was classified as a discontinued operation in 2007.The Company recognized an impairment loss in 2007 for this business of $19 million after-tax primarily relating to the write-off of unrecoverable tax assets and foreign currency translation losses.The assets and liabilities of the Chilean insurance operations, which were held for sale, were reported in other assets and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.Amounts as of December 31, 2006 have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.
C.
Pending Sale of the Brazilian Life Insurance Operations During 2006, the Company entered into negotiations to sell its Brazilian life insurance business and classified this business as a discontinued operation.The Company recognized a n impairment loss in 2006 with respect to this business of $17 million after-tax, primarily related to the write-off of unrecoverable foreign tax credits and foreign currency translation losses.The sale, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in 2008.
D.
Sale of Retirement Benefits Business In 2004, the Company sold its retirement benefits business, excluding the corporate life insurance business, for cash proceeds of $2.1 billion. The sale resulted in an initial after-tax gain of $809 million, of which $267 million after-tax was recognized immediately and the remaining amount was deferred. The Company recognized deferred gain amortization in other revenues in the Run-off Retirement segment as follows: (In       millions) Pre-Tax After-Tax 2007 Accelerated       deferred gain amortization $ 2 $ 1 Normal       deferred gain amortization $ 7 $ 4 2006 Accelerated       deferred gain amortization $ 8 $ 7 Normal       deferred gain amortization $ 10 $ 7 2005 Accelerated       deferred gain amortization $ 322 $ 204 Normal       deferred gain amortization $ 24 $ 16 As of December 31, 2007, the remaining deferred gain of $36 million after-tax will be recognized in the Companys results of operations through 2032.
E.
Sale of Individual Life Insurance and Annuity Business In 1998, the Company sold its individual life insurance and annuity business for cash proceeds of $1.4 billion.The sale generated an after-tax gain of approximately $800million, the majority of which was deferred and is recognized at the rate that earnings from the sold business would have been expected to emerge (primarily over 15 years on a declining basis).The Company recognized deferred gains of $25 million after-tax in 2007, $28 million after-tax in 2006 and $32 million after-tax in 2005.The remaining deferred gain as of December 31, 2007, was $130 million after-tax.
Note 4  Earnings Per Share On April 25, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved a three-for-one stock split (in the form of a stock dividend) of the Company's common shares.The stock split was effective on June 4, 2007 for shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 21, 2007.All weighted average shares, per share amounts and references to stock compensation data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split.
79 Basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for income from continuing operations are computed as follows for the years ended December 31: (In       millions, Effect       of except       per share amounts) Basic Dilution Diluted 2007 Income       from continuing operations $ 1,120 $ - $ 1,120 Shares       ( in       thousands): Weighted       average 283,191 - 283,191 Options       and restricted stock       grants 5,141 5,141 Total       shares 283,191 5,141 288,332 EPS $ 3.95 $ (0.07 ) $ 3.88 2006 Income       from continuing operations $ 1,159 $ - $ 1,159 Shares       ( in       thousands): Weighted       average 331,257 - 331,257 Options       and restricted stock       grants 5,728 5,728 Total       shares 331,257 5,728 336,985 EPS $ 3.50 $ (0.06 ) $ 3.44 2005 Income       from continuing operations $ 1,276 $ - $ 1,276 Shares       ( in       thousands): Weighted       average 382,044 - 382,044 Options       and restricted stock       grants 7,375 7,375 Total       shares 382,044 7,375 389,419 EPS $ 3.34 $ (0.06 ) $ 3.28 The following outstanding employee stock options as of December 31, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have increased diluted earnings per share (antidilutive) as their exercise price was greater than the average share price of the Company's common shares for the period.

Incurred but not yet reported comprises the majority of the reserve balance at December 31 as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 Incurred       but not yet reported $ 786 $ 820 Reported       claims in process 145 95 Other       medical expense payable 44 45 Medical       claims payable $ 975 $ 960 Activity in medical claims payable was as follows for the years ended December 31: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Balance       at January 1, $ 960 $ 1,165 $ 1,594 Less:Reinsurance       and other amounts recoverable 250 342 497 Balance       at January 1, net 710 823 1,097 Incurred       claims related to: Current       year 6,878 6,284 6,631 Prior       years (80 ) (173 ) (326 ) Total       incurred 6,798 6,111 6,305 Paid       claims related to: Current       year 6,197 5,615 5,844 Prior       years 594 609 735 Total       paid 6,791 6,224 6,579 Balance       at December 31, net 717 710 823 Add:Reinsurance       and other amounts recoverable 258 250 342 Balance       at December 31, $ 975 $ 960 $ 1,165 Reinsurance and other amounts recoverable reflect amounts due from policyholders to cover incurred but not reported and pended claims for minimum premium products and certain administrative services only business where the right of offset does not exist.
For the year ended December 31, 2007, actual experience differed from the Company's key assumptions, resulting in favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable of $80 million, or 1.3% of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended December 31, 2006. Actual completion factors resulted in a reduction in medical claims payable of $46 million, or 0.7% of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended December 31, 2006 for the insured book of business. Actual medical cost trend resulted in a reduction in medical claims payable of $34 million, or 0.6% of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended December 31, 2006 for the insured book of business. The favorable impact in 2007 relating to completion factors and medical cost trend variances is primarily due to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, which is a component of the assumptions for both completion factors and medical cost trend, established for claims incurred related to 2006.This release was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred related to 2007.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, actual experience differed from the Company's key assumptions, resulting in favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable of $173 million, or 2.6% of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended December 31, 2005.The favorable impact in 2006 is due to better than expected completion factors and faster time to process claims as well as lower than expected medical cost trends, all of which included an assumption for moderately adverse experience.
80 For the year ended December 31, 2006, actual completion factors resulted in a reduction of the medical claims payable of $99 million or 1.5% of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended December 31, 2005 for the insured book of business. Completion factors in 2006 reflected better than expected time to process claims, driven by higher auto-adjudication rates, the impact of claim recoveries and more timely submissions of provider claims.For the year ended December 31, 2006, actual medical cost trend resulted in a reduction of the medical claims payable of $74 million or 1.1% of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended December 31, 2005 for the insured book of business.The better than expected medical cost trend in 2006 was driven by lower inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy service utilization and lower than expected unit cost trends.The lower than expected unit cost trends reflected provider contracting initiatives and the mix of services provided.
The corresponding impact of favorable prior year development on net income was $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, or 0.1% in 2007 and 0.8% in 2006 of the current year incurred claims as reported for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.The change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in the Company's net income recognized for the following reasons: First, due to the nature of the Company's retrospectively experience-rated business, only adjustments to medical claims payable on accounts in deficit affect net income.An increase or decrease to medical claims payable on accounts in deficit, in effect, accrue to the Company and directly impact net income.An account is in deficit when the accumulated medical costs and administrative charges, including profit charges, exceed the accumulated premium received.Adjustments to medical claims payable on accounts in surplus accrue directly to the policyholder with no impact on the Company's net income.An account is in surplus when the accumulated premium received exceeds the accumulated medical costs and administrative charges, including profit charges.
Second, the Company consistently recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence, as required by actuarial standards of practice, which require that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions.As the Company establishes the liability for each incurral year, the Company ensures that its assumptions appropriately consider moderately adverse conditions. When a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase deemed appropriate to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims, the Company does not consider that offset amount as having any impact on net income.
Note 6 Initiatives to Lower Operating Expenses The Company has undertaken several initiatives to realign its organization and consolidate support functions in an effort to increase efficiency and responsiveness to customers.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company completed a review of staffing levels in the health care operations and in supporting areas.As a result, the Company recognized in other operating expenses a charge for severance costs of $37 million pre-tax ($23 million after-tax). The Company substantially completed this program in 2007.
In 2005, the Company implemented a plan to further streamline operations in the health care business and in supporting areas.As a result, the Company recognized in other operating expenses a total charge for severance costs of $51 million pre-tax ($33 million after-tax).The Company substantially completed this program in 2006.
Note 7  Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit Contracts The Companys reinsurance operations, which were discontinued in 2000 and are now an inactive business in run-off mode, reinsured a guaranteed minimum death benefit under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.These variable annuities are essentially investments in mutual funds combined with a death benefit.The Company has equity and other market exposures as a result of this product.
The majority of the Company's exposure arises under annuities that guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than the highest historical account value of the related mutual fund investments on a contractholders anniversary date.Under this type of death benefit,the Company is liable to the extent the highest historical anniversary account value exceeds the fair value of the related mutual fund investments at the time of a contractholders death.Other annuity designs that the Company reinsured guarantee that the benefit received at death will be:  the       contractholders account value as of the last anniversary date       (anniversary reset); or  no       less than net deposits paid into the contract accumulated at a specified       rate or net deposits paid into the contract.
In periods of declining equity markets and in periods of flat equity markets following a decline, the Company's liabilities for these guaranteed minimum death benefits increase.Conversely, in periods of rising equity markets, the Company's liabilities for these guaranteed minimum death benefits decrease.As a result of the implementation of the program to reduce equity market exposures discussed below, the favorable and unfavorable effects of the equity market on the reserve are largely offset in other revenues as a result of the related futures contracts gains or losses.
81 Activity in future policy benefit reserves for these guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts was as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Balance       at January 1 $ 862 $ 951 $ 988 Less:Reinsurance       recoverable at 1/1 17 24 30 Add:Incurred       benefits 61 15 105 Less:Paid       benefits 74 97 136 Add:Reinsurance       recoverable at 12/31 16 17 24 Balance       at December 31 $ 848 $ 862 $ 951 Benefits paid and incurred are net of ceded amounts.Incurred benefits reflect the favorable or unfavorable impact of a rising or falling equity market on the liability.As discussed below, losses or gains have been recorded in other revenues as a result of the program to reduce equity market exposures.
Management estimates reserves for variable annuity death benefit exposures based on assumptions regarding lapse, partial surrender, mortality, interest rates (mean investment performance and discount rate) and volatility.These assumptions are based on the Companys experience and future expectations over the long-term period.The Company monitors actual experience to update these reserve estimates as necessary.
Lapse refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to a contractholders death.Partial surrender refers to the fact that most contractholders have the ability to withdraw substantially all of their mutual fund investments while retaining the death benefit coverage in effect at the time of the withdrawal.Mean investment performance and market volatility refer to the market return and market fluctuations respectively, that affect the costs of the program adopted by the Company to reduce equity market risks associated with these liabilities.
The Company regularly evaluates the assumptions used in establishing reserves and changes its estimates if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.If actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating these reserves, the resulting differences could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition.
The following provides information about the Companys reserving methodology and assumptions for guaranteed minimum death benefits as of December 31, 2007:  The       reserves represent estimates of the present value of net amounts expected       to be paid, less the present value of net future       premiums.Included in net amounts expected to be paid is the       excess of the guaranteed death benefits over the values of the       contractholders accounts (based on underlying equity and bond mutual fund       investments).
The       reserves include an estimate for partial surrenders that essentially lock       in the death benefit for a particular policy based on annual election       rates that vary from 0-33% depending on the net amount at risk for each       policy and whether surrender charges apply.
The       gross mean investment performance assumption is 5% considering the       Company's program to reduce equity market exposures using futures       contracts (described below).This is reduced by fund fees       ranging from 1-3% across all funds.
The       volatility assumption is 15-30%, varying by equity fund type; 3-8%,       varying by bond fund type; and 2% for money market   funds.
The       discount rate is 5.75%.
The       mortality assumption is 70-75% of the 1994 Group Annuity Mortality table,       with 1% annual improvement beginning January 1,   2000.
The       lapse rate assumption is 0-15%, depending on contract type, policy       duration and the ratio of the net amount at risk to account       value.
The table below presents the account value, net amount at risk and average attained age of underlying contractholders for guarantees in the event of death, by type of benefit as of December 31.The net amount at risk is the death benefit coverage in force or the amount that the Company would have to pay if all contractholders had died as of the specified date, and represents the excess of the guaranteed benefit amount over the fair value of the underlying mutual fund investments.

The Company expects to adjust the contract positions and may enter into other contract positions over time, to reflect changing equity market levels and changes in the investment mix of the underlying variable annuity investments.
The Company recorded in other revenues pre-tax losses of $32 million in 2007, $96 million in 2006, and $48 million in 2005 from the futures contracts.Expense offsets reflecting 82 corresponding changes in liabilities for these guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts were included in benefits and expenses.The notional amount of the futures contract positions held by the Company at December 31, 2007 was $625 million.
The Company has also written reinsurance contracts with issuers of variable annuity contracts that provide annuitants with certain guarantees related to minimum income benefits.See Note 20(B) for further information.
Note 8  Reinsurance In addition to the exposures for guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts discussed above and for guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts discussed in Note 20(B), the Companys insurance subsidiaries enter into agreements with other insurance companies to assume and cede reinsurance.Reinsurance is ceded primarily to limit losses from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses.Reinsurance does not relieve the originating insurer of liability.The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentrations of credit risk.
A.
Retirement Benefits Business The Company had a reinsurance recoverable of $2.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2006 from Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company resulting from the sale of the retirement benefits business, which was primarily in the form of a reinsurance arrangement.The reinsurance recoverable is secured primarily by fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans held in a business trust established by the reinsurer.This recoverable is reduced as the Company's reinsured liabilities are paid or directly assumed by the reinsurer.
B.
Individual Life and Annuity Reinsurance The Company had a reinsurance recoverable of $4.7 billion at December 31, 2007, and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2006, from The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company resulting from the 1998 sale of the Companys individual life insurance and annuity business through an indemnity reinsurance arrangement.The reinsurance recoverable is secured primarily by fixed maturities held in a business trust established by the reinsurer in 2007.
C.
Workers Compensation and Personal Accident Reinsurance The Company's Run-off Reinsurance operations reinsured workers compensation and personal accident business in the London markets and the United States.
The Company purchased retrocessional coverage in these markets to substantially reduce the risk of loss on these contracts.Disputes involving a number of these reinsurance and retrocessional contracts have been substantially resolved and some of the disputed contracts have been commuted.See Note 20(E) Litigation and Other Legal Matters for more information.
The Company's payment obligations for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the Company under these contracts are based on ceding companies claim payments relating to accidents and injuries.These claim payments can in some cases extend many years into the future, and the amount of the ceding companies ultimate claims, and therefore the amount ofthe Company's ultimate payment obligations and ultimate collection from retrocessionaires may not be known with certainty for some time.
The Companys reserves for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the Company, as well as for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires, are considered appropriate as of December 31, 2007, based on current information.However, it is possible that future developments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition.The Company bears the risk of loss if its payment obligations to cedents increase or if its retrocessionaires are unable to meet, or successfully challenge, their reinsurance obligations to the Company.
D.
Other Reinsurance The Company could have losses if reinsurers fail to indemnify the Company on other reinsurance arrangements, either because of reinsurer insolvencies or contract disputes.However, management does not expect charges for other unrecoverable reinsurance to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
E.
Effects of Reinsurance In the Companys consolidated income statements, premiums and fees were net of ceded premiums, and benefits and expenses were net of reinsurance recoveries, in the following amounts: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Premiums       and Fees Short-duration       contracts: Direct $ 13,669 $ 12,333 $ 12,483 Assumed 331 443 398 Ceded (179 ) (181 ) (158 ) 13,821 12,595 12,723 Long-duration       contracts: Direct 1,401 1,262 1,211 Assumed 68 74 75 Ceded: Individual       life insurance and       annuity business sold (230 ) (256 ) (270 ) Other (52 ) (34 ) (44 ) 1,187 1,046 972 Total $ 15,008 $ 13,641 $ 13,695 Reinsurance       recoveries Individual       life insurance and annuity       business sold $ 323 $ 343 $ 332 Other 106 181 141 Total $ 429 $ 524 $ 473 83 The effects of reinsurance on written premiums and fees for short-duration contracts were not materially different from the recognized premium and fee amounts shown in the above table.
Note 9  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans A.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company and certain of its subsidiaries provide pension, health care and life insurance defined benefits to eligible retired employees, spouses and other eligible dependents through various plans.
The Company measures the assets and obligations of its domestic pension and other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31.The following table summarizes the projected obligations and assets related to the Company's domestic and international pension and other postretirement benefit plans as of, and for the years ended, December 31: Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits (In       millions) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Change       in benefit obligation Benefit       obligation, January       1 $ 4,186 $ 4,175 $ 465 $ 492 Service       cost 73 71 2 2 Interest       cost 231 223 24 26 Gain       from past experience (99 ) (7 ) (31 ) (15 ) Benefits       paid from plan assets (251 ) (249 ) (3 ) (4 ) Benefits       paid - other (36 ) (27 ) (31 ) (36 ) Amendments (59 ) - - - Benefit       obligation, December       31 4,045 4,186 426 465 Change       in plan assets Fair       value of plan assets, January       1 3,343 3,109 30 33 Actual       return on plan assets 321 481 1 1 Benefits       paid (251 ) (249 ) (3 ) (4 ) Contributions 4 2 - - Fair       value of plan assets, December       31 3,417 3,343 28 30 Funded       Status $ (628 ) $ (843 ) $ (398 ) $ (435 ) The postretirement benefits liability adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following as of December 31: Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits (In       millions) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Unrecognized       net gain (loss) $ (437 ) $ (767 ) $ 74 $ 49 Unrecognized       prior service cost 61 3 89 106 Postretirement       benefits liability       adjustment $ (376 ) $ (764 ) $ 163 $ 155 During 2007, the Companys postretirement benefits liability adjustment decreased by $396 million pre-tax ($258 million after-tax) resulting in an increase to shareholders equity.The decrease in the liability was primarily due to:  an       increase in the interest rate used to discount pension and other       postretirement benefit liabilities;  actual       asset returns that exceeded expected returns;  amortization       of actuarial losses;  adoption       of a pension plan amendment, which, as of April 1, 2008, will change the       benefit formula for employees hired prior to 1989 to one similar to all       other employees; and  the       annual update of census data, favorable medical claim experience, and       lower actual than expected election rates in the Companys postretirement       medical plan.
These favorable effects were partially offset by certain assumption changes primarily related to expected retirement ages.
Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.The overall effect was an after-tax increase to shareholders equity of $36 million.This increase occurred because prior service cost and net gains from past experience for other postretirement benefits plans more than offset the unrecognized underfunded pension liability.See Note 2(B) for further information.
In addition, prior to implementing SFAS No. 158, accumulated other comprehensive income increased in 2006 by $284 million after-tax, primarily due to lower minimum pension liabilities from the effect of asset returns in excess of expectations, amortization of losses from past experience, and an increase in the long-term interest rates used to determine the benefit obligation.
Pension benefits.
The Companys pension plans were underfunded by $628 million in 2007 and $843 million in 2006 and had related accumulated benefit obligations of $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2007 and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2006.
The Company funds its qualified pension plans at least at the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
The Company did not make domestic pension plan contributions in 2007 or 2006 to its primary qualified domestic pension plan and does not expect to make, nor is the Company required to make, domestic pension plan contributions in 2008.
The Company contributed $544 million in 2005 for minimum funding requirements for the domestic pension plan and for voluntary contributions to the domestic and international pension plans.
84 Actual cash contributions made to the pension plans could vary significantly from the estimates of unfunded plan obligations based on actual future returns on pension assets and future interest rates, both of which are highly unpredictable.The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires companies to fully fund defined benefit pension plans over a seven-year period beginning in 2008.The Company has evaluated this requirement in light of the underfunded status of its primary qualified domestic pension plan and has made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future.Based on this assessment and current facts, the Company does not believe that the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act will cause a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity in the future.
Components of net pension cost, for the years ended December 31 were as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Service       cost $ 73 $ 71 $ 72 Interest       cost 231 223 221 Expected       return on plan assets (209 ) (208 ) (181 ) Amortization       of: Net       loss from past experience 119 152 141 Prior       service cost (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Net       pension cost $ 213 $ 237 $ 252 The Company expects to recognize in 2008 $57 million of pre-tax loss from amortization of past experience and $9 million of pre-tax gain from amortization of prior service cost.
Other postretirement benefits.
Unfunded retiree health benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations of $283million at December31, 2007, and $315million at December 31, 2006.Retiree life insurance plans had accumulated benefit obligations of $143million as of December 31, 2007 and $150 million as of December 31, 2006.
Components of net other postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December31 were as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Service       cost $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 Interest       cost 24 26 27 Expected       return on plan assets (1 ) (2 ) (2 ) Amortization       of: Net       gain from past experience (6 ) (2 ) (2 ) Prior       service cost (17 ) (17 ) (17 ) Net       other postretirement benefit cost $ 2 $ 7 $ 8 The Company expects to recognize in 2008 $17 million of pre-tax gain related to amortization of prior service cost and $6 million of pre-tax gain from amortization of past experience.
The estimated rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care benefits beginning in 2008 through 2012 is 7%, decreasing to 6% in 2013 and 5% thereafter.This estimate reflects the Companys current claim experience and managements estimate that rates of growth will decline in the future.A 1% increase or decrease in the estimated rate would change 2007 reported amounts as follows: (In       millions) Increase Decrease Effect       on total service and interest cost $ 1 $ 1 Effect       on postretirement benefit obligation $ 12 $ 11 Plan assets.
The following summarizes the fair value of assets related to pension plans as of December 31: Percent       of Target Total       Fair Allocation Plan       Asset Category Value Percentage 2007 2006 2007 Equity       securities 64% 70% 63% Fixed       income 20% 19% 20% Real       estate 8% 5% 7% Other 8% 6% 10% The target investment allocation percentages are developed by management as guidelines, although the fair values of each asset category are expected to vary as a result of changes in market conditions.The pension plan asset portfolio has been most heavily weighted towards equity securities, consisting of domestic and international investments, in an effort to synchronize the expected higher rate of return on equities over the long-term with the overall long-term nature of the pension benefit obligations.The diversification of the pension plan assets into other investments is intended to mitigate the volatility in returns, while also providing adequate liquidity to fund benefit distributions.
A portion of the pension plan assets are invested in the separate accounts of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CGLIC) and Life Insurance Company of North America, which are subsidiaries of the Company.Most of these separate accounts are reinsured and managed by the buyer of the retirement benefits business.
The assets related to other postretirement benefit plans are invested in fixed income investments in the general account of CGLIC.
85 Assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
Management determined the present value of the projected pension benefit obligation and the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and related benefit costs based on the following weighted average assumptions as of and for the years ended December31: 2007 2006 Discount       rate: Pension       benefit obligation 6.25% 5.75% Other       postretirement benefit obligation 6.25% 5.75% Pension       benefit cost 5.75% 5.50% Other       postretirement benefit cost 5.75% 5.50% Expected       return on plan assets: Projected       pension benefit obligation 8.00% 7.50% Pension       benefit cost 7.50% 7.50% Accumulated       other postretirement benefit obligation 5.00% 5.00% Other       postretirement benefit cost 5.00% 5.00% Expected       rate of compensation increase: Projected       pension benefit obligation 3.50% 3.50% Pension       benefit cost 3.50% 3.50% Accumulated       other postretirement benefit obligation 3.00% 3.00% Other       postretirement benefit cost 3.00% 3.00% The discount rates were developed considering actual annualized yields as of the measurement date for high quality, long-term corporate bonds adjusted to reflect the durations of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed considering actual historical returns, current and expected market conditions, plan asset mix and managements investment strategy.
To measure pension costs, the Company uses a market-related asset valuation for domestic pension plan assets invested in non-fixed income investments.The market-related value of pension assets recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over 5 years, a method that reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations.
The average remaining service period of active employees associated with the Company's pension plan is approximately 6 years.The average remaining service period of active employees associated with the other postretirement benefit plans is approximately 9 years.
Changes tothe Company's assumptions for the discount rates and expected rate of return on domestic qualified plan assets will not change required cash contributions to the pension plan asthe Company funds at least the minimum amount required by ERISA.
Benefit payments.
The following benefit payments, including expected future services, are expected to be paid in: OtherPostretirement Benefits Pension Net       of Medicare (In       millions) Benefits Gross Part       D Subsidy 2008 $ 304 $ 45 $ 41 2009 $ 302 $ 43 $ 41 2010 $ 301 $ 43 $ 41 2011 $ 297 $ 43 $ 40 2012 $ 303 $ 42 $ 40 2013-2017 $ 1,474 $ 190 $ 181 B.
401(k) Plans The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan in which the Company matches a portion of employees pre-tax contributions.Another 401(k) plan with an employer match was frozen in 1999.Participants in the active plan may invest in a fund that invests in the Companys common stock, several diversified stock funds, a bond fund and a fixed-income fund.
The Company may elect to increase its matching contributions if the Companys annual performance meets certain targets.A substantial amount of the Companys matching contributions are invested in the Company common stock.The Companys expense for these plans was $35 million for 2007, $42million for 2006 and $36million for 2005.
Note 10  Investments A.
Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities Securities in the following table are included in fixed maturities and equities on the Companys balance sheet.These securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other revenues for trading securities and in realized investment gains (losses) for hybrid securities, beginning after the implementation of SFAS No. 155 on January 1, 2007.
(In       millions) 2007 2006 Included       in fixed maturities: Trading       securities (amortized       cost: $22;$26) $ 22 $ 27 Hybrid       securities (amortized cost:       $11;$10) 11 10 Total $ 33 $ 37 Included       in equity securities: Hybrid       securities (cost: $114;$102) $ 110 $ 105 Fixed maturities and equity securities included $89 million at December 31, 2007 and $88 million at December 31, 2006, which were pledged as collateral to brokers as required under certain futures contracts.These fixed maturities and equities securities were primarily corporate securities.
The following information about fixed maturities excludes trading and hybrid securities.The amortized cost and fair value by contractual maturity periods for fixed maturities were as follows at December31, 2007: Amortized Fair (In       millions) Cost Value Due       in one year or less $ 617 $ 626 Due       after one year through five years 2,858 2,927 Due       after five years through ten years 4,281 4,386 Due       after ten years 2,977 3,450 Mortgage-       and other asset-backed securities 643 659 Total $ 11,376 $ 12,048 86 Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without penalties.Also, in some cases the Company may extend maturity dates.
Other mortgage-backed assets consist principally of commercial mortgage-backed securities of which $7 million were residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, all of which were originated utilizing standard underwriting practices and are not considered sub-prime loans.
Gross unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on fixed maturities (excluding trading securities and hybrid securities beginning after the implementation of SFAS No. 155 on January 1, 2007) by type of issuer is shown below.

As of December31, 2007, the Company had commitments to purchase $15million of fixed maturities bearing interest at a fixed market rate.The Company expects to disburse all the committed amounts in 2008.
Review of declines in fair value .
Management reviews fixed maturities and equity securities for impairment based on criteria that include:  length       of time and severity of decline;  financial       health and specific near term prospects of the   issuer;  changes       in the regulatory, economic or general market environment of the issuers       industry or geographic region; and  ability       and intent to hold until recovery.
As of December 31, 2007, fixed maturities (excluding trading and hybrid securities) which were primarily investment grade corporate bonds with a decline in fair value from cost were as follows, including the length of time of such decline: Fair Amortized Unrealized Number (In       millions) Value Cost Depreciation of       Issues Fixed       Maturities: One       year or less: Investment       grade $ 1,977 $ 2,054 $ (77 ) 382 Below       investment grade $ 246 $ 255 $ (9 ) 150 More       than one year: Investment       grade $ 954 $ 992 $ (38 ) 361 Below       investment grade $ 22 $ 23 $ (1 ) 12 The unrealized depreciation of investment grade fixed maturities is primarily due to increases in interest rates since purchase.There were no equity securities with a material decline in fair value from cost as of December 31, 2007.See Note 11(B) for discussion of impairments included in realized investment gains and losses.
B.
Commercial Mortgage Loans and Real Estate Mortgage loans held by the Company are made exclusively to commercial borrowers; therefore there is no exposure to either prime or sub-prime residential mortgages.The Companys commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments are diversified by property type, location and, for commercial mortgage loans, borrower.Generally, commercial mortgage loans are carried at unpaid principal balances and are issued at a fixed rate of interest.
In connection with the Companys investment strategy to enhance investment yields by selling senior participations, commercial mortgage loans include loans that were originated with the intent to sell of $77 million as of December 31, 2007 and $124 million as of December 31, 2006.
87 At December31, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments were distributed among the following property types and geographic regions: (In       millions) 2007 2006 Property       type Office       buildings $ 1,048 $ 1,305 Apartment       buildings 1,008 891 Industrial 470 609 Retail       facilities 398 654 Hotels 336 537 Other 66 109 Total $ 3,326 $ 4,105 Geographic       region Pacific $ 1,117 $ 993 South       Atlantic 616 953 New       England 539 665 Central 476 659 Mountain 327 396 Middle       Atlantic 251 439 Total $ 3,326 $ 4,105 At December31, 2007, scheduled commercial mortgage loan maturities were as follows (in millions):$124 in 2008, $256 in 2009, $270 in 2010, $375 in 2011 and $2,252 thereafter.
Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities for several reasons: borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations, with or without prepayment penalties; the maturity date may be extended; and loans may be refinanced.
As of December31, 2007, the Company had commitments to extend credit under commercial mortgage loan agreements of $83 million, all of which were at a fixed rate of interest.These loan commitments are diversified by property type and geographic region.As of December 31, 2007, the Company had commitments to contribute additional equity of $10 million to real estate investments.The Company expects to disburse most of the committed amounts in 2009.
C.
Other Long-term Investments As of December 31, other long-term investments consisted of the following: (In       millions) 2007 2006 Real       estate entities $ 313 $ 244 Securities       partnerships 171 133 Mezzanine       loans and other 36 41 Total $ 520 $ 418 As of December 31, 2007, the Company had commitments to contribute:  $219       million tolimited liability entities that hold either real estate or       loans to real estate entities that are diversified by property type and       geographic region; and  $224       million to entities that hold securities diversified by issuer and       maturity date.
The Company expects to disburse approximately 40% of the committed amounts in 2008 and the remaining amounts by 2012.
D.
Short-Term Investments and Cash Equivalents Short-term investments and cash equivalents included corporate securities of $1.5 billion, federal government securities of $192 million and money market funds of $66 million at December 31, 2007.
The Companys short-term i nvestments and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006, included corporate securities of $973 million, money market funds of $101 million and federal government securities of $117 million.
E.
Concentration of Risk As of December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have a concentration of investments in a single issuer or borrower exceeding 10% of shareholders equity.
F.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Companys investment strategy is to manage the characteristics of investment assets (such as duration, yield, currency and liquidity) to meet the varying demands of the related insurance and contractholder liabilities (such as paying claims, investment returns and withdrawals).As part of this investment strategy, the Company typically uses derivatives to minimize interest rate, foreign currency and equity price risks.The Company routinely monitors exposure to credit risk associated with derivatives and diversifies the portfolio among approved dealers of high credit quality to minimize credit risk.In addition, the Company has written or sold contracts to guarantee minimum income benefits and to enhance investment returns.
The Company uses hedge accounting when derivatives are designated, qualify and are highly effective as hedges.Effectiveness is formally assessed and documented at inception and each period throughout the life of a hedge using various quantitative methods appropriate for each hedge, including regression analysis and dollar offset.Under hedge accounting, the changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged risk are generally recognized together and offset each other when reported in net income.
88 The Company accounts for derivative instruments as follows:  Derivatives       are reported on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair       values reported in net income or accumulated other comprehensive       income.
Changes       in the fair value of derivatives that hedge market risk related to future       cash flows  and that qualify for hedge accounting  are reported in a       separate caption in accumulated other comprehensive       income.These hedges are referred to as cash flow       hedges.
A       change in the fair value of a derivative instrument may not always equal       the change in the fair value of the hedged item; this difference is       referred to as hedge ineffectiveness.Where hedge accounting is       used, the Company reflects hedge ineffectiveness in net income (generally       as part of realized investment gains and   losses).
Features       of certain investments and obligations, called embedded derivatives, are       accounted for as derivatives.As permitted under SFAS No. 133,       derivative accounting has not been applied to these features of such       investments or obligations existing before January 1,   1999.
The Company recorded pre-tax realized investment losses of $11 million in 2006 from terminating swaps hedging interest rate and foreign currency risk of fixed maturities.The Company recorded pre-tax realized investment gains from swaps on commercial loan pools of $7 million in 2006 and 2005.
See Note 7 for a discussion of derivatives associated with guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts and Note 20(B) for a discussion of derivatives associated with guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts.The other effects of derivatives were not material to the Companys consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for 2007, 2006 or 2005.
89 The table below presents information about the nature and accounting treatment of the Companys primary derivative financial instruments.Derivatives in the Companys separate accounts are not included because associated gains and losses generally accrue directly to policyholders.
Instrument Risk Purpose Cash       Flows Accounting       Policy Futures Primarily       equityand foreign currency risks To       reduce domestic and international equity market exposures for certain       reinsurance contracts that guarantee death benefits resulting from changes       in variable annuity account values based on underlying mutual       funds.Currency futures are primarily euros, Japanese yen and       British pounds.
For       futures, the Company receives (pays) cash daily in the amount of the       change in fair value of the futures contracts.
Fair       value changes are reported in other revenues and cash flows are included       in operating activities.
Futures Interest       rate risk To       hedge fair value changes of fixed maturity and commercial mortgage loan       investments to be purchased.
The       Company receives (pays) cash daily in the amount of the change in fair       value of the futures contracts.
Using       cash flow hedge accounting, fair value changes are reported in accumulated       other comprehensive income and amortized into net investment income over       the life of the investments purchased.Cash flows are included       in operating activities.
Swaps Interest       rate and foreign currency risk To       hedge the interest or foreign currency cash flows of fixed maturities and       commercial mortgage loans to match associated liabilities. Currency swaps       are primarily Canadian dollars, euros, Australian dollars and Japanese yen       for periods of up to 14 years.
The       Company periodically       exchanges cash flows between variable and fixed interest rates or between       two currencies for both principal and interest.
Using       cash flow hedge accounting, fair values are reported in other long-term       investments or other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive       income. Net interest cash flows are reported in net investment income and       included in operating activities.
Credit       and interest rate risk To       enhance investment returns, the Company sells Dow Jones indexed credit       default swaps on a basket of primarily investment grade corporate       bonds.
The       Company receives quarterly fees and will make future payments if an issuer       of an underlying corporate bond defaults on scheduled payments or files       for bankruptcy. If an issuer defaults or files for bankruptcy, the Company       will make payment for the par value of the underlying corporate bond and       may subsequently sell or hold that bond as an invested       asset.If the most current indexed swaps are determined       desirable for liquidity, credit risk or other reasons, the Company also       pays or receives cash to settle purchases and sales.
Fair       values of the swaps are reported in other long-term investments or other       liabilities, with changes reported in realized investment gains and       losses.Quarterly fees and gains and losses on purchases and       sales are also reported in realized investment gains and       losses.These cash flows are reported in investing       activities.
Treasury       lock Interest       rate risk To       hedge the variability of and fix at inception date, the benchmark Treasury       rate component of future interest payments on debt to be issued in       2008.
The       Company will receive (pay) the fair value of the contract at the earliest       of expiration or debt issuance.
Using       cash flow hedge accounting, fair values are reported in short-term       investment or other liabilities, with changes to fair value reported in       accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized to interest expense       over the life of the debt issued.These cash flows will be       reported in operating activities.
Swaps       on commercial loan pools Interest       rate and credit risk To       obtain returns based on the performance of underlying commercial loan       pools.
The       Company receives cash based on the performance of underlying commercial       loan pools.
Fair       values of the swaps are reported in other long-term investments or other       liabilities, with changes reported in realized investment gains and       losses.These cash flows are reported in investing       activities.
Written       and Purchased Options Primarily       equity risk and interest rate risk The       Company has written certain reinsurance contracts to guarantee minimum       income benefits resulting from the level of variable annuity account       values compared with a contractually guaranteed amount.The       actual payment by the Company depends on the actual account value in the       underlying mutual funds and the level of interest rates when account       holders elect to receive minimum income payments.The Company       purchased reinsurance contracts to hedge the market risks       assumed.These contracts are accounted for as written and       purchased options.
The       Company periodically receives (pays) fees based on account       values.The Company will also pay (receive) cash depending on       changes in account values and interest rates when account holders first       elect to receive minimum income payments.
Fair       values are reported in other liabilities and other       assets.Changes in fair value are reported in other operating       expenses.These cash flows are reported in operating       activities.
Purchased       Options Interest       rate risk To       hedge the possibility of early policyholder cash surrender when the       amortized cost of underlying invested assets is greater than their fair       values.
The       Company pays a fee and may receive or pay cash, based on the difference       between the amortized cost and fair values of underlying invested assets       at the time of policyholder surrender.
Using       cash flow hedge accounting, fair values are reported in other assets or       other liabilities, with changes in fair value reported in accumulated       other comprehensive income and amortized to benefits expense over the life       of the underlying invested assets.These cash flows will be       reported in financing activities.

Also, in connection with the Star HRG acquisition in 2006, the Company issued to the seller a note payable of $151 million.Of that amount, $73 million was repaid during 2006 and the remaining $78 million is due in 2021.
Maturities of debt and capital leases are as follows (inmillions): $3 in 2008, $3 in 2009, $3 in 2010, $452 in 2011, $3 million in 2012 and the remainder in years after 2012.Interest expense on long-term debt and capital leases was $122 million in 2007, $104 million in 2006, and $105million in 2005.
The Company may issue commercial paper primarily to manage imbalances between operating cash flow and existing commitments, to meet working capital needs, and to take advantage of current investment opportunities.Commercial paper borrowing arrangements are supported by various lines of credit.There was no commercial paper outstanding as of December31, 2007 and 2006.
In June 2007, the Company amended and restated its five year revolving credit and letter of credit agreement for $1.75 billion, which permits up to $1.25 billion to be used for letters of credit.The credit agreement includes options, which are subject to consent by the administrative agent and the committing bank, to increase the commitment amount up to $2.0 billion and to extend the term of the agreement.The Company entered into the agreement for general corporate purposes, including support for the issuance of commercial paper and to obtain statutory reserve credit for certain reinsurance arrangements.There were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility nor any letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2007.

Note 16  Income Taxes As discussed in Note 2(B), the Company implemented FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007.As a result, total unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 were $245 million, including $108 million that would impact net income if recognized.At December 31, 2007, total unrecognized tax benefits increased to $260 million, including $124 million that would impact net income if recognized.
A reconciliation of the beginning to ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: (In       millions) Balance       at January 1, 2007 $ 245 Decrease       due to prior year positions (31 ) Increase       due to current year positions 51 Reduction       related to lapse of applicable statute of       limitations (5 ) Balance       at December 31, 2007 $ 260 During 2007, the IRS completed its examination of the Companys 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns.There remain two unresolved issues which will proceed to the appeals level.The timing for resolution of these matters remains uncertain due to the nature of the appeals process.The Company, however, anticipates that the appeals process could be completed in the next 12 months, but does not expect this to result in a significant change to the level of unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.
The Company classifies net interest expense on uncertain tax positions and any applicable penalties as a component of income tax expense in Corporate, but excludes these amounts from the disclosed FIN 48 liability.At January 1, 2007, the Company had $11 million of accrued interest and accrued an additional $6 million through 2007, which was net of an $8 million benefit associated with the completion of an IRS examination.
93 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December31 are shown below.
(In       millions) 2007 2006 Deferred       tax assets Employee       and retiree benefit plans $ 546 668 Investments,       net 26 48 Other       insurance and contractholder liabilities 267 258 Deferred       gain on sale of business 89 102 Policy       acquisition expenses 170 125 Loss       carryforwards 125 110 Other       accrued liabilities 88 91 Bad       debt expense 21 84 Other 40 43 Deferred       tax assets before valuation allowance 1,372 1,529 Valuation       allowance for deferred tax assets (150 ) (174 ) Deferred       tax assets, net of valuation allowance 1,222 1,355 Deferred       tax liabilities Depreciation       and amortization 202 202 Unrepatriated       foreign income, net 116 97 Unrealized       appreciation on investments and       foreign currency translation 110 130 Total       deferred tax liabilities 428 429 Net       deferred income tax assets $ 794 $ 926 Management believes that consolidated taxable income expected to be generated in the future will be sufficient to realize the Companys net deferred tax assets of $794 million as of December 31, 2007 and $926 million as of December31, 2006.This determination is based on the Companys earnings history and future expectations.
The Companys deferred tax asset is net of a federal and state valuation allowance (see table above).The valuation allowance reflects managements assessment as to whether certain deferred tax assets will be realizable.These assessments could be revised in the near term if underlying circumstances change.The $24 million decrease in the valuation allowance during 2007 relates primarily to the run-off reinsurance operations, and was attributable to the recognition of pretax operating income.The valuation allowance at December 31, 2007 relates primarily to operating losses, and other deferred tax benefits, in the run-off reinsurance operations.
Federal operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $312 million were available at December 31, 2007.These operating losses are available to only offset future taxable income of the generating company, and begin to expire in 2022.The Company has no unused capital losses as of December 31, 2007.
Current income taxes payable included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet was $236 million as of December 31, 2007 and $193 million as of December 31, 2006.
The components of income taxes for the years ended December31 were as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Current       taxes U.S.       income $ 462 $ 553 $ 73 Foreign       income 36 25 28 State       income 13 17 22 511 595 123 Deferred       taxes (benefits) U.S.       income 1 (22 ) 401 Foreign       income (2 ) (1 ) (11 ) State       income 1 - 4 - (23 ) 394 Total       income taxes $ 511 $ 572 $ 517 Total income taxes for the years ended December31 were different from the amount computed using the nominal federal income tax rate of 35% for the following reasons: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Tax       expense at nominal rate $ 571 $ 606 $ 628 Tax-exempt       interest income (32 ) (34 ) (34 ) Dividends       received deduction (3 ) (6 ) (12 ) Resolution       of federal tax matters (26 ) - (84 ) State       income tax (net of federal income tax       benefit) 10 9 18 Change       in valuation allowance (24 ) 7 15 Other 15 (10 ) (14 ) Total       income taxes $ 511 $ 572 $ 517 During 2007, the IRS completed its examination of the Companys 2003 and 2004 tax years.As a result, the Company recorded net income of $25 million, primarily attributable to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, of which:  $23       million is reflected in continuing operations;   and  $2       million is associated with the disposition of Lovelace Health Systems,       Inc. in 2003, and is reflected in discontinued   operations.
During 2005, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation approved the Company's refund claim relating to a tax loss incurred from the sale of a business in 1999 and the completion of the IRS audit for 2000-2002.Pursuant to this approval, the Company recorded total tax related benefits of $437 million consisting of:  $287       million resulting from capital losses realized in connection with the       divestiture of the property and casualty insurance operations in 1999,       which is included in income from discontinued operations;     and  $150       million resulting primarily from the release of tax reserves and valuation       allowances.Thisamount consists   of:  $88       million reported as income from continuing operations.This       amount includes $4 million of interest income;   and 94  $62       million related to the divestiture of the Company's Brazilian health care       business, which is included in income from discontinued       operations.
Review of the 2005 and 2006 tax years commenced in 2007 and is expected to be completed by mid-2009.The Company conducts business in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions, and may be engaged in various audit proceedings at any given time.Generally, no further state or foreign audit activity for years prior to 2001 is expected.
In managements opinion, adequate tax liabilities, including related interest charges should the IRS prevail, have been established to address exposures involving tax positions the Company has taken that may be challenged by the IRS.These liabilities could be revised in the near term if estimates of the Company's ultimate liability change as a result of new developments or a change in circumstances.
Note 17  Employee Incentive Plans The People Resources Committee of the Board of Directors awards stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock to certain employees.To a very limited extent, the Committee has issued common stock instead of cash compensation and dividend equivalent rights as part of restricted and deferred stock units.Stock appreciation rights issued with stock options are authorized but have not been issued for several years.The Company issues shares from Treasury stock for option exercises, awards of restricted stock and payment of deferred and restricted stock units.
All weighted average shares, per share amounts and references to stock compensation data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-one stock split.See Note 4 for more information.
Compensation cost and related tax benefits for these awards were as follows: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Compensation       cost $ 37 $ 41 $ 35 Tax       benefits $ 13 $ 14 $ 12 The Company had the following number of shares of common stock available for award at December31: 31.1 million in 2007, 33.0million in 2006 and 34.5million in 2005.
Stock options.
The Company awards options to purchase the Companys common stock at the market price of the stock on the grant date.Options vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date.
The table below shows the status of, and changes in, common stock options during the last three years: (Options       in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted Weighted Average Average Average Options Exercise       Price Options Exercise       Price Options Exercise       Price Outstanding       - January 1 17,955 $ 29.24 26,616 $ 27.50 41,076 $ 25.89 Granted 1,662 $ 46.97 1,656 $ 40.30 2,502 $ 30.05 Exercised (7,757 ) $ 27.67 (9,249 ) $ 25.90 (14,463 ) $ 23.39 Expired       or canceled (430 ) $ 34.73 (1,068 ) $ 31.80 (2,499 ) $ 27.34 Outstanding       - December 31 11,430 $ 32.69 17,955 $ 29.24 26,616 $ 27.50 Options       exercisable at year-end 8,383 $ 29.37 13,839 $ 28.94 19,542 $ 29.80 Compensation expense of $19 million related to unvested stock options at December 31, 2007 will be recognized over the next 2 years (weighted average period).
The table below summarizes information for stock options exercised during the last three years: (In       millions) 2007 2006 2005 Intrinsic       value of options exercised $ 169 $ 136 $ 148 Cash       received for options exercised $ 203 $ 212 $ 312 Excess       tax benefits realized from options       exercised $ 39 $ 28 $ 18 The following table summarizes information for outstanding common stock options at December31, 2007: (In       millions, except options in Options Options thousands) Outstanding Exercisable Number 11,430 8,383 Total       intrinsic value $ 241 $ 204 Weighted       average exercise price $ 32.69 $ 29.37 Weighted       average remaining contractual       life (years) 5.2       years 4       years 95 The weighted average fair value of options granted under employee incentive plans was $16.05 for 2007, $14.57 for 2006 and $11.39 for 2005, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following assumptions: 2007 2006 2005 Dividend       yield 0.1% 0.1% 0.1% Expected       volatility 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Risk-free       interest rate 4.7% 4.6% 3.9% Expected       option life 4       years 4.5       years 5.25       years The expected volatility reflects the Companys past daily stock price volatility.The Company does not consider volatility implied in the market prices of traded options to be a good indicator of future volatility because remaining maturities of traded options are less than one year.In 2007, the expected option life reflects the Companys historical experience excluding activity related to options granted under a replacement option feature.Prior to 2007, the Company developed the expected option life by considering certain factors, including assumptions used by other companies with comparable stock option plan features and the Companys cancellation of a replacement option feature in June 2004.
Restricted stock.
The Company makes restricted stock grants to its employees or directors with vesting periods ranging from 1 to 5 years.Recipients are entitled to receive dividends and to vote during the vesting period, but forfeit their awards if their employment terminates before the vesting date.
The table below shows the status of, and changes in, restricted stock grants during the last three years: (Grants       in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Weighted Weighted Weighted Average       Fair Value Average       Fair Value Average       Fair Value Grants at       Grant Date Grants at       Grant Date Grants at       Grant Date Outstanding       - January 1 2,802 $ 26.72 3,759 $ 21.01 3,858 $ 19.44 Granted 698 $ 47.20 645 $ 40.41 1,011 $ 30.93 Vested (750 ) $ 19.06 (1,233 ) $ 17.24 (456 ) $ 28.73 Forfeited (268 ) $ 31.45 (369 ) $ 24.13 (654 ) $ 18.84 Outstanding       - December 31 2,482 $ 34.28 2,802 $ 26.72 3,759 $ 21.01 The grant date fair value of restricted stock vested was: $14 million in 2007, $21 million in 2006 and $13 million in 2005.
At the end of 2007, approximately 2,400 employees held 2.5million restricted shares with $40 million of related compensation expense to be recognized over the next 3 years (weighted average period).
Deferred Stock.
In 2003, the Company made deferred stock unit grants with 100% vesting in three to six years, dependent on the Company's consolidated earnings per share during this vesting period.Upon meeting the stated performance objectives in 2005, the Board of Directors determined that the vesting period for the deferred stock units would be three years.On vesting in 2006, stock issuance was deferred until January of the year following an employees termination from the Company.
Note 18  Leases, Rentals and Outsourced Service Arrangements Rental expenses for operating leases, principally for office space, amounted to $114million in 2007, $104 million in 2006 and $121million in 2005.As of December31, 2007, future net minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases were approximately $430 million, payable as follows (inmillions):$92 in 2008, $81 in 2009, $67 in 2010, $56 in 2011, $42 in 2012 and $92 thereafter.
The Company also has several outsourced service arrangements with third parties, primarily for human resource and information technology support services.The initial service periods under these arrangements range from 2 to 7 years and they are reported primarily as operating leases under SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases.The Company recorded in other operating expense $87 million in 2007 and $24 million in 2006 for these arrangements.
Note 19  Segment Information The Company's operating segments generally reflect groups of related products, except for the International segment which is generally based on geography.In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, operating segments that do not require separate disclosure may be combined.The Company measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings (loss), which is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses.
Beginning in 2007, the Company reports the results of the run-off retirement business in Other Operations.Prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation.
Consolidated pre-tax income from continuing operations is primarily attributable to domestic operations.Consolidated pre-tax income from continuing operations generated by the 96 Company's foreign operations was approximately 11% in 2007, and 8% in 2006 and 5% in 2005.
The Company determines segment earnings (loss) consistent with the accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements, except that amounts included in Corporate are not allocated to segments.The Company allocates certain other operating expenses, such as systems and other key corporate overhead expenses, on systematic bases.Income taxes are generally computed as if each segment were filing a separate income tax return.The Company does not report total assets by segment since this is not a metric used to evaluate segment performance or allocation of resources.

A.
Financial Guarantees       Primarily Associated with the Sold Retirement Benefits       Business Separate account assets are contractholder funds maintained in accounts with specific investment objectives.The Company records separate account liabilities equal to separate account assets.In certain cases primarily associated with the sold retirement benefits business (which was sold in April 2004), the Company guarantees a minimum level of benefits for retirement and insurance contracts written in separate accounts.The Company establishes an additional liability if management believes that the Company will be required to make a payment under these guarantees.
The Company guarantees that separate account assets will be sufficient to pay certain retiree or life benefits.The sponsoring employers are primarily responsible for ensuring that assets are sufficient to pay these benefits and are required to maintain assets that exceed a certain percentage of benefit obligations.This percentage varies depending on the asset class within a sponsoring employers portfolio (for example, a bond fund would require a lower percentage than a riskier equity fund) and thus will vary as the composition of the portfolio changes.If employers do not maintain the required levels of separate account assets, the Company or an affiliate of the buyer has the right to redirect the management of the related assets to provide for benefit payments.As of December 31, 2007, employers maintained assets that exceeded the benefit obligations.Benefit obligations under these arrangements were $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2007.As of December 31, 2007 approximately 75% of these guarantees are reinsured by an affiliate of the buyer of the retirement benefits business.The remaining guarantees were provided by the Company with minimal reinsurance from third parties.There were no additional liabilities required for these guarantees as of December 31, 2007.
98 B.
Guaranteed Minimum       Income Benefit Contracts The Company's reinsurance operations, which were discontinued in 2000 and are now an inactive business in run-off mode, reinsured minimum income benefits under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.A contractholder can elect the guaranteed minimum income benefit within 30 days of any eligible policy anniversary after a specified contractual waiting period.The Company's exposure arises when the guaranteed annuitization benefit exceeds the annuitization benefit based on the policy's current account value.At the time of annuitization, the Company pays the excess (if any) of the guaranteed benefit over the benefit based on the current account value in a lump sum to the direct writing company.
In periods of declining equity markets and declining interest rates, the Companys liabilities for guaranteed minimum income benefits increase.Conversely, in periods of rising equity markets and rising interest rates, the Companys liabilities for these benefits decrease.
The Company estimates the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with these contracts using assumptions as to market returns and volatility of the underlying equity and bond mutual fund investments, interest rates, mortality, lapse, annuity election rates, and retrocessional credit risk.
Annuitants have only recently been able to elect to receive these minimum income benefits due to the expiration of a contractual waiting period.The Company has been monitoring annuity election rate experience and, during 2007, increased its assumption related to annuity election rates resulting in a charge (net of reinsurance) of $75 million pre-tax.Also during 2007, the Company completed a review of lapse experience for these contracts.As a result of the review, the Company decreased its lapse assumption resulting in a charge (net of reinsurance) of $11 million pre-tax; because fewer annuitants are expected to lapse coverage, the Company's expected claims increase.In combination, the Company recognized in 2007 a total charge of $56 million after-tax ($86 million pre-tax) for these changes in long-term assumptions.
The Company regularly evaluates each of the assumptions used in establishing these assets and liabilities by monitoring actual experience as it emerges over time and may change its estimates if actual experience or other evidence suggests that assumptions should be revised.If actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating these assets and liabilities, the resulting change could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, and in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition.
The following provides information about the assumptions used in calculating the assets and liabilities for guaranteed minimum income benefits:  These       liabilities represent estimates of the present value of net amounts       expected to be paid, less the present value of net future premiums       expected to be received.Included in net amounts expected to be       paid is the excess of the expected value of the income benefits over the       values of the annuitants accounts at the time of       annuitization.The assets associated with these contracts       represent receivables in connection with reinsurance that the Company has       purchasedtwo external reinsurers(see   below).
The       gross market return assumption is 8-11% varying by equity fund type; 6-7%       varying by bond fund type; and 5-6% for money market funds, reduced by       fund fees ranging 2-3% across all funds.
The       volatility assumption is 14-23% varying by equity fund type; 5-7% varying       by bond fund type; and 2-3% for money market   funds.
The       discount rate is 5.75%.
The       projected interest rate used to calculate the reinsured income benefits at       the time of annuitization varies by economic scenario, reflects interest       rates as of the valuation date, and has a long-term mean rate of 5-6% and       a standard deviation of 12-13%.
The       mortality assumption is 70% of the 1994 Group Annuity Mortality table,       with 1% annual improvement beginning January 1,   2000.
The       lapse rate assumption varies by contract from 2% to 17% and depends on the       time since contract issue, the relative value of the guarantee and the       differing experience by issuing company of the underlying variable annuity       contracts.
The       annuity election rate assumption varies by contract and depends on the       annuitants age, the relative value of the guarantee, and the differing       experience by issuing company of the underlying variable annuity       contracts.Immediately after the expiration of the waiting       period, the assumed probability that an individual will annuitize their       variable annuity contract ranges from 0% to 80%.For the second       opportunity to elect the benefit, the assumed probability of election       ranges from 0% to 45%.For each subsequent opportunity to elect       the benefit, the assumed probability of election ranges from 0% to       25%.With respect to the second and subsequent election       opportunities, actual experience data is just beginning to emerge and       managements estimates are based on this limited   data.
The Company will implement SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008.The assumptions described above will be updated to reflect a market-based view of exit price.See Note 2(B) for further information.
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had net liabilities of $313 million related to these contracts and net amounts recoverable from two external reinsurers of $197 million.The Company had an additional liability of $24 million associated with the future cost of reinsurance as of December 31, 2007.As of December 31, 2006, the Company had liabilities of $88 million related to these contracts and net amounts recoverable from two external reinsurers of $46 million.The Company 99 also had an additional liability of $47 million associated with the future cost of reinsurance as of December 31, 2006.Management believes the current assumptions used to estimate reserves for these liabilities are appropriate.
The Company is required to disclose the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for guarantees related to minimum income benefits.Under these guarantees, the future payment amounts are dependent on the equity and bond markets and interest rate levels prior to and at the date of annuitization election, which must occur within 30 days of a policy anniversary, after the appropriate waiting period.Therefore, the future payments are not fixed and determinable under the terms of the contract.Accordingly, the Company has estimated the maximum potential undiscounted future payments using hypothetical adverse assumptions, defined as follows:  No       annuitants surrendered their accounts; and  All       annuitants lived to elect their benefit; and  All       annuitants elected to receive their benefit on the next available date       (2008 through 2014); and  All       underlying mutual fund investment values remained at the December 31, 2007       value of $2.6 billion, with no future returns.
The maximum potential undiscounted payments that the Company would make under those assumptions would aggregate $881 million before reinsurance recoveries.The Company expects the amount of actual payments to be significantly less than this hypothetical undiscounted aggregate amount.The Company has retrocessional coverage in place fromtwo external reinsurers which covers 55% of the exposures on these contracts.The Company bears the risk of loss if its retrocessionaires do not meet their reinsurance obligations to the Company.
C.
Certain Other       Financial Guarantees The Company had indemnification obligations to lenders of up to $207 million as of December 31, 2007 related to borrowings by certain real estate joint ventures whichthe Company either records as an investment or consolidates.These borrowings, which are nonrecourse to the Company, are secured by the joint ventures real estate properties with fair values in excess of the loan amounts and mature at various dates from 2008 to 2017.The Companys indemnification obligations would require payment to lenders for any actual damages resulting from certain acts such as unauthorized ownership transfers, misappropriation of rental payments by others or environmental damages.Based on initial and ongoing reviews of property management and operations, the Company does not expect that payments will be required under these indemnification obligations.Any payments that might be required could be recovered through a refinancing or sale of the assets.In some cases, the Company also has recourse to partners for their proportionate share of amounts paid.There were no liabilities required for these indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2007.
As of December 31, 2007 the Company guaranteed that it would compensate the lessors for a shortfall of up to $44 million in the market value of certain leased equipment at the end of the lease.Guarantees of $28 million expire in 2012 and $16 million expire in 2016.The Company had no additional liabilities for these guarantees as of December 31, 2007.
The Company had indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2007, in connection with acquisition and disposition transactions.These indemnification obligations are triggered by the breach of representations or covenants provided by the Company, such as representations for the presentation of consolidated financial statements, the filing of tax returns, compliance with law or the identification of outstanding litigation.These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation.In some cases, the maximum potential amount due is subject to contractual limitations based on a percentage of the transaction purchase price, while in other cases limitations are not specified or applicable.The Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these obligations, since not all amounts due under these indemnification obligations are subject to limitation.There were no liabilities required for these indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2007.
The Company does not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
D.
Regulatory and       Industry Developments Employee benefits regulation.
The business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs, particularly health care programs, is heavily regulated by federal and state laws and administrative agencies, such as state departments of insurance and the federal Departments of Labor and Justice, as well as the courts .Regulation and judicial decisions have resulted in changes to industry and the Companys business practices and will continue to do so in the future.In addition, the Companys subsidiaries are routinely involved with various claims, lawsuits and regulatory and IRS audits and investigations that could result in financial liability, changes in business practices, or both.Health care regulation in its various forms could have an adverse effect on the Companys health care operations if it inhibits the Companys ability to respond to market demands or results in increased medical or administrative costs without improving the quality of care or services.
Other possible regulatory and legislative changes or judicial decisions that could have an adverse effect on the Companys employee benefits businesses include:  additional       mandated benefits or services that increase   costs;  legislation       that would grant plan participants broader rights to sue their health       plans;  changes       in public policy and in the political environment, 100 which       could affect state and federal law, including legislative and regulatory       proposals related to health care issues, which could increase cost and       affect the market for the Companys health care products and services; and       pension legislation, which could increase pension   cost;  changes       in ERISA regulations resulting in increased administrative burdens and       costs;  additional       restrictions on the use of prescription drug formularies and rulings from       pending purported class action litigation, which could result in       adjustments to or the elimination of the average wholesale price or AWP       of pharmaceutical products as a benchmark in establishing certain rates,       charges, discounts, guarantees and fees for various prescription       drugs;  additional       privacy legislation and regulations that interfere with the proper use of       medical information for research, coordination of medical care and disease       and disability management;  additional       variations among state laws mandatingthe time periods and       administrative processes for payment of health care provider       claims;  legislation       that would exempt independent physicians from antitrust laws;       and  changes       in federal tax laws, such as amendments that could affect the taxation of       employer provided benefits.
The employee benefits industry remains under scrutiny by various state and federal government agencies and could be subject to government efforts to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could previously have given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings.
Insurance-related assessments.
Many states maintain funds to pay for the operating expenses of insurance regulatory agencies and pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies.Regulators finance these funds by imposing assessments against insurance companies operating in the state.In some states, insurance companies can recover a portion of these assessments through reduced premium taxes.
As of December 31, 2007, the Companys insurance and HMO subsidiaries have recorded $17 million in liabilities and $10 million in assets for insolvency fund and other insurance-related assessments.
Concentration of risk.
South Korea represents the single largest geographic market for the Companys international businesses.In 2007, South Korea generated 31% of Internationals revenues and 41% of its segment earnings.The Companys International business in South Korea could be vulnerable to adverse consumer credit conditions and geopolitical and economic conditions in that country, which could have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results.
E.
Litigation       and Other Legal Matters The Company is routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory and IRS examinations, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of the business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs.An increasing number of claims are being made for substantial non-economic, extra-contractual or punitive damages.The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence can occur.The Company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously.Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could result in losses material to the Companys consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
Managed care litigation.
On April 7, 2000, several pending actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in a multi-district litigation proceeding captioned In re Managed Care Litigation .The consolidated cases include Shane v. Humana, Inc., et al.
(The Companys subsidiaries added as defendants in August 2000), Mangieri v. CIGNA Corporation (filed December 7, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama), Kaiser and Corrigan v. CIGNA Corporation, et al.
(class of health care providers certified on March 29, 2001) and Amer. Dental Assn v. CIGNA Corp. et. al.
(a putative class of dental providers).
In 2004, the Court approved a settlement agreement between the physician class and the Company.A dispute over disallowed claims under the settlement submitted by a representative of certain class member physicians is proceeding to arbitration.Separately, in April 2005, the Court approved a settlement between the Company and a class of non-physician health care providers.Only the Amer. Dental Assn case remains unresolved.The Companys motion to dismiss the case is pending.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, pursuant to a settlement, the Company received a $22 million pre-tax ($14 million after-tax) insurance recovery related to this litigation.In the first quarter of 2007, the Company received an additional $5 million pre-tax ($3 million after-tax) insurance recovery related to this litigation.The Company is pursuing recovery from two additional insurers.
Broker compensation.
Beginning in 2004, the Company, other insurance companies and certain insurance brokers received subpoenas and inquiries from various regulators, including the New York and Connecticut Attorneys General and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation relating to their investigations of insurance broker compensation.The Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California in October 2005 and the San Diego District Attorney in March 2006 and has provided information to them about abroker, Universal Life Resources (ULR).On June 6, 2007, the Company received a 101 letter from the San Diego District Attorney, detailing its potential claims and penalties against the Company subsidiaries, and outlining potential civil litigation.The Company denies the allegations and will vigorously defend itself in the event of litigation.In addition, in January 2006, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Labor and is providing information to that Office about another broker.The Company is cooperating with the inquiries and investigations.
On November 18, 2004, The People of the State of California by and through John Garamendi, Insurance Commissioner of the State of California v. Universal Life Resources, et al . was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego alleging that defendants (including the Company and several other insurance holding companies) failed to disclose compensation paid to ULR and that, in return for the compensation, ULR steered clients to defendants.The plaintiff sought injunctive relief only.On July 9, 2007, the parties to this lawsuit entered into a non-monetary settlement in which some of the Companys subsidiaries agreed to maintain certain disclosure practices regarding contingent compensation.This settlement does not resolve the regulators claim for recovery of attorneys fees and costs.
On August 1, 2005, two of the Companys subsidiaries, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and Life Insurance Company of North America, were named as defendants in a consolidated amended complaint captioned In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation , a multi-district litigation proceeding consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.The complaint alleges that brokers and insurers conspired to hide commissions, increasing the cost of employee benefit plans, and seeks treble damages and injunctive relief.Numerous insurance brokers and other insurance companies are named as defendants.
The court permitted plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which plaintiffs did on May 22, 2007.The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the federal antitrust, RICO and state law claims and a motion to dismiss and for summary judgment regarding the ERISA fiduciary claims.On August 31, 2007, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the federal antitrust claims.On September 28, 2007, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs RICO claims.On January 14, 2008, the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants as to plaintiffs ERISA claims.
On February 13, 2008, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs' state law claims and the complaint in its entirety.The court ordered the clerk to enter judgment against plaintiffs and in favor of the defendants.Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.The Company denies the allegations and will continue to vigorously defend itself.
Amara cash balance pension plan litigation.
On December 18, 2001, Janice Amara filed a purported class action lawsuit, now captioned Janice C. Amara, Gisela R. Broderick, Annette S. Glanz, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. CIGNA Corporation and CIGNA Pension Plan, in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against CIGNA Corporation and the CIGNA Pension Plan on behalf of herself and other similarly situated participants in the CIGNA Pension Plan affected by the 1998 conversion to a cash balance formula.The plaintiffs allege various ERISA violations including, among other things, that the Plans cash balance formula discriminates against older employees; the conversion resulted in a wear away period (during which the pre-conversion accrued benefit exceeded the post-conversion benefit); and these conditions are not adequately disclosed in the Plan.The plaintiffs were granted class certification on December 20, 2002, and seek equitable relief.A non-jury trial began on September 11-15, 2006.Due to the courts schedule, the proceedings were adjourned and the trial was completed on January 25, 2007.On February 15, 2008, the court issued a decision finding in favor of CIGNA Corporation and the CIGNA Pension Plan on the age discrimination and wear away claims and finding in favor of the plaintiffs on many aspects of the disclosure claims.The court has ordered the parties to file simultaneous briefs on March 17, 2008 regarding the relief, if any, to be awarded to the plaintiffs on the claims on which the plaintiffs prevailed, and to file responsive briefs on March 31, 2008.The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself in this case.
Boon Insurance Agency .
On February 14, 2007, the Boon Insurance Agency and an affiliated company filed a complaint in Texas state court against two CIGNA subsidiaries and a co-defendant alleging breach of contract and fraudulent inducement in regard to several agreements with plaintiffs in connection with the marketing, production and servicing of voluntary health insurance policies.Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, punitive damages and declaratory relief against the Company.Discovery is ongoing, and is scheduled to be completed by June 23, 2008.The case is set for jury trial on September 22, 2008.The Company denies the allegations and will vigorously defend itself in this case.
Run-off reinsurance litigation.
In connection with the Companys run-off reinsurance operations described in Note 8, the Company purchased extensive retrocessional reinsurance for its Unicover contracts and also for some other segments of its non-Unicover business.During 2007, CIGNA entered into a settlement that resolved the appeal of an adverse court award in a retrocessional enforcement arbitration.That appeal, captioned CIGNA EUROPE INSURANCE COMPANY SA-NV v. John Hancock Life Insurance Company, was pending in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court and the case was dismissed in the fourth quarter of 2007.Other disputes concerning retrocessional contracts have been substantially resolved or settled.
102 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of CIGNA Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CIGNA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("the Company") at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Various       indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries have obtained surety bonds in the       normal course of business.If there is a claim on a surety bond       and the subsidiary is unable to pay, the Company guarantees payment to the       company issuing the surety bond.The aggregate amount of such       surety bonds as of December 31, 2007 was $58   million.
