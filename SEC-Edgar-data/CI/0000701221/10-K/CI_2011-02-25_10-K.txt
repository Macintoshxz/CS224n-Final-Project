Its subsidiaries are major providers of health care and related       benefits, the majority of which are offered through the workplace, including       health care products and services, group disability, life and accident       insurance, and disability and workers compensation case management and related       services. CIGNAs major insurance subsidiary, Connecticut General Life Insurance       Company (CG Life), traces its origins to 1865. CIGNA Corporation was       incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1981.

3 C.
Health       Care CIGNAs       Health Care operations offer insured and self-funded medical, dental, behavioral       health, prescription drug and other products and services that may be integrated       to support consumer-focused health care programs. These operations also provide       disability and life insurance products which were historically sold in       connection with certain experience-rated medical products.
These       products and services are provided and administered by subsidiaries of CIGNA       Corporation.
Industry       and Strategic Overview CIGNA       believes that the health care business model is evolving to one that focuses       more directly on the role of the health care consumer.
Engaging       consumers more closely in health care decisions can result in improved health       care outcomes and remove unnecessary costs from the system.
Consumerism represents a transition from a cost-based business model to a       value-based model. Using this model, CIGNA seeks to provide actionable       information about provider quality and cost, customer support tools and       services, and health advocacy support, to assist consumers in making more       informed choices regarding their health care and in achieving better health       outcomes .
CIGNA       has       developed products, educational resources and customer support tools for       consumers and capabilities to       provide information to employers about the health needs of their plan       participants.
CIGNA       believes that its capabilities in consumerism, health advocacy and providing       useful information to consumers, employers, and providers positions the Company       to meet the emerging market need.
CIGNA       continually evaluates potential acquisitions and other transactions that present       opportunities to enhance its product capabilities and provide a basis for lower       medical costs. As part of that strategy, in 2006 CIGNA:  acquired                 the voluntary health insurance business of Star-HRG SM ;  transitioned                 business from a health care industry competitor in the Arizona market;  entered                 into strategic alliances with several regional managed care organizations                 including Tufts Health Plan, HealthPartners, Inc., Health Alliance                 Plan,                 and MVP Health Plan;  acquired                 vielife Holdings, a U.K. based provider of integrated online health                 management and coaching programs;  negotiated                 to acquire Mid-South Administrative Group, LLC, a Memphis, Tennessee-based                 company that designs and administers self-funded health care benefits                 (and                 acquired the company on January 1, 2007);                 and  entered                 into an agreement with the University of Michigan in order to access                 certain intellectual property related to identification of health                 risks                 and employer worksite health and wellness                 programs.
Products       and Services The       customers of CIGNAs Health Care operations range in size from some of the       largest United States corporations to small enterprises, and include employers,       multiple employer groups, unions, and governmental entities. Products are       marketed in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S.       Virgin Islands and Canada.
Medical CIGNA       provides a wide array of products and services to meet the needs of employers       and other sponsors of health benefit plans and the employees and dependents       participating in these plans, including consumer-directed health plans, health       maintenance organizations (HMOs), network only (Network) and       point-of-service (POS) medical plans, preferred provider plans (PPOs), and       traditional medical indemnity coverage.
CIGNA       offers a modular product portfolio, including CIGNATURE  ,       CareAllies SM , and       CIGNA       Choice Fund  solutions, which offer a choice of benefit, participating provider network,       funding, medical management, consumerism and health advocacy options for       employers and consumers. Through its CareAllies SM brand,       CIGNA provides medical management, disease 4 management,       and health advocacy services to large plan sponsors that allow their employees       to choose from among multiple health care vendors. CareAllies SM offers a       consistent set of services to address the clinical and administrative       inconsistencies that are inherent in the multi-vendor approach.
To       improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs, it is CIGNA's goal to       provide customers who purchasemore than one product (includingany       combination ofmedical, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy and medical       care management features) with: (1) a holistic and integrated approach       towardmembers'health that promotes consistent case management; and       (2) the integration of health care information through predictive modeling       and       other tools, to provide targeted outreach and health advocacy by CIGNA's       clinical professionals.
As       part       of its commitment to help members anticipate and manage their health care costs       and to address provider debt concerns, CIGNA will pilot a new payment process       in       limited locations in 2007. The process is designed to allow members and       providers to obtain a real-time treatment cost estimate reflecting the members       actual co-pays and deductibles, and facilitate payment to providers from sources       such as the members health savings account or line of credit.
CIGNA       strengthened its presence in the voluntary benefits marketplace with the       acquisition of the Star HRG SM voluntary health insurance business and the creation of the Fundamental       Care SM product       offering for companies with 51 or more eligible employees. This product is       designed to be more affordable than traditional major medical coverage.       Fundamental Care SM meets the need for a voluntary medical product for       the working uninsured that provides higher coverage levels than limited benefit       plans.
CIGNA       is       also developing technology tools to assist employers in choosing product designs       to achieve better health outcomes for their plan participants. For example,       CIGNAs Hi Score  tool       aggregates employee plan participant data (not identifiable by individual)       in       four categories: (1) frequency and type of health care services provided; (2)       level of employee engagement in health care decisions; (3) effectiveness of       existing incentives in meeting employee population objectives; and (4)       opportunities for outreach to employees. Hi Score  ranks       the employer in each of these categories to show the employers current       performance compared to the original baseline and the employers industry peer       group, with the goal of enabling employers to modify actions to potentially       improve employee health outcomes and, consequently, cost trends.
Consumer-Directed       Health Plans.
CIGNA       offers customers the CIGNA Choice Fund  suite of consumer-directed       health plan products. T he       CIGNA       Choice Fund  includes       health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) and health       savings account (HSA) options. The HRA combines flexible benefit plan designs       and the ability of employers to allow roll over reimbursement accounts from       year       to year with enhanced decision support tools and consumer incentive programs.       The HSA combines a high deductible payment feature for the health plan with       a       tax-preferred account offering mutual fund investment options. Funds in the       HSA       can be used to pay the deductible and for other eligible tax-deductible medical       expenses.
In       2006,       CIGNA enhanced its portfolio of offerings to provide more flexible versions       of       the standard HRA. CIGNA introduced the Healthy Rewards  HRA, which facilitates the deposit of financial incentives to reward healthy       activities, and the Healthy Futures HRA, a retirement HRA. Additionally, CIGNA       expanded the availability of its HRA plans to businesses with 51-200 employees       in eight additional states, so that these plans are now available to small       businesses in a total of 30 states. Working with JPMorgan Chase Bank, mutual       fund investment options are made available to CIGNA's HSA accountholders as       a       means of investing HSA funds.
HMOs.
HMOs       are       required by law to provide coverage for all basic health services. They use       various tools to facilitate the appropriate use of health care services by       members and providers and control unit costs through provider contracts. Members       typically choose a primary care physician from CIGNAs provider network who is       responsible for the members primary medical       and preventive care.
Members       may be required to obtain referrals from their primary care physicians to       receive covered non-emergency services from 5 participating       specialists or facilities. CIGNA also offers an open access HMO product that       allows members to obtain covered services without the requirement of a referral       from the primary care physician.
Other       than CIGNA HealthCare of Arizona, Inc., a staff model HMO which employs some       physicians and other providers, all CIGNA HMOs are individual practice       association models using networks of independent physicians, hospitals and       other       health care providers that have directly or indirectly contracted with the       HMO.
Currently,       many contracted providers are compensated by CIGNA on a discounted       fee-for-service or other service-specific basis (such as hospital per diems       or       case rates) for covered health care services provided to members. Certain       contracted providers agree to provide covered services in consideration for       receiving a monthly predetermined fee (capitation) from CIGNA. Capitation       arrangements shift some of the financial risk from CIGNA to the providers.
In       some       cases, capitated providers subcontract with other providers for certain health       care services. In the event that the capitated provider is paid but fails to       pay       its subcontracted providers, the subcontracted providers or regulators may       look       to CIGNA for payment.
CIGNA       contracts with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to       provide Medicare HMO coverage for eligible individuals in Arizona. The contract       provides for a fixed, per member per month, premium from CMS, based upon a       formula that calculates the projected cost of providing services for each       Medicare member. Premium amounts are updated annually. Members generally receive       enhanced benefits over standard Medicare fee-for-service coverage, including       prescription drug and vision coverage, and pay lower, fixed co-payments for       services used. Depending on the plan benefits selected, members may be required       to pay an additional premium to CIGNA for their HMO coverage.
Network       and POS Medical Products.
CIGNA       offers Network products that cover non-emergency services provided only by       CIGNA       participating providers and emergency services provided by participating and       non-participating providers. CIGNA also offers POS medical plans that cover       health care services provided by participating and non-participating health       care       providers. This allows participants to determine at the point of service (POS) whether to obtain covered services from a CIGNA participating provider       (In-Network services) or from a non-participating provider (Out-of-Network services). Participants in POS plans generally pay a fixed co-payment or       co-insurance amount for In-Network covered services. Reimbursement for       Out-of-Network covered services is subject to deductibles and coinsurance,       which       result in a higher cost to participants than In-Network services. CIGNA offers       POS products that allow access to In-Network specialty care without the       requirement of a referral from the primary care physician.
Some       of       CIGNAs POS products require that the participant receive a referral from a       primary care physician participating in the CIGNA provider network for coverage       of non-emergency specialty care services. As part of this product, the       participant selects a primary care physician and the higher In-Network       reimbursement for specialty care services is available only if the participant       has a referral from his or her primary care physician to a specialty care       provider in the CIGNA network.
PPO       Medical Products.
CIGNA       also offers exclusive provider organization (EPO) and PPO plans. EPO and PPO       plans are similar to HMO and POS plans, respectively, e xcept       the       network of CIGNA participating providers is national, rather than defined by       geographical areas and is larger than the HMO and POS participating provider       network. An EPO plan does not generally provide for out-of-network coverage       for       non-emergent care. For PPO plans, the participants coinsurance obligation is       greater for Out-of-Network services than it is for In-Network       services.
Traditional       Medical Indemnity Products.
Traditional       medical indemnity products provide reimbursement for covered services without       regard to whether the provider of the covered service participates in the CIGNA       provider network. Participants are responsible for sharing in the cost of their       care by paying deductibles and coinsurance, subject to annual out-of-pocket       maximums.
6 CIGNA       HealthCare of Arizona, Inc. is also a participating provider in the       fee-for-service Medicare program, furnishing outpatient care to Medicare       beneficiaries. Reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient services is made       by       CMS pursuant to laws and regulations governing the Medicare program. Currently,       CMS reimburses outpatient services in accordance with payment classification       groups based on historical cost information filed by CIGNA HealthCare of       Arizona, Inc.
Dental CIGNA       offers a variety of dental care products including managed care, dental       preferred provider organization (DPPO), dental exclusive provider organization       (DEPO) and traditional indemnity products. Customers can purchase CIGNA dental       products as stand-alone products or integrated with CIGNA medical products.       Customers have access to live service representatives and on-line assistance       through CIGNA's secure member website, myCIGNA.com.
Managed       dental care products are offered in 36 states and the District of Columbia       through a network of independent providers that have contracted with CIGNA       to       provide dental services to members. Most dentists in the CIGNA network receive       a       monthly predetermined fee (capitation) for each covered member in their patient       panel. Network dentists may also receive additional fees for certain services.       Generally, members are responsible for a fixed co-payment for certain covered       services provided by a network dentist. Members typically choose a primary       care       dentist from CIGNA's provider network. Members are generally required to obtain       referrals from their primary care general dentist to receive covered       non-emergency services from participating specialists.
CIGNA       also offers DPPO products similar to the medical PPO products described above.       As of December 31, 2006, CIGNAs national DPPO network had approximately 46,800       (42,400 as of December 31, 2005) participating dentists with approximately       87,600 (70,200 as of December 31, 2005) contracted access points.
In       addition, CIGNA offers DEPO products that generally offer in-network only       benefit coverage. DEPO plans do not require the selection of a primary care       general dentist and do not require referrals to in-network specialists.
Traditional       dental indemnity products also operate in a manner consistent with that       described with respect to medical indemnity products, above.
Behavioral       Health CIGNA       provides behavioral health care benefit products, behavioral health care       management, employee assistance programs, and work/life programs to employer       sponsored benefit plans, HMOs, governmental entities and disability insurers.       CIGNA focuses on integrating its programs and services to provide the consumer       with customized, holistic care through such products as:  Custom                 Network Solutions, introduced on January 1, 2006, which gives employers                 the ability to select four different provider network options to                 meet the                 specific needs of their plan participants;                 and  customized                 on-line self-assessment and help tools for a variety of concerns,                 including stress, grief, relationship issues and depression, that                 connect                 consumers to a telephonic or face-to-face counselor as                 appropriate.
As       of       December 31, 2006, CIGNA's behavioral care national network had approximately       55,200 access points to independent psychiatrists, psychologists and clinical       social workers and approximately 5,000 facilities and clinics that are paid       on a       contracted fee-for-service basis. As of December 31, 2005, CIGNA's behavioral       care national network had approximately 53,700 access points to independent       psychiatrists, psychologists and clinical social workers and approximately       5,000       facilities and clinics that are paid on a contracted fee-for-service basis.
Pharmacy CIGNA       offers to its insured and self-funded customers prescription drug plans both       in       conjunction with its medical products described above and on a stand alone       basis. CIGNA has a nationwide network of approximately 57,400 contracted       pharmacies that it uses in connection 7 with       its       HMO, Network, POS, PPO and Choice Fund products. In addition, CIGNA provides       managed pharmacy benefit programs in connection with its HMO and POS products       as       wells as Pharmacy Outcome Improvement programs that take a holistic approach       to       helping improve outcomes for members and managing medical costs for customers.
CIGNA       also offers cost-effective mail order, telephone and on-line pharmaceutical       fulfillment services through its CIGNA Tel-Drug  operation .       In 2006, CIGNA launched new preventive prescription drug plan options to promote       medication compliance by providing a higher level of benefits coverage to       members enrolled in high-deductible plans who need certain medications to       prevent illness or to address specified chronic health care       conditions.
In       addition, CIGNA has made available on-line pharmacy decision support tools       including:  a                 prescription drug price comparison tool that gives members price                 comparisons on branded and generic drugs from pharmacy retailers                 and mail                 order, showing out-of-pocket as well as total anticipated costs,                 of the                 prescription;  DrugCompare                 and Medication Library where members can obtain detailed information                 and                 comparisons of medications; and  Prescription                 Claim History Tool, which enables consumers to see their combined                 retail                 and home delivery prescription history to help plan for and track                 out-of-pocket expenses.
In       2005,       CIGNA introduced CIGNATURE Rx SM ,       its       Medicare Part D prescription drug program, which provides a number of plan       options as well as service and information support. CIGNATURE Rx SM is       provided in alliance with NationsHealth, Inc., and combines CIGNA's pharmacy       product capabilities with NationsHealths service and distribution capabilities.       CIGNATURE Rx SM is       available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Care       Management CIGNA       strives to help consumers make more informed health care decisions by providing       a number of care management and health advocacy programs and information support       tools that are designed to help improve health and cost outcomes. Some of these       include:  early                 intervention by CIGNA's network of over 2,500 clinical                 professionals;  targeted                 outreach using CIGNA's predictive modeling capabilities through tools                 such                 as the CIGNA Health Advisor Portal;  the                 integration of medical, disability and specialty (pharmacy, dental                 and                 behavioral) care to help with consistent case management; and  disease                 management programs, including CIGNA Well Aware for Better                 Health  ,                 which focuses on chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart                 disease, low back pain, depression, weight complications, chronic                 obstructive pulmonary disease, and other targeted conditions.
CIGNA       has       developed a range of consumer decision support tools including:  myCIGNA.com, CIGNAs                 consumer Internet portal. The portal is personalized with each members                 CIGNA medical, dental and pharmacy plan information;  myCignaPlans.com,                 a website which allows prospective members to compare plan coverage                 and                 pricing options, before enrolling, based on a variety of factors.                 The                 application gives consumers information on the total health care                 cost to                 them and their employer;  a                 number of interactive online cost and quality information tools that                 compare hospital quality and efficiency information, prescription                 drug                 choices and average price estimates and member-specific average                 out-of-pocket costs estimates for certain medical procedures;                 and 8  Health                 Risk Assessment, an online interactive tool through which consumers                 can                 identify potential health risks and monitor their health status.
Quality CIGNA's       commitment to promoting quality care is reflected in a variety of activities,       including: the credentialing of medical providers and facilities that       participate in CIGNA's managed care and PPO networks; the development of the       CIGNA Care Network  described below, a national externally accredited Quality Program, that includes       clinical interventions and quality measurement; and participation in initiatives       that provide hospital and physician profiling information to members for more       educated decision making.
Participating       Provider Network .
CIGNA       has       an extensive national network of participating health care providers, which       as       of December 31, 2006 consisted of approximately 5,000 hospitals and       approximately 518,600 providers as well as other facilities, pharmacies and       vendors of health care services and supplies. As of December 31, 2005, CIGNA's       national network of participating health care providers consisted of       approximately 4,800 hospitals and approximately 500,700 providers.
In       most       instances, a CIGNA subsidiary contracts directly with the participating provider       to provide covered services to members at agreed-upon rates of reimbursement.       In       some instances, however, CIGNA companies contract with third parties for access       to their provider networks. In addition, CIGNA has entered into strategic       alliances with several regional managed care organizations (Tufts Health Plan,       HealthPartners, Inc., Health Alliance Plan, and MVP Health Plan) to gain access       to their market leading provider networks and discounts.
CIGNA       Care Network  .
CIGNA       Care Network is a benefit design option available for CIGNA plans in 62 service       areas across the country.
CIGNA       Care Network  is a       subset of participating physicians in certain specialties who are designated       as       CIGNA Care Network  providers based on specific quality and efficiency selection criteria. Consumers       pay reduced co-payments or co-insurance when they receive care from a specialist       designated as a CIGNA Care Network  provider. CIGNA participating s pecialists       are evaluated annually for the CIGNA Care Network  designation.
Provider       Credentialing.
CIGNA       credentials physicians, hospitals and other health care providers in its       participating provider networks using quality criteria which meets or exceeds       the standards of external accreditation or state regulatory agencies, or both.       Typically, most providers are recredentialed every three years.
To       be       credentialed, CIGNA requires the medical facilities with which it contracts       to       have an unrestricted state license, no sanctions by the Department of Health       and       Human Services, accreditation by an approved accrediting organization and       adequate malpractice and general liability coverage. Typically, medical       facilities are recredentialed every three years.
NCQA       Accreditation.
Accreditation       by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) of CIGNAs medical HMOs       validates CIGNAs quality program. The NCQA is a nationally recognized       independent, not-for-profit organization dedicated to assessing, measuring       and       reporting on the quality of managed care plans.
As       of       December 31, 2006, 96% of CIGNAs U.S. plan locations are NCQA accredited and,       as of January, 2007, 100% of these accredited plans have received Excellent       or       Commendable accreditation for HMO and POS products.
HEDIS  Measures.
In       addition, CIGNA participates in NCQAs Health Plan Employer Data and Information       Set (HEDIS) Quality Compass Report. HEDIS Effectiveness of Care measures are a       standard set of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of managed care       organization clinical programs. CIGNAs national results compare favorably to       industry averages.
Markets       and Distribution CIGNA       the       following targeted market segments for its products:  national                 accounts, which are multi-site employers with more than 5,000                 employees; 9  regional                 accounts, which are generally defined as multi-site employers with                 more                 than 50 but fewer than 5,000                 employees;  small                 business and individual, which includes employers with fewer than                 50                 employees and individuals;  government,                 which includes employees                 in federal, state and local governments, primary and secondary schools,                 and colleges and universities ;  Taft-Hartley,                 which includes members                 covered by union trust funds;  seniors,                 which focuses on the health care needs of individuals 55 years and                 older;                 and  emerging,                 which includes the voluntary segment enhanced through the acquisition                 of                 Star HRG SM .
To       date,       the national and regional account markets have comprised a significant amount       of       CIGNA's Health Care business. CIGNA intends to grow its business in the small       business, individual, government, Taft-Hartley, seniors and emerging markets.
CIGNA       employs group sales representatives to distribute the products and services       of       the markets listed above through insurance brokers, insurance consultants and       directly to employers. CIGNA also employs representatives to sell medical cost       containment, managed behavioral health care and employee assistance services       directly to insurance companies, HMOs, third party administrators and employer       groups. As of December 31, 2006, the field sales force for the products and       services of this segment consisted of approximately 800 sales representatives       in       67 field locations.
Funding Arrangements The       segments health care products and services are offered through guaranteed cost,       retrospectively experience-rated, administrative services only (ASO) and       minimum premium funding arrangements.
Under       guaranteed cost funding arrangements, CIGNA charges a fixed premium and bears       the risk for claims and costs that exceed the premium.
Under       retrospectively experience-rated funding arrangements, a premium that typically       includes a margin to partially protect against adverse claim fluctuations is       determined at the beginning of the policy period. CIGNA generally bears the       risk       if claims and expenses exceed premiums, but has the potential to recover these       deficits from margins in future years if coverage is renewed. For additional       discussion, see Pricing, Reserves and Reinsurance below.
Under       ASO       funding arrangements, the employer or other plan sponsor self-funds, or assumes       the risk for, all of its claims and assumes the risk for claim costs incurred.       CIGNA makes available to ASO plans its participating provider network and       typically provides claims processing and other services and programs, including:       quality management, utilization management; cost containment; health advocacy;       24-hour help line; case management; disease management; pharmacy benefit       management; behavioral health care management services (through its provider       networks); or a combination of the above, in exchange for administrative service       fees. The employer/plan sponsor is responsible for self-funding all claims,       but       may purchase stop-loss insurance from CIGNA or other insurers for claims in       excess of some predetermined amount in total, for specific individuals, the       entire group in aggregate, or both.
Minimum       premium funding arrangements combine insurance protection with an element of       self-funding. The policyholder is responsible for funding all claims up to       a       predetermined aggregate, maximum amount, and CIGNA bears the risk for claim       costs incurred in excess of that amount. CIGNA has the potential to recover       this       deficit from margins in future years if the policy is renewed. Accordingly,       minimum premium funding arrangements have a risk profile similar to       retrospectively experience-rated insurance arrangements.
Pricing,       Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums       and fees charged for most insured health care products and for disability and       life insurance products are generally set in advance 10 of       the       policy period and are guaranteed for one year.
Premium       rates are established either on a guaranteed cost basis or on a retrospectively       experience-rated basis.
Charges       to customers established on a guaranteed cost basis at the beginning of the       policy period cannot be adjusted to reflect actual claim experience during       the       policy period. A guaranteed cost pricing methodology reflects assumptions about       future claims, expenses, credit risk, enrollment mix, investment returns, and       profit margins. Claim and expense assumptions may be based in whole or in part       on prior experience of the account or on a pool of accounts, depending on the       group size and the statistical credibility of the experience. Generally,       guaranteed cost groups are smaller and less statistically credible than       retrospectively experience-rated groups. In addition, pricing for health care       products that use networks of contracted providers reflects assumptions about       the impact of provider contracts on future claims. Premium rates may vary among       accounts to reflect the anticipated contract mix, family size, industry, renewal       date, and other cost-predictive factors. In some states, premium rates must       be       approved by the state insurance departments, and state laws may restrict or       limit the use of rating methods.
Premiums       established for retrospectively experience-rated business may be adjusted for       the actual claim and administrative cost experience of the account through       an       experience settlement process subsequent to the policy period. To the extent       that the cost experience is favorable in relation to the prospectively       determined premium rates, a portion of the initial premiums may be credited       to       the policyholder as an experience refund. If claim experience is adverse in       relation to the initial premiums, CIGNA may recover the resulting experience       deficit, according to contractual provisions, through future premiums and       experience settlements, provided the policy remains in force.
CIGNA       contracts on an ASO basis with customers who fund their own claims. CIGNA       charges these customers administrative fees based on the expected cost of       administering their self-funded programs. In some cases, CIGNA provides       performance guarantees related to identified performance. If these standards       are       not met, CIGNA may be financially at risk up to a percentage of the contracted       fee or a stated dollar amount.
In       addition to paying current benefits and expenses under insurance policies and       HMO service agreements, CIGNA establishes reserves in amounts estimated to       be       sufficient to settle reported claims not yet paid, as well as claims incurred       but not yet reported. Also, liabilities are established for estimated experience       refunds based on the results of retrospectively experience-rated policies and       applicable contract terms.
As       of       December 31, 2006, approximately $1.1 billion, or 39% of the reserves of CIGNA's       Health Care operations comprise liabilities that are likely to be paid within       one year, primarily for medical and dental claims, as well as certain group       disability and life insurance claims. Of the reserve amount expected to be       paid       within one year, $250 million relates to amounts recoverable from certain ASO       customers and from minimum premium policyholders, and is offset by a receivable.       The remaining reserves related primarily to liabilities that are short term       with       a long tail and include liabilities for group long-term disability insurance       benefits and group life insurance benefits for disabled and retired individuals,       benefits paid in the form of both life and non-life contingent annuities to       survivors and contract holder deposit funds.
CIGNA       credits interest on fund balances to retrospectively experience-rated       policyholders through rates that are set at CIGNAs discretion taking investment       performance and market rates into consideration. Generally, for       interest-crediting rates set at CIGNAs discretion, higher rates are credited to       funds with longer terms reflecting the fact that higher yields are generally       available on investments with longer maturities. For 2006, the rates of interest       credited ranged from 2.5% to 4.4%, with a weighted average rate of       3.4%.
The       profitability of CIGNA's fully insured health care products depends on the       adequacy of premiums charged relative to claims and expenses. For medical and       dental products, profitability reflects the accuracy of cost projections for       health care (unit costs and utilization), the adequacy of fees charged for       administration and risk assumption and effective medical cost and utilization       management.
11 CIGNA       reduces its exposure to large catastrophe losses under group life, disability       and accidental death contracts by purchasing reinsurance from unaffiliated       reinsurers.
Competition CIGNA's       health care businesses are subject to intense competition, and industry       consolidation has created an even more competitive business environment. While       no one competitor or small number of competitors dominates the health care       market, CIGNA expects a continuing trend of consolidation in the industry with       the emergence of consumerism intensifying this trend.
In       certain geographic locations some health care companies may have significant       market share positions. A large number of health care companies and other       entities compete in offering similar products. Competition in the health care       market exists both for employer-policyholders and for the employees in those       instances where the employer offers its employees the choice of products of       more       than one health care company. Most group policies are subject to annual review       by the policyholder, who may seek competitive quotations prior to renewal.
The       principal competitive factors are: quality of service; scope; cost-effectiveness       and quality of provider networks; effectiveness of medical care management;       product responsiveness to the needs of customers and their employees;       cost-containment services; technology; price; and effectiveness of marketing       and       sales. In addition, financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings       issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also a competitive factor.       For more information concerning insurance ratings, see Ratings in Section K       beginning on page 28 . CIGNA believes that its national       scope, integrated approach to consumerism, product breadth, clinical care and       medical management capabilities and funding options are strategic competitive       advantages. These advantages allow CIGNA to respond to the diverse needs of       its       customer base in each market in which it operates.
The       principal competitors of CIGNAs health care businesses are:  other                 large insurance companies that provide group health and life insurance                 products;  Blue                 Cross and Blue Shield                 organizations;  stand-alone                 HMOs and PPOs;  HMOs                 affiliated with major insurance companies and hospitals;                 and  national                 managed pharmacy, behavioral health and cost containment services                 companies.
Competition       also arises from smaller regional or specialty companies with strength in a       particular geographic area or product line, administrative service firms and,       indirectly, self-insurers. In addition to these traditional competitors, a       new       group of competitors is emerging. These new competitors are focused on       delivering employee benefits and services through Internet-enabled technology       that allow consumers to take a more active role in the management of their       health. This is accomplished primarily through financial incentives and access       to enhanced medical quality data.
The       effective use of web-based information tools and technology are critical to       success in the health care industry, and CIGNA believes they will be competitive       differentiators.
Management       believes that it has the capabilities and appropriate strategy to allow it       to       compete against both traditional and new competitors.

Disability       and Life Principal       Products and Markets CIGNA's       Disability and Life operations provide the following insurance products and       their related services: long-term and short-term disability insurance,       disability and workers compensation case management, group life insurance, and       accident and specialty insurance. These products and services are provided       by       subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation. CIGNA markets these group insurance products       and services to employers, employees, professional and other associations and       other groups.
The       following table sets forth the net premiums and fees for this segment by its       principal products.
Year                 Ended December                 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In                 millions) Life $ 1,050 $ 1,108 $ 1,041 Disability 798 677 617 Other 260 280 265 Total                 Premiums and                 Fees $ 2,108 $ 2,065 $ 1,923 Life       Insurance Group       life insurance products include group term life and group universal life. CIGNA       no longer markets group variable universal life insurance, but continues to       administer the product for existing policyholders. Group term life insurance       may       be employer-paid basic life insurance or employee-paid supplemental life       insurance.
Group       universal life insurance is a voluntary life insurance product in which the       owner may accumulate cash value. The cash value earns interest at rates declared       from time to time, subject to a minimum guaranteed rate, and may be borrowed,       withdrawn, or used to fund future life insurance coverage. With group variable       universal life insurance, the cash value varies directly with the performance       of       the underlying investments and neither the return nor the principal is       guaranteed.
Approximately       5,700 group life insurance policies covering approximately 5.8 million lives       were outstanding as of December 31, 2006.
Disability       Insurance CIGNA       markets group long-term and short-term disability insurance products and       services in all states and statutorily required disability insurance plans       in       certain states. These products and services generally provide a fixed level       of       income to replace a portion of wages lost because of disability. They also       provide assistance to the employee in returning to work and assistance to the       employer in managing the cost of employee disability. Group disability coverage       is typically employer-paid, but may also be employee-paid or a combination       of       employer and employee-paid.
CIGNA       also provides case management and related services to workers compensation       insurers and employers who self-fund workers compensation and disability       benefits.
CIGNAs       disability insurance products may be coordinated with behavioral programs,       workers compensation, medical programs, social security advocacy, and the       Family and Medical Leave Act and leave of absence administration. CIGNA believes       this integration provides customers with increased efficiency and effectiveness       in disability claims management. CIGNA may receive fees for providing       integration services to clients.
Other,       Including Voluntary CIGNA       offers personal accident insurance coverage, which consists primarily of       accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident insurance to employers.       Group accident insurance may be employer-paid or employee-paid.
CIGNA       also offers specialty insurance services that consist primarily of life,       accident and disability insurance to professional associations, financial       institutions, schools and participant organizations.
13 CIGNA       enhanced its voluntary benefits offering in September 2006. Voluntary benefits       are principally paid by the employee and are offered at the employers worksite.       CIGNA plans provide, among other services, flexible enrollment options, list       billing, medical underwriting, and individual record keeping. CIGNA designed       this voluntary platform to offer employers a complete and simple way to manage       their benefits, including personalized enrollment communication and full program       administration.
Distribution CIGNA       employs group sales representatives to distribute the products and services       of       this segment through insurance brokers and consultants. As of December 31,       2006,       the field sales force for the products and services of this segment consisted       of       approximately 200 sales representatives in 27 field locations .
Pricing,       Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums       and fees charged for disability and life insurance products are generally       established in advance of the policy period and are often guaranteed for two       to       three years, but contracts may be subject to termination.
Premium       rates reflect assumptions about future claims, expenses, credit risk, investment       returns and profit margins. Claim and expense assumptions may be based in whole       or in part on prior experience of the account or on a pool of accounts,       depending on the group size and the statistical credibility of the experience.
Fees       for       universal life insurance products consist of mortality, administrative and       surrender charges assessed against the contractholders fund balance. Interest       credited and mortality charges for universal life, and mortality charges on       variable universal life, may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected       interest and mortality experience.
In       addition to paying current benefits and expenses, CIGNA establishes reserves       in       amounts estimated to be sufficient to settle reported claims not yet paid,       as       well as claims incurred but not yet reported. For liabilities with longer-term       pay-out periods such as long-term disability, reserves represent the present       value of future expected payments.
CIGNA       discounts these reserves based on interest rate assumptions. The annual       effective interest rate assumption used in determining reserves for most of       the       long-term disability insurance business is 4.75% for claims that were incurred       in 2006 and 5.00% for claims that were incurred in 2005.
For       universal life insurance, CIGNA establishes reserves for deposits received       and       interest credited to the contractholder, less mortality and administrative       charges assessed against the contractholders fund balance.
The       profitability of this segments products depends on the adequacy of premiums       charged relative to claims and expenses. Effectiveness of return to work       programs as well as adequate return on invested assets impact the profitability       of disability insurance products. For life insurance products, the degree to       which future experience deviates from mortality, morbidity and expense       assumptions affects profitability.
CIGNA       reduces its exposure to large individual and catastrophe losses under group       life, disability and accidental death contracts by purchasing       reinsurance.
Competition The       principal competitive factors that affect the products of the Disability and       Life segment are underwriting and pricing, relative operating efficiency,       distribution methodologies and producer relations, the variety of products       and       services offered, and the quality of customer service and claims       management.
For       certain products with longer-term liabilities, such as group long-term       disability insurance, the financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by       ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also a competitive       factor. For more information concerning insurance ratings, see Ratings in       Section K beginning on page 28 .
The       principal competitors of CIGNAs group disability, life and accident businesses       are other large and regional insurance companies that market and distribute       these products.
As       of       December 31, 2006, CIGNA is one of the top five providers of group disability,       life and accident insurance, based on premiums.
14 E.
International CIGNAs       international operations offer life, accident and supplemental health insurance       products and international health care products and services. These products       and       services are provided by subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation, including foreign       operating entities.
The       following table sets forth the two principal lines of business of CIGNA       International and their related net earned premiums and fees.
Year                 Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In                 millions) Life,                 Accident and Supplemental Health Insurance $ 824 $ 677 $ 545 International                 Health Care Benefits 702 566 481 Total                 Premiums and                 Fees $ 1,526 $ 1,243 $ 1,026 Principal       Products and Markets Life,       Accident and Supplemental Health Insurance CIGNA       Internationals life, accident and supplemental health insurance products       generally provide simple, affordable coverage of risks for the health and       financial security of individuals. These products       are marketed primarily through distribution partners with whom the individual       has an affinity relationship. Supplemental health products provide a specified       payment for a variety of health risks and include personal accident, accidental       death, critical illness, hospitalization, cancer and other dread disease       coverages. CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health       insurance operations are located in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand,       Indonesia, Peoples Republic of China, Thailand, the European Union, and Chile.       In the third quarter of 2006, CIGNA entered into negotiations to sell its       Brazilian life insurance business which is in run-off. The sale is expected       to       close in 2007.
International       Health Care Benefits CIGNA       Internationals health care operations primarily consist of an array of products       and services to meet the needs of multinational companies and their expatriate       employees and dependents. These expatriate benefits include medical, dental,       vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability products, as       well as primary medical and dental benefits for international business travelers       and expatriates. The customers of CIGNA Internationals expatriate benefits       business are multinational companies headquartered in the United States, Canada,       Europe and the Middle East. The expatriate benefits products and services are       offered through guaranteed cost, experience-rated, administrative services       only,       and minimum premium funding arrangements. For definitions of guaranteed cost,       experience-rated, and administrative services only funding arrangements, see       Funding Arrangements in Section C on page       10 .
CIGNA       Internationals health care operations also include medical and some life       insurance products, which are provided through group benefits programs in the       UK, Spain, Chile and Guatemala. These products are primarily medical indemnity       insurance coverage, with some offerings having managed care or administrative       service aspects. These products generally provide an alternative or supplement       to government programs.
15 Distribution CIGNA       Internationals life, accident and supplemental health insurance products are       distributed primarily through direct marketing channels, such as outbound       telemarketing, in-branch bancassurance, and direct response television.       Marketing campaigns are conducted through these channels under a variety of       arrangements with affinity partners. These affinity partners include banks,       credit card companies and other financial institutions.
CIGNA       Internationals health care products are distributed through independent brokers       and consultants as well as CIGNA Internationals own sales       personnel.
Pricing,       Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums       for CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health insurance       products are based on assumptions about mortality, morbidity, persistency,       expenses and target profit margins, as well as interest rates. The profitability       of these products is affected by the degree to which future experience deviates       from these assumptions.
Fees       for       variable universal life insurance products consist of mortality, administrative,       asset management and surrender charges assessed against the contractholders       fund balance. Mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted       prospectively to reflect expected mortality experience.
Premiums       and fees for CIGNA Internationals health care products reflect assumptions       about future claims, expenses, investment returns, and profit margins. For       products using networks of contracted providers, premiums reflect assumptions       about the impact of provider contracts and utilization management on future       claims. Most of the premium volume for the medical indemnity business is on       a       guaranteed cost basis. Other premiums are established on an experience-rated       basis. Most contracts permit rate changes at least annually.
The       profitability of health care products is dependent upon the accuracy of       projections for health care inflation (unit cost and utilization), the adequacy       of fees charged for administration and risk assumption and, in the case of       managed care products, effective medical cost management.
In       addition to paying current benefits and expenses, CIGNA International       establishes reserves in amounts estimated to be sufficient to settle reported       claims not yet paid, as well as claims incurred but not yet       reported.
Additionally, for some individual life insurance and supplemental health       insurance products CIGNA International establishes policy reserves which reflect       the present value of expected future obligations less the present value of       expected future premiums.
CIGNA       International defers acquisition costs incurred in the sales of long-duration       life, accident and supplemental health products. These costs are amortized       in       proportion to premium revenue recognized, except that those incurred in relation       to sales of variable universal life products are amortized in proportion to       expected gross profits.
CIGNA       International reduces its exposure to large and/or multiple losses arising       out       of a single occurrence by purchasing reinsurance from unaffiliated       reinsurers.
Competition Competitive       factors in CIGNA Internationals life, accident and supplemental health       operations include product innovation and differentiation, efficient management       of the direct marketing process, commission levels paid to distribution       partners, and quality of claims and policyholder services.
The       principal competitive factors that affect CIGNA Internationals health care       operations are underwriting and pricing, relative operating efficiency, relative       effectiveness in medical cost management, product innovation and       differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of claims and policyholder       services. In most overseas markets, perception of financial strength is also       an       important competitive factor.
For       the       life, accident and supplemental health insurance line of business, locally       based       competitors are primarily indigenous insurance companies, including insurance       subsidiaries of banks. However, insurance company competitors in this segment       primarily focus on traditional product distribution, with direct marketing       being       a secondary objective.
16 For       the       expatriate benefits business, CIGNA Internationals primary competitors include       U.S.-based and European health insurance companies with global expatriate       benefits operations. For the health care operations in the UK, Spain, Chile       and       Guatemala, the primary competitors are regional and local insurers.
CIGNA       International expects that the competitive environment will intensify as U.S.       and Europe-based insurance and financial services providers pursue global       expansion opportunities.
CIGNA       International conducts some of its international health care benefits operations       and all of its life, accident and supplemental health insurance operations       through foreign operating entities which maintain assets and liabilities in       local currencies. This reduces the exposure to economic loss resulting from       unfavorable exchange rate movements. For information on the effect of foreign       exchange exposure, see Market Risk in the MD&A section, and Note 2R to       CIGNAs 2006 Financial Statements included inCIGNA's 2006 Annual       Report.
CIGNA       Internationals health care benefits products and life, accident and       supplemental health insurance products include coverage for employees and       individuals who may be exposed to acts of terrorism, the events of a war zone       or       natural disasters.
South       Korea represents the single largest geographic market for CIGNA Internationals       businesses. In 2006, South Korea generated 29% of CIGNA Internationals revenues       and 41% of its segment earnings. CIGNA Internationals business in South Korea       would be vulnerable to adverse consumer credit conditions in that country.       In       addition, geopolitical and economic events in South Korea could have a       significant impact on CIGNA International as well as on CIGNA's consolidated       results.
17 F.
Other       Operations Other       Operations consists of:  deferred                 gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance                 and                 annuity business;  corporate                 life insurance (including policies on which loans are outstanding);                 and  settlement                 annuity business.
The       products and services related to these operations are offered by subsidiaries       of       CIGNA Corporation.
CIGNA       sold its individual life insurance and annuity business in 1998. A portion       of       the gain was deferred because the principal agreement to sell this business       was       an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. The deferred portion is being recognized       at the rate that earnings from the sold business would have been expected to       emerge, primarily over 15 years on a declining basis. Because it was an       indemnity reinsurance transaction, CIGNA is not relieved of primary liability       for the reinsured business.
CIGNA       sold its retirement business in 2004, but retained the corporate life insurance       business previously reported in that segment. Corporate life insurance products       are permanent life insurance contracts sold to corporations to provide coverage       on the lives of certain of their employees. Permanent life insurance, which       is       non-participating, provides coverage that when adequately funded does not expire       after a term of years and builds a cash value that may equal the full policy       amount if the insured is alive on the policy maturity date. Non-participating       insurance does not pay dividends, but deviations from assumed experience may       be       reflected in future policy values.
Corporate       life insurance products include universal life and variable universal life.
Universal       life policies typically provide flexible coverage and flexible premium payments.       Universal life cash values fluctuate with the amount of the premiums paid,       mortality and expense charges made, and interest credited to the policy.       Variable universal life policies are universal life contracts where the cash       values vary directly with the performance of the investments underlying the       policy.
Interest       is credited on most nonvariable universal life products at a declared rate       equal       to or above a minimum guaranteed rate. Credited interest rates vary with the       characteristics of each product and the anticipated investment results of the       assets backing these products. Where the credited interest rate exceeds the       guaranteed rate, the excess is used to purchase additional insurance or increase       cash values. Credited interest rates on these products for 2006 ranged from       3.19% to 5.30%, with a weighted average rate of 4.40%, compared with a range       from 2.33% to 5.44% and a weighted average of 4.61% for 2005.
In       lieu       of credited interest rates, holders of certain nonvariable universal life       contracts may select the option of receiving credited income based on changes       in       an equity index, such as the S&P 500  .       No such       elections have been made since 2004. If such an equity index is used, CIGNA       may       purchase derivative options to minimize the effect of the income credited for       such contracts.
Federal       legislation enacted in 1996 eliminated the tax deduction for policy loan       interest for most leveraged corporate life insurance products. There have been       no sales of this product since 1997. As a result of an Internal Revenue Service       initiative to settle tax disputes regarding these products, some customers       have       surrendered their policies and management expects earnings associated with       these       products to continue to decline.
CIGNAs       settlement annuity business is a run-off block of contracts. These contracts       are       primarily liability settlements with approximately half of the payments       guaranteed and not contingent on survivorship.
18 G.
Investments       and Investment Income CIGNAs       investment operations provide investment management and related services in       the       United States primarily for CIGNAs corporate invested assets and the       insurance-related invested assets in its General Account ("Invested Assets").       CIGNA acquires or originates, directly or through intermediaries, various       investments including private placements, public securities, mortgage loans,       real estate and short-term investments. CIGNAs Invested Assets are managed       primarily by CIGNA subsidiaries and external managers with whom CIGNA's       subsidiaries contract.
Assets       Under Management CIGNAs       Invested Assets under management at December 31, 2006 totaled $18.3 billion.
As       of       December 31, 2006, CIGNA's separate account funds consisted of:  $4.6                 billion in separate account assets that are managed by the buyer                 of the                 retirement benefits business pursuant to modified coinsurance                 arrangements; and  $4.0                 billion in funds which support certain corporate owned life insurance,                 health care and disability and life products.
CIGNA       also managed, as of December 31, 2006, $96 million in customer assets for which       the customer retains title. These customer assets, together with separate       account assets managed directly by CIGNA, are referred to as Advisory Portfolio       Assets. The income, gains and losses for Advisory Portfolio Assets generally       accrue to contractholders and are not included in CIGNA's revenues and expenses,       although the assets in separate accounts and related liabilities are separately       presented on CIGNA's balance sheet.
Domestic       Employee Benefits Investments The       major       portfolios under management in CIGNAs General Account consist of the combined       assets of the Health Care, Disability and Life, Other Operations, Run-off       Retirement and Run-off       Reinsurance segments       (collectively, Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios). As of December 31, 2006       the Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios had $16.9 billion in Invested       Assets.
CIGNA       generally manages the characteristics of these assets to reflect the underlying       characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities, as well       as       regulatory and tax considerations pertaining to those liabilities. CIGNAs       domestic insurance and contractholder liabilities as of December 31, 2006,       excluding liabilities of businesses sold through use of reinsurance, were       associated with the following products: fully guaranteed annuity, 20%;       interest-sensitive life insurance, 31%; and other life and health, 49%. These       products, and the investment assets supporting them, are described       below.
Fully       guaranteed products primarily include settlement annuities. Because these       products generally do not permit withdrawal by policyholders prior to maturity,       the amount and timing of future benefit cash flows can be reasonably estimated.       Funds supporting these products are invested in fixed income investments that       generally match the aggregate duration of the investment portfolio with that       of       the related benefit cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, the duration of assets       that supported these liabilities was approximately 13 years.
Interest-sensitive       products primarily consist of corporate life insurance products. Invested assets       supporting these products are primarily fixed income investments and policy       loans. Fixed income investments emphasize investment yield while meeting the       liquidity requirements of the related liabilities.
Other       life and health insurance products consist of various group and individual       life,       health and disability insurance products and guaranteed minimum death benefits.       The supporting invested assets are structured to emphasize investment income,       and the necessary liquidity is provided through cash flow, short-term and fixed       maturity investments. Assets supporting longer-term group disability insurance       benefits and group life waiver of premium benefits are generally managed to       an       aggregate duration similar to that of the related benefit cash       flows.
19 Investment       Strategy Investment       strategy and results are affected by the amount and timing of cash available       for       investment, competition for investments (especially in private asset classes),       economic conditions, interest rates and asset allocation decisions.
CIGNA       routinely monitors and evaluates the status of its investments in light of       current economic conditions, trends in capital markets and other factors. Such       factors include industry sector considerations for fixed maturity investments,       and geographic and property-type considerations for mortgage loan and real       estate investments.
Types       of Investments CIGNA       invests in a broad range of asset classes, including domestic and international       fixed maturities and common stocks, mortgage loans, real estate and short-term       investments. Fixed maturity investments include publicly traded and private       placement corporate bonds, government bonds, publicly traded and private       placement asset-backed securities, and redeemable preferred stocks. In       connection with CIGNA's investment strategy to enhance investment yields by       selling senior participations of mortgage loans, as of December 31, 2006       mortgage loans includes $124 million of mortgage loans originated with the       intent to sell. These mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower       of       cost or market with any resulting valuation allowance reported in realized       investment gains and losses.
For       the       International portfolios, CIGNA invests primarily in publicly traded fixed       maturites, short term investments and time deposits denominated in the currency       of the relevant liabilities and surplus.
Fixed       Maturities As       of       December 31, 2006, fixed maturity investments constituted 64% of the Domestic       Employee Benefits portfolios.
CIGNA       invests primarily in investment grade fixed maturities rated by rating agencies       (for public investments) and by CIGNA (for private investments). For information       about below investment grade holdings, see Investment Assets in the MD&A       section of CIGNAs 2006 Annual Report.
Mortgages       and Real Estate Mortgage       loan investments constituted 24% of the Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios       as       of December 31, 2006. Mortgage loan investments are subject to underwriting       criteria addressing loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage, cash flow,       tenant quality, leasing, market, location and borrowers financial strength.       Such investments consist primarily of first mortgage loans on commercial       properties and are diversified by property type, location and borrower. CIGNA       invests primarily in mortgages on fully completed and substantially leased       commercial properties. Virtually all of CIGNAs mortgage loans are balloon       payment loans, under which all or a substantial portion of the loan principal       is       due at the end of the loan term.
CIGNA       enters into joint ventures with local partners to develop, lease and manage       commercial real estate to maximize investment returns. CIGNA's portfolio of       real       estate investments consist of properties under development and stabilized       properties, and are diversified relative to property type and location. CIGNA       also acquires real estate through foreclosure of mortgage loans. CIGNA       rehabilitates, re-leases and sells foreclosed properties, a process that usually       takes from two to four years unless management considers a near-term sale       preferable. Additionally, CIGNA invests in third party sponsored real estate       equity funds to maximize investment returns and to maintain diversity with       respect to its real estate related exposure. CIGNA sold $9 million of foreclosed       properties in 2006. Real estate investments were not a significant portion       of       CIGNAs Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios as of December 31, 2006, although       CIGNA realized gains of $252 million from sales of equity real estate       investments in 2006.
Derivative       Instruments CIGNA       generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize its exposure to       certain market risks. CIGNA has also written derivative instruments to minimize       insurance customers market risks. In addition, to enhance investment returns,       CIGNA may invest in indexed credit default swaps or other credit derivatives       from 20 time       to       time. For information about CIGNAs use of derivative financial instruments, see       Notes 2(B) and 10(F) to CIGNAs 2006 Financial Statements       included in its 2006 Annual Report.
See       Investment Assets in the MD&A section of, and Notes 2, 10, and 11 to the       Financial Statements included in CIGNAs 2006 Annual Report for additional       information about CIGNAs investments.
Other       Investments In       addition to the Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios, CIGNA has a portfolio       that primarily includes the investments of the International segment.
The       investment portfolios under management in the International segment contain       assets backing the liabilities and surplus of subsidiaries operating in the       countries and territories where CIGNA International has business presence.       Collectively, these are referred to as the International portfolios. As of       December 31, 2006 the International portfolios had $1.4 billion in Invested       Assets. The International portfolios are primarily managed by external managers       with whom CIGNA's subsidiaries contract.
The       characteristics of these assets are generally managed to reflect the underlying       characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities, as well       as       regulatory and tax considerations in the countries where CIGNA's subsidiaries       operate. Assets are generally invested in the currency of related liabilities,       typically the currency in which the subsidiaries operate. CIGNA's investment       policy allows the investment of subsidiary assets in U.S. dollars to the extent       permitted by regulation. CIGNA's international invested assets as of December       31, 2006 were held in support of statutory surplus and liabilities associated       with the following types of insurance products: Accident       and health insurance consists of various individual group and individual life,       accident and health products. The duration of related liabilities is typically       less than one year. Investment assets supporting surplus and accident and health       liabilities are structured to emphasize investment income, and the necessary       liquidity is provided through cash flow, short term and fixed maturity       investments.
Interest       sensitive products primarily consist of return of premium products in which       the nominal amount of premiums paid for a multi-year accident and health policy       are paid back to the policyholder at the end of the contract period. Invested       assets supporting these products are fixed income investments that generally       match the aggregate duration of the investment portfolio with that of the       related benefit cash flows.
Unit       linked investment products are insurance contracts in which a portion of the       policyholders premium is used to purchase shares in investment funds for which       the policyholder bears the investment risk and return.
Fully       guaranteed products primarily include single premium immediate annuities.       Because these products have defined payment obligations to policyholders, the       amount and timing of future benefit cash flows can be reasonably estimated.       Funds supporting these products are invested in fixed income investments that       to       the extent possible match the cash flows of the investment portfolio with the       benefit cash flows.

Run-off       Retirement On       April       1, 2004, CIGNA sold its retirement benefits businesses. CIGNA no longer sells       the products related to the sold businesses. For additional information about       the sale transaction, see Sale of Retirement Benefits Business in the MD&A       section, and Note 3 to CIGNAs 2006 Financial Statements included in its 2006       Annual Report.
The       sale       of CIGNA's retirement benefits business was primarily in the form of a       reinsurance arrangement. Upon the sale, CIGNA reinsured with the buyer of the       retirement business $16.0 billion of general account contractholder liabilities       under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement and $35.3 billion of insurance,       contractholder and separate account liabilities under modified coinsurance       arrangements, including $32.0 billion in separate account liabilities and $2.0       billion related to the single premium annuity business described       below.
Since       the       sale in 2004, the buyer of the retirement business has entered into agreements       with most of the insured party contractholders relieving CIGNA of any remaining       contractual obligations to those parties (novation agreements). As a result,       CIGNA reduced reinsurance recoverables, contractholder deposit funds, and       separate account balances for these obligations.
Single       Premium Annuity Business The       single premium annuity business consists primarily of single premium annuities       that were supported by CIGNA's general account. Initially, this business was       reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis for the first two years following       the       sale.
Effective       April 1, 2006, the buyer converted this modified coinsurance arrangement to       an       indemnity reinsurance structure and took ownership of the assets. CIGNA       transferred invested assets to the buyer and recorded a reinsurance recoverable       of approximately $1.6 billion, which corresponds to the liabilities for the       single premium annuity business held by CIGNA as of March 31, 2006.
Ceded       Business Trust The       buyer       deposited assets associated with the reinsurance of general account contracts       into a trust (the "Ceded Business Trust") and assets associated with the single       premium annuity business into a second trust (the Guaranteed Cost Trust),       which both provide security to CIGNA for the related reinsurance recoverables.       The buyer is permitted to withdraw assets from the Ceded Business Trust or       the       Guaranteed Cost Trust equal to the reduction in CIGNA's reserves whenever a       reduction occurs. For example, reductions will occur when the buyer enters       into       additional novation agreements and directly assumes liability to the insured       party. As of December 31, 2006, assets totaling $3.9 billion remained in the       combined Ceded Business Trust and Guaranteed Cost Trust.
22 I.
Run-off       Reinsurance Principal       Products and Markets Until       June 2000, CIGNA offered reinsurance coverage for part or all of the risks       written by other insurance companies under life and annuity policies (both       group       and individual); accident policies (personal accident, catastrophe and workers       compensation coverages); and health policies. These products were sold       principally in North America and Europe through a small sales force and through       intermediaries.
In       2000,       CIGNA sold its U.S. individual life, group life and accidental death reinsurance       business. CIGNA placed its remaining reinsurance businesses (including its       accident, domestic health, international life and health, and annuity       reinsurance businesses) into run-off as of June 1, 2000, and stopped       underwriting new reinsurance business.
For       the       run-off reinsurance business, CIGNA has established policy reserves that reflect       the present value of expected future obligations less the present value of       expected premiums. In addition, CIGNA establishes loss reserves for claims       received, but not yet paid based on the amount of the claim received, and for       losses incurred but not reported based on prior claim experience and other       relevant factors.
CIGNA's       reserves for reinsurance risks assumed by CIGNA and for amounts recoverable       from       its retrocessionaires are considered appropriate as of December 31, 2006 based       on current information. However, it is possible that future developments could       have a material adverse effect on CIGNA's consolidated results of operations,       and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on CIGNA's       financial condition. CIGNA bears the risk of loss if its payment obligations       to       cedents increase or if its retrocessionaires are unable to meet, or successfully       challenge, their reinsurance obligations to CIGNA.
Guaranteed       Minimum Death Benefit Contracts CIGNAs       reinsurance operations reinsured guaranteed minimum death benefits under certain       variable annuities issued by other insurance companies. These variable annuities       are essentially investments in mutual funds combined with a death benefit.       CIGNA       has equity and other market exposures as a result of this product.
For       additional information about guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts, see       Other Matters under Run-off Reinsurance in the MD&A section of, and Note       7 to CIGNA's 2006 Financial Statements included in its 2006 Annual Report.
Guaranteed       Minimum Income Benefit Contracts CIGNAs       reinsurance operations also reinsured minimum income benefits under certain       variable annuities issued by other insurance companies. When annuitants elect       to       receive these minimum income benefits, CIGNA may be required to make payments       based on changes in underlying mutual fund values and interest rates. CIGNA       purchased retrocessional reinsurance which covers 55% of the exposures on these       contracts.
For       additional information about guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts, see       Other Matters under Run-off Reinsurance and Guaranteed minimum income       benefit contracts under Guarantees and Contractual Obligations in the       MD&A section of, and Note 20C to CIGNA's 2006 Financial Statements included       in its 2006 Annual Report.
Workers       Compensation and Personal Accident CIGNA       reinsured workers compensation and other personal accident business in the       United States and in the London market. This included participation in a workers       compensation reinsurance pool formerly managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. CIGNA       purchased extensive retrocessional reinsurance for the Unicover contracts       (through the pool) and also purchased retrocessional coverage for its other       workers compensation and personal accident assumed risks. Although CIGNA is       involved in certain retrocessional enforcement arbitrations, most of the       disputes concerning retrocessional contracts have been resolved. For more       information regarding these disputes, see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages 37 and 38 .
CIGNA's       payment obligations under these workers compensation and personal accident       contracts are based on ceding companies claim payments relating to accidents       and injuries.
23 These       claim payments can in some cases extend many years into the future, and the       amount of the       ceding companies ultimate claims, and therefore the amount of CIGNA's ultimate       payment obligations and ultimate collections from its retrocessionaires, may       not       be known with certainty for some time. For more information s ee       Run-off Reinsurance in the MD&A section of, and Note 8 to CIGNA's 2006       Financial Statements included in, CIGNAs 2006 Annual Report.
24 J.
Regulation CIGNA       and       its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and international regulations       and       CIGNA has established policies and procedures to comply with applicable       requirements.
CIGNA's       insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which       they conduct business. These subsidiaries are subject to numerous state and       federal regulations related to their business operations, including, but not       limited to:  the                 form and content of customer contracts including benefit mandates                 (including special requirements for small groups of generally under                 50                 employees);  premium                 rates;  the                 content of agreements with participating providers of covered                 services;  producer                 appointment and compensation;  claims                 processing and appeals;  solvency                 requirements;  underwriting                 practices;  reinsurance                 arrangements;  advertising                 practices;  unfair                 trade and claim practices;  delegation                 of administrative functions;  risk                 sharing arrangements with                 providers;  use                 and disclosure of individuals identifiable information;                 and  operation                 of consumer-driven plans (including health savings accounts, health                 reimbursement accounts and flexible spending                 accounts).
CIGNA       also complies with regulations in international jurisdictions where foreign       insurers are, in many countries, faced with greater restrictions than their       domestic competitors. These restrictions may include discriminatory licensing       procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, required localization of records       and funds, higher premium and income taxes, and requirements for local       participation in an insurers ownership.
Other       types of regulatory oversight are described below.
Financial       Reporting Regulators       closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and       HMOs. States regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements       and       the type and concentration of permitted investments. CIGNA's insurance and       HMO       subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports with regulators       in       most of the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their operations and       accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at regular       intervals.
Guaranty       Associations, Indemnity Funds, Risk Pools and Administrative       Funds Most       states and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions require insurance companies to support       guaranty associations or indemnity funds, which are established to pay claims       on       behalf of insolvent insurance companies. In the United States, these       associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state       to pay such claims.
Several       states also require HMOs to participate in guaranty funds, special risk pools       and administrative funds. For additional information about guaranty fund and       other assessments, see Note 20 to CIGNAs 2006 Financial Statements included in       its 2006 Annual Report.
Some       states also require health insurers and HMOs to participate in assigned risk       plans, joint underwriting authorities, pools or other residual market mechanisms       to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards.
Solvency       and Capital Requirements Many       states have adopted some form of the National Association of Insurance       Commissioners (NAIC) model solvency-related laws and risk-based capital rules       (RBC rules) for life and health insurance companies. The RBC rules recommend a       minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments       held,       the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred. If the       ratio of the insurers adjusted surplus to its risk-based capital falls below       statutory required minimums, the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions       ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship.
25 In       addition, various non-U.S. jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements       that are based upon solvency, liquidity and reserve coverage measures. During       2006, CIGNAs HMOs and life and health insurance subsidiaries, as well as       non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, were compliant with applicable RBC and non-U.S.       surplus rules. The NAIC is considering changing statutory reserving rules for       variable annuities. Any changes would apply to CIGNA's reinsurance contracts       covering guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income       benefits, and would impact CIGNA's overall surplus level.
Holding       Company Laws CIGNA's       domestic insurance companies and certain of its HMOs are subject to state laws       regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies. Under such laws, certain       dividends, distributions and other transactions between an insurance or HMO       subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to, or approval by,       one       or more state insurance commissioners.
Oversight       of Marketing, Advertising and Broker Compensation State       and/or federal regulatory scrutiny of life and health insurance company and       HMO       marketing and advertising practices, including the adequacy of disclosure       regarding products and their administration, may result in increased regulation.       Products offering limited benefits, such as those issued in connection with       the       Star-HRG business acquired in 2006, may attract increased regulatory scrutiny.       States have responded to concerns about the marketing, advertising and       administration of insurance and HMO products and administrative practices by       increasing the number and frequency of market conduct examinations and imposing       larger penalties for violations of applicable laws and regulations.
In       recent       years, perceived abuses in broker compensation practices have been the focus       of       greatly heightened regulatory scrutiny. This increased regulatory focus may       lead       to legislative or regulatory changes that would affect the manner in which       CIGNA       and its competitors compensate brokers. For more information regarding general       governmental inquiries relating to CIGNA companies, see Legal Proceedings in       Item 3 on pages 37 and 38 .
Claim       Administration, Utilization Review and Related Services CIGNA       subsidiaries contract for the provision of claim administration, utilization       management and other related services with respect to the administration of       self-insured benefit plans. These CIGNA subsidiaries are subject to state       licensing requirements and regulation.
Employment       Retirement Income Security Act CIGNA       sells most of its products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans       that are governed by the federal Employment Retirement Income Security Act       (ERISA). CIGNA companies may be subject to requirements imposed by ERISA on       plan fiduciaries and parties in interest, including regulations affecting claim       and appeals procedures for health, dental, disability, life and accident plans.
Federal       Regulations Medicare       Regulations.
Several       CIGNA subsidiaries engage in businesses that are subject to federal Medicare       regulations such as:  those                 offering individual and group Medicare Advantage (HMO) coverage in                 Arizona;  contractual                 arrangements with the federal government for the processing of certain                 Medicare claims and other administrative                 services;  contractual                 arrangements with the federal government to provide disease management                 services to chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries in the state of                 Georgia; and  those                 offering Medicare Pharmacy (Part D) products that are subject to                 federal                 Medicare regulations.
Federal       Audits Participation       in government sponsored health care programs subjects CIGNA to a variety of       federal laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under       the programs (which may occur in years subsequent to provision by CIGNA of       the       relevant services under audit). These risks may include reimbursement claims       as       well as potential fines and penalties. For example, the       federal government requires Medicare and Medicaid providers to file detailed       cost reports for health care services provided. These reports may be audited       in 26 subsequent       years.
CIGNA       HMOs that contract to provide community-rated coverage to participants in the       federal Employees Health Benefit Plan may be required to reimburse the federal       government if, following an audit, it is determined that a federal employee       group did not receive the benefit of a discount offered by a CIGNA HMO to one       of       the two groups closest in size to the federal employee group. See Health Care in Section C beginning on page 4 for additional       information about CIGNAs participation in government health-related       programs.
Privacy       and Information Disclosure and Portability Regulations The       Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes       requirements for guaranteed issuance (for groups with 50 or fewer lives),       electronic data security standards, and renewal and portability, on health       care       insurers and HMOs. In addition, HIPAA regulations require the assignment of       a       unique national identifier for providers by May, 2007. The federal government       and states (as well as an increasing number of non-U.S. jurisdictions) impose       requirements regarding the use and disclosure of identifiable information about       individuals and, in an effort to deal with the growing threat of identity theft,       the handling of privacy and security incidents.
Antitrust       Regulations CIGNA       companies are also engaged in activities that may be scrutinized under federal       and state antitrust laws and regulations. These activities include the       administration of strategic alliances with competitors, information sharing       with       competitors and provider contracting.
Anti-Money       Laundering Regulations Certain       CIGNA lines of business are subject to United States Department of the Treasury       anti-money laundering regulations. Those lines of business have implemented       anti-money laundering policies designed to insure their affected products comply       with the regulations.
Investment-Related       Regulations Depending       upon their nature, CIGNA's investment management activities are subject to       U.S.       federal securities laws, ERISA, and other federal and state laws governing       investment related activities. In many cases, the investment management       activities and investments of individual insurance companies are subject to       regulation by multiple jurisdictions.
Legislative       and Regulatory Developments The       business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs, particularly       health care programs, is heavily regulated by federal and state laws and       administrative agencies, such as state departments of insurance and the federal       Departments of Labor and Justice, as well as the courts. In the growing area       of       consumer-driven plans, health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts       are also regulated by the United States Department of the Treasury and the       Internal Revenue Service. See Regulatory and Industry Developments in the       MD&A section of CIGNAs 2006 Annual Report for additional       information.
Federal       regulation and legislation may affect CIGNAs operations in a variety of ways.       In addition to proposals discussed above related to increased regulation of       the       health care industry, other proposed federal measures that may significantly       affect CIGNAs operations include calls for universal health care coverage,       market reforms achieved through state and federal legislation, modifications       of       the Medicare program, and employee       benefit regulation including modification to the tax treatment of employee       benefits.
The       economic and competitive effects of the legislative and regulatory proposals       discussed above on CIGNAs business operations will depend upon the final form       of any such legislation or regulation.

Ratings CIGNA       and       certain of its insurance subsidiaries are rated by nationally recognized rating       agencies. The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.       However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the       opinion of the rating agency, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt       or       payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the       weakest capacity.
Insurance       ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength       of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies.       The       principal agencies that rate CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries characterize their       insurance rating scales as follows:  A.M.         Best         Company, Inc. (A.M. Best), A++ to S (Superior to Suspended);  Moodys         Investors Service (Moodys), Aaa to C (Exceptional to Lowest);  Standard         & Poors Corp. (S&P), AAA to R (Extremely Strong to Regulatory         Action); and  Fitch,         Inc. (Fitch), AAA to D (Exceptionally Strong to Order of         Liquidation).
As       of       February 26, 2007, the insurance financial strength ratings for CG Life were       as       follows: CG                   Life Insurance                   Ratings ( 1 ) A.M.                   Best A (Excellent, 3 rd of                   16) Moodys A2 (Good, 6 th of                   21) S&P A- (Strong, 7 th of                   21) Fitch A (Strong, 6 th of                   24) _______________ ( 1 ) Includes                 the rating assigned, the agencys characterization of the rating and the                 position of the rating in the agencys rating scale (e.g., CG Lifes                 rating by A.M. Best is the 3rd highest rating awarded in its scale                 of                 16).
As       of       February 26, 2007, the insurance financial strength rating for Life Insurance       Company of North America assigned by A.M. Best was A (Excellent, 3 rd of 16),       and by Moodys was A2 (Good, 6 th of 21).
Debt       ratings are assessments of the likelihood that a company will make timely       payments of principal and interest. The principal agencies that rate CIGNAs       senior debt characterize their rating scales as follows:  Moodys,                 Aaa to C (Exceptional to Lowest);  S&P,                 AAA to D (Extremely Strong to Default);                 and  Fitch,                 AAA to D (Highest to Default).
The       commercial paper rating scales for those agencies are as follows:  Moodys,                 Prime-1 to Not Prime (Superior to Not                 Prime);  S&P,                 A-1+ to D (Extremely Strong to Default);                 and  Fitch,                 F-1+ to D (Very Strong to Distressed).
28 As       of       February 26, 2007, the debt ratings assigned by the following agencies were       as       follows: Debt       Ratings ( 1 ) CIGNA       CORPORATION Commercial Senior                 Debt Paper Moodys Baa2 P2 (Adequate, (Strong, 9 th of                 21) 2 nd of                 4) S&P BBB A2 ( Adequate,  ( Good , 9 th of                 22 ) 3 rd of                 7 ) Fitch BBB F2 ( Good , 9 th of                 24 ) ( Moderately                 Strong , 3 rd of                 7 ) ________________________ ( 1 ) Includes       the rating assigned, the agencys characterization of the rating and the       position of the rating in the applicable agencys rating scale.
In       December 2006, A.M. Best upgraded the financial strength ratings of certain       CIGNA subsidiaries to A from A- and revised the outlook to Stable from Positive. In February 2007, Moody's upgraded CIGNA Coproration's senior debt       rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and upgraded the financial strength ratings       ofCG Life and LINAto A2 from A3. At the same time, Moody's       upgraded the commercial paper rating to P2 from P3 and changed       theoutlook tostable from positive. CIGNA is committed to maintaining       appropriate levels of capital in its subsidiaries to support ratings of CIGNA       that meet customers expectations, and to improving the earnings of the health       care business. Lower ratings at the parent company level increase the cost       to       borrow funds. Lower ratings of CG Life could adversely affect new sales and       retention of current business.

Miscellaneous Portions       of CIGNAs insurance business are seasonal in nature. Reported claims under       group health products are generally higher in the first quarter.
CIGNA       and       its principal subsidiaries are not dependent on business from one or a few       customers. No customer accounted for 10% or more of CIGNAs consolidated       revenues in 2006. CIGNA and its principal subsidiaries are not dependent on       business from one or a few brokers or agents. In addition, CIGNAs insurance       businesses are generally not committed to accept a fixed portion of the business       submitted by independent brokers and agents, and generally all such business       is       subject to its approval and acceptance.
CIGNA       had       approximately 27,100, 28,000, and 28,600 employees as of December 31, 2006,       2005       and 2004, respectively.
30 Item       1A.
RISK       FACTORS CIGNAs       businesses face risks and       uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report.       These factors represent risks and uncertainties that could have a material       adverse effect on CIGNAs business, results of operations and financial       condition. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones CIGNA faces.       Others that CIGNA does not know about now, or that the Company does not now       think are significant, may impair its business or the trading price of its       securities. The following are significant risks identified by CIGNA.
If       CIGNA does not execute on its strategic initiatives, there could be a material       adverse effect on CIGNAs results of operations and in certain situations,       CIGNA's financial condition .
The       future performance of CIGNAs business will depend in large part on CIGNAs       ability to execute effectively and implement its strategic initiatives. These       initiatives include: executing CIGNA's consumerism strategy, including designing       products to meet emerging market trends and ensuring that an appropriate       infrastructure is in place to meet the needs of customers and members;       continuing to reduce medical costs; growing its individual and small business       market and emerging market and further penetration of the specialty markets;       and       further improving the efficiency of operations, including lowering operating       costs and enabling higher value services.
Successful       execution of these initiatives depends on a number of factors including:  the                 ability to gain and retain customers and members by providing appropriate                 levels of support and service for CIGNAs products, as well as avoiding                 service and health advocacy related                 errors;  the                 ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;  the                 negotiation of favorable provider                 contracts;  CIGNA's                   ability to develop and introduce new products or programs, because                   of the                   inherent risks and uncertainties associated with product development,                   particularly in response to government regulation or the increased                   focus                   on consumer directed products;  the                 identification and introduction of the proper mix or integration                 of                 products that will be accepted by the marketplace; and  the                 ability of CIGNAs products and services to differentiate CIGNA from its                 competitors and for CIGNA to demonstrate that these products and                 services                 (such as disease management and health advocacy programs, provider                 credentialing and other quality care initiatives) result in improved                 health outcomes and reduced costs.
Further,       CIGNAs success will depend upon its ability to develop new systems and enhance       the performance of its existing procedures and processes to adequately support       CIGNA's operations, strategies and business objectives.
If       CIGNA fails to properly maintain the integrity or security of its data or to       strategically implement new information systems, there could be a material       adverse effect on CIGNAs business.
CIGNAs       business depends on effective information systems and the integrity and       timeliness of the data it uses to run its business. CIGNAs business strategy       requires providing members and providers with internet or e-business related       products and information to meet their needs. CIGNAs ability to adequately       price its products and services, establish reserves, provide effective and       efficient service to its customers, and to timely and accurately report its       financial results also depends significantly on the integrity of the data in       its       information systems. If the information CIGNA relies upon to run its businesses       were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if CIGNA were to fail to maintain       effectively its information systems and data integrity, the Company could have       problems with, among other things: operational disruptions; determining medical       cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; customers, physicians       and       other health care providers; regulators; increases in operating expenses; and       retention and attraction of customers.
If       CIGNA       were unable to maintain the security of any sensitive data residing on the       Companys systems whether due to our own actions or those of any vendors, our       reputation would be adversely affected and we could be exposed to litigation       or       other actions, fines or penalties, any of which could adversely affect our       business or financial condition.
CIGNA       requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect       and       enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing       changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory       standards, and changing customer preferences. There can be no assurance that       CIGNAs process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support       its operations, integrating new systems and improving service levels will not       be       delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future.
31 If       premiums are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered       to       members, or if CIGNAs estimates of medical claim reserves for its guaranteed       cost and experience-rated businesses based upon estimates of future medical       claims are inadequate, profitability could decline.
CIGNAs       profitability depends, in part, on its ability to accurately predict and control       future health care costs through underwriting criteria, provider contracting,       utilization management and product design. Premiums in the health benefits       business are generally fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, future cost       increases in excess of medical cost projections reflected in pricing cannot       generally be recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. Although       CIGNA bases the premiums it charges on its estimate of future health care costs       over the fixed premium period, actual costs may exceed what was estimated and       reflected in premiums. Factors that may cause actual costs to exceed premiums       include: medical cost inflation; the introduction of new or costly treatments       and technology; and membership mix.
CIGNA       records medical claims reserves for estimated future payments. The Company       continually reviews estimates of future payments relating to medical claims       costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and makes necessary       adjustments to its reserves. However, actual health care costs may exceed what       was estimated.
If       CIGNA fails to manage successfully its outsourcing projects and key vendors,       CIGNAs financial results could be harmed .
CIGNA       takes steps to monitor and regulate the performance of independent third parties       who provide services or to whom the Company delegates selected functions. These       third parties include information technology system providers, independent       practice associations and specialty service providers.
For       instance, in 2006, CIGNA entered into an agreement with IBM to operate       significant portions of its information technology infrastructure, including       the       provision of services relating to its call center application, enterprise       content management, risk-based capital analytical infrastructure and voice       and       data communications and network in addition to the software applications and       human resource operations support IBM had previously provided pursuant to       several smaller contracts. The 2006 contract with IBM includes several service       level agreements, or SLAs, related to issues such as performance and job       disruption with significant financial penalties if these SLAs       are       not met. However, the Company may not be adequately indemnified against all       possible losses through the terms and conditions of the agreement. In addition,       some of CIGNAs termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee, which       may be significant. If CIGNA's relationship with IBM is terminated, the Company       may experience disruption of service to customers, which could affect CIGNA's       business, financial condition, and results of operations.
These       arrangements with key vendors may make CIGNAs operations vulnerable if those       third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to the Company, due to CIGNAs       failure to adequately monitor and regulate their performance, changes in their       own operations, financial condition, or other matters outside of CIGNAs       control. In recent years, certain third parties to whom CIGNA delegated selected       functions, such as specialty services providers, have experienced legal and       other difficulties, which may subject CIGNA to adverse publicity, increased       costs, decline in quality of service and potential network disruptions, and       in       some cases cause the Company to incur increased claims expense. Certain       legislative authorities have in recent periods discussed or proposed legislation       that would restrict outsourcing and, if enacted, could materially increase       CIGNAs costs. Further, CIGNA may not fully realize on a timely basis the       anticipated economic and other benefits of the outsourcing projects or other       relationships it enters into with key vendors which could result in substantial       costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact       the       Companys financial results.
A       downgrade in the financial strength ratings of CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries       could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a       downgrade in CIGNA's debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds.
Financial       strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating       organizations are an important factor in establishing the competitive position       of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Ratings information by       nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally       used throughout the industry. CIGNA believes the claims paying ability and       financial strength ratings of its principal insurance subsidiaries are an       important factor in marketing its products to certain of CIGNAs customers. In       addition, CIGNA Corporations debt ratings impact both the cost and availability       of future borrowings, and accordingly, its cost of capital. Each of the rating       agencies reviews CIGNAs ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that       current ratings will be maintained in 32 the       future. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult       to raise capital and to support business growth at CIGNAs insurance       subsidiaries.
As       of       February 26, 2007, the insurance financial strength ratings for CG Life, the       Companys principal insurance subsidiary, were as follows: CG                 Life Insurance                 Ratings ( 1 ) A.M.                 Best A (Excellent, 3 rd of                 16) Moodys A2 (Good, 6 th of                 21) S&P A- (Strong, 7 th of                 21) Fitch A (Strong, 6 th of                 24) ___________ ( 1 )       Includes the rating assigned, the agencys       characterization of the rating and the position of the rating in the agencys       rating scale (e.g., CG Lifes rating by A.M. Best is the 3rd highest awarded in       its scale of 16).
A       description of CIGNA Corporation ratings, other subsidiary ratings, as well       as       more information on these ratings, is included in Ratings in Section K       beginning on page 28 .
Unfavorable       claims experience related to workers compensation and personal accident       insurance exposures in CIGNAs Run-off Reinsurance business could result in       losses .
Unfavorable       claims experience related to workers compensation and personal accident       insurance exposures in CIGNAs run-off reinsurance business is possible and       could result in future losses. Further, CIGNA could have losses attributable       to       its inability to recover amounts from retrocessionaires or ceding companies       either due to disputes with the retrocessionaires or ceding companies or their       financial condition. If CIGNAs reserves for amounts recoverable from       retrocessionaires or ceding companies, as well as reserves associated with       underlying reinsurance exposures are insufficient, it could result in       losses.
If       CIGNAs program for its guaranteed minimum death benefits contracts fails to       reduce the risk of stock market declines, it could have a material adverse       effect on the Companys financial condition.
As       part       of its run-off reinsurance business, CIGNA reinsured a guaranteed minimum death       benefit under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.       CIGNA adopted a program to reduce equity market risks related to these contracts       by selling domestic and foreign-denominated exchange-traded futures contracts       and foreign currency forward contracts. The purpose of this program is to reduce       the adverse effects of potential future domestic and international stock market       declines on CIGNAs liabilities for these contracts. Under the program,       increases in liabilities under the annuity contracts from a declining market       are       offset by gains on the futures contracts. However, if CIGNA were to have       difficulty in entering into appropriate futures or forward contracts, or stock       market declines expose CIGNA to higher rates of partial       surrender (which are not covered by the program), there could be a material       adverse effect on the Companys financial condition. See Run-off Reinsurance in Section I on page 23 for more information       on the       program.
If       actual experience differs significantly from CIGNAs assumptions used in       estimating CIGNAs liabilities for reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum       death benefits or minimum income benefits, it could have a material adverse       effect on CIGNAs consolidated results of operations, and in certain situations,       could have a material adverse effect on CIGNA's financial condition.
CIGNAs       management estimates reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit and minimum       income benefit exposures are based on assumptions regarding lapse, partial       surrender, mortality, interest rates, volatility, reinsurance recoverables,       and,       for minimum income benefit exposures, annuity income election rates. These       estimates are based on CIGNAs experience and future expectations. CIGNA       monitors actual experience to update these reserve estimates as necessary.       CIGNA       regularly evaluates the assumptions used in establishing reserves and changes       its estimates if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier       assumptions should be revised.
33 Significant       stock market declines could result in increased pension plan expenses and the       recognition of additional pension obligations.
CIGNA       has       a pension plan that covers a large number of current employees and retirees.       Unfavorable investment performance due to significant stock market declines       or       changes in estimates of benefit costs, if significant, could adversely affect       CIGNAs results of operations or financial condition by significantly increasing       its pension plan expenses and obligations.
Significant       changes in market interest rates affect the value of CIGNA's financial       instruments that promise a fixed return and, as such, could have an adverse       effect on CIGNA's results of operations.
As       an       insurer, CIGNA has substantial investment assets that support its policy       liabilities. Generally low levels of interest rates on investments, such as       those experienced in United States financial markets during recent years, have       negatively impacted the level of investment income earned by the Company in       recent periods, and such lower levels of investment income would continue if       these lower interest rates were to continue. Substantially all of the Companys       investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying       maturities, fixed redeemable preferred securities, mortgage loans and real       estate. The value of these securities can fluctuate significantly with changes       in market conditions.
CIGNA       faces risks related to litigation and regulatory       investigations.
CIGNA       is       routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits,       investigations and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of the       business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs, including       benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and disputes regarding       reinsurance arrangements. In addition, CIGNA incurs and likely will continue       to       incur liability for claims related to its health care business, such as failure       to pay for or provide health care, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged,       provider disputes, including disputes over compensation, and claims related       to       self-funded business. Also, there are currently, and may be in the future,       attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the industry. In addition,       CIGNA       is involved in pending and threatened litigation arising out of its run-off       reinsurance and retirement operations.
Court       decisions and legislative activity may increase CIGNAs exposure for any of       these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive       damages may be sought. CIGNA currently has insurance coverage for some of these       potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by       insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not       be       enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages,       such       as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage       for       all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively       expensive in the future.
A       description of material legal actions in which CIGNA is currently involved       is       included under Legal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages 37 and       38 , and Note 20 to CIGNAs 2006 Financial Statements included in its 2006       Annual Report. The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always       uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence can occur. CIGNA       believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it       and       is defending itself vigorously. Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution       of       one or more legal matters could result in losses material to CIGNAs       consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial       condition.
CIGNAs       business is subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with       new       regulation, could increase its costs of doing business and could adversely       affect its profitability.
CIGNAs       business is regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels.       The       laws and rules governing CIGNAs business and interpretations of those laws and       rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies       administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force       CIGNA to change how it does business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth,       increase health care, technology and administrative costs including pension       costs and capital requirements, take other actions such as changing our reserve       levels with respect to certain reinsurance contracts, and increase CIGNAs       liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract       interpretation and other actions.
CIGNA       must comply with the various regulations applicable to its business. If CIGNA       fails to comply, the Companys business could be adversely affected. In       addition, CIGNA must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many       of       its products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to       consummate some of its acquisitions and divestitures. Delays in obtaining or       failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce the Companys revenue       or increase its costs.
34 For       further information on regulatory matters relating to CIGNA, see Regulation in       Section J on page 25 and Legal Proceedings in Item 3       on pages 37 and 38 , as well as Regulatory and Industry       Developments in the MD&A section of CIGNAs 2006 Annual       Report.
CIGNA       faces competitive pressure, particularly price competition, which could reduce       product margins and constrain growth in CIGNAs health care businesses.
While       health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service quality       of       clinical resources, claims administration services and medical management       programs, and quality and sufficiency of provider networks, CIGNA expects that       price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. CIGNAs customer       contracts are subject to negotiation as customers seek to contain their costs,       and customers may elect to reduce benefits in order to constrain increases       in       their benefit costs. Such an election may result in lower premiums for the       Companys products, although it may also reduce CIGNAs costs. Alternatively,       the Companys customers may purchase different types of products from it that       are less profitable, or move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums.
In       addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the health       care industry giving rise to speculation and uncertainty regarding the status       of       companies, which potentially can affect marketing efforts and public perception.       Consolidation may make it more difficult for the Company to retain or increase       customers, to improve the terms on which CIGNA does business with its suppliers,       or to maintain its position or increase profitability. Factors such as business       consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices       create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite increasing medical       costs. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act gives banks and other financial       institutions the ability to affiliate with insurance companies, which may lead       to new competitors with significant financial resources in the insurance and       health benefits fields. If CIGNA does not compete effectively in its markets,       if       the Company sets rates too high in highly competitive markets to keep or       increase its market share, if membership does not increase as it expects, or       if       it declines, or if CIGNA loses accounts with favorable medical cost experience       while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical       cost experience, CIGNAs product margins and growth could be adversely       affected.
Public       perception of CIGNA's products and practices as well as of the health benefits       industry, if negative, could reduce enrollment in CIGNAs health benefits       programs.
The       health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can arise       either from perceptions regarding the industry or CIGNA's business practices       or       products. This risk may be increased as CIGNA offers new products, such as       products with limited benefits or an integrated line of products, targeted       at       market segments, beyond those in which CIGNA traditionally has operated.       Negative publicity may a dversely       affect the CIGNA brand and its ability to market its products and services,       which could reduce the number of enrollees in CIGNA's health benefits programs       and adversely affect CIGNAs profitability.
Large-scale       public health epidemics, bio-terrorist activity, natural disasters or other       extreme events could cause CIGNAs covered medical and disability expenses,       pharmacy costs and mortality experience to rise significantly, and in severe       circumstances, could cause operational disruption.
If       widespread public health epidemics such as an influenza pandemic, bio-terrorist       or other attack, or catastrophic natural disaster were to occur, CIGNAs covered       medical and disability expenses, pharmacy costs and mortality experience       could rise significantly, depending on the governments actions and the       responsiveness of public health agencies and insurers. In addition, depending       on       the severity of the situation, a widespread outbreak could curtail economic       activity in general, and CIGNA's operations in particular, which could result       in       operational and financial disruption to CIGNA, which among other things may       impact the timeliness of claims and revenue. CIGNAs business and financial       condition could also be adversely affected if the Company does not maintain       adequate procedures to ensure disaster recovery and business continuity for       its       facilities and operations in the event of a natural disaster.
CIGNA       faces a wide range of risks, and its success depends on its ability to identify,       prioritize and appropriately manage its enterprise risk       exposure.
As       a       large company operating in a complex industry, CIGNA encounters       a variety of risks as identified in this Risk Factor discussion.       CIGNA devotes       resources to developing enterprise-wide risk management processes, in addition       to the risk management processes within its businesses. Failure to appropriately       identify and manage these risks, as well as the failure to identify and take       advantage of 35 appropriate       opportunities, can materially affect CIGNAs profitability, its ability to       retain or grow business, or, in the event of extreme circumstances, CIGNAs       financial condition.
CIGNA       faces risks relating to its ability to effectively deploy its       capital.
CIGNAs       operations have generated significant capital in recent periods and the Company       has significant ability to raise additional capital. In deploying its capital       to       fund its investments in operations, share repurchases, potential acquisitions       or       other capital uses, CIGNA's financial results could be adversely affected if       it       does not appropriately balance its risks and opportunities.
CIGNA       is subject to potential changes in the political environment which affects       public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our       products.
While       it       is not possible to predict when and whether fundamental policy changes would       occur, these could include policy changes on the local, state and federal level       that could fundamentally change the dynamics       of CIGNAs industry, such as a much larger role of the government in the health       care arena. Changes in public policy could materially affect CIGNA's       profitability, its ability to retain or grow business, or in the event of       extreme circumstances, its financial condition.

PROPERTIES CIGNA's       headquarters, along with CIGNA Group Insurance, CIGNA International, portions       of       CIGNA HealthCare and CIGNA's staff support operations, are located in       approximately 450,000 square feet of leased office space at Two Liberty Place,       Philadelphia. CIGNA HealthCare is the primary occupant of a complex of buildings       owned by CIGNA, aggregating approximately 1.5 million square feet of office       space, located at 900-950 Cottage Grove Road, Bloomfield, Connecticut. In       addition, CIGNA owns or leases office buildings, or parts thereof, throughout       the United States and in other countries. CIGNA believes its properties are       adequate and suitable for its business as presently conducted. For additional       information concerning leases and property, see Notes 2H and 18 to CIGNA's       2006       Financial Statements included in its 2006 Annual Report.

Item       3.
LEGAL       PROCEEDINGS In       re       Managed Care Litigation On       April       7, 2000, several pending actions were consolidated in the United States District       Court for the Southern District of Florida in a multi-district litigation       proceeding captioned In       re       Managed Care Litigation .       The       consolidated cases include Shane       v. Humana, Inc., et al.
(CIGNA       subsidiaries added as defendants in August 2000), Mangieri       v. CIGNA Corporation (filed       December 7, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Northern District       of Alabama), Kaiser       and Corrigan v. CIGNA Corporation, et al.
(class       of health care providers certified on March 29, 2001) and Amer.       Dental Assn v. CIGNA Corp. et. al.
(a       putative class of dental providers).
In       2004,       the Court approved a settlement agreement between the physician class and CIGNA.       A dispute over disallowed claims under the settlement submitted by a       representative of certain class member physicians is proceeding to arbitration.       Separately, in April 2005, the Court approved a settlement between CIGNA and       a       class of non-physician health care providers. Only the Amer.       Dental Assn case       remains unresolved. CIGNA's motion to dismiss the case is pending.
In       the       fourth quarter 2006, pursuant to a settlement, CIGNA received a favorable $22       million pre-tax ($14 million after tax) insurance recovery related to this       litigation. There are two additional proceedings seeking to recover insurance       proceeds on account of this litigation. The total insurance recovery that is       being sought in the two proceedings is $20 million.
Broker       Compensation Beginning       in 2004, CIGNA, other insurance companies and certain insurance brokers received       subpoenas and inquiries from various regulators, including the New York and       Connecticut Attorneys General and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation       relating to their investigations of insurance broker compensation. CIGNA       received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of       California in October 2005 and the San Diego District Attorney in March 2006       and       is providing information to them about broker, Universal Life Resources (ULR).       In addition, in January 2006, CIGNA received a subpoena from the U.S. Department       of Labor and is providing information to that Office about another broker.       CIGNA       is cooperating with the inquiries and investigations.
On       November 18, 2004, The       People of the State of California by and through John Garamendi, Insurance       Commissioner of the State of California v. Universal Life Resources, et       al .       was       filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San       Diego alleging that defendants (including CIGNA and several other insurance       holding companies) failed to disclose compensation paid to ULR and that, in       return for the compensation, ULR steered clients to defendants. The plaintiffs       are seeking injunctive relief only. The trial is expected to begin on August       31,       2007.
On       August       1, 2005, two CIGNA subsidiaries, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company       and       Life Insurance Company of North America, were named as defendants in a       consolidated amended complaint filed in In       re       Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation ,       a       multi-district litigation proceeding consolidated in the United States District       Court for the District of New Jersey. The complaint alleges that brokers and       insurers conspired to hide commissions, increasing the cost of employee benefit       plans, and seeks treble damages and injunctive relief. Numerous insurance       brokers and other insurance companies are named as defendants.
In       re       CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation In       late       2002, several purported class action lawsuits were filed against CIGNA and       certain of its 37 officers       by individuals seeking to represent a class of purchasers of CIGNA securities       from May 2, 2001 to October 24, 2002. The complaints alleged, among other       things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of, and Rule 10b-5 under,       the       Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by misleading CIGNA shareholders with respect       to       the companys performance during the class period. In 2003, these suits were       consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of       Pennsylvania as In       re       CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation .
On       November 7, 2002, a purported shareholder derivative complaint nominally on       behalf of CIGNA was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern       District of Pennsylvania by Evelyn Hobbs. The complaint alleges breaches of       fiduciary duty by CIGNAs directors, including, among other things, their failure to monitor, investigate and oversee Cignas management information       system and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. A similar complaint, filed       on November 19, 2002 in the New Castle County (Delaware) Chancery Court by       Jack       Scott was dismissed by the plaintiff and refiled in the United States District       Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Hobbs and Scott cases       are being coordinated in the United States District Court for the Eastern       District of Pennsylvania by the same judge handling the In       re       CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation .
In       December 2006, the parties agreed to settle In       re       CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation and the Hobbs and Scott cases.       The In       re       CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation settlement, which specifies $93 million to be paid to the plaintiffs, was       preliminarily approved by the court on January 25, 2007. A final fairness       hearing before the court is expected to be held on April 27, 2007, with final       approval expected shortly thereafter. Additionally, the settlement is also       dependent upon a certain level of class participation. Also, CIGNA and its       directors have reached a separate settlement with the plaintiffs in the Hobbs and Scott cases.       Under the settlement, CIGNA's insurers will deposit and apportion, on behalf       of       the individual defendants, $6 million of the aforementioned $93 million class       action settlement, and have agreed to make a payment of not more than $720,000       for the plaintiffs attorneys fees, subject to court approval. On January 25,       2007, the court preliminarily approved the settlement and set a hearing date       on       final approval on April 27, 2007, with final approval expected shortly       thereafter.
Amara       Cash Balance Pension Plan Litigation On       December 18, 2001, Janice Amara filed a purported class action lawsuit in the       United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against CIGNA       Corporation and the CIGNA Pension Plan on behalf of herself and other similarly       situated participants in the CIGNA Pension Plan affected by the 1998 conversion       to a cash balance formula. The plaintiffs allege, various ERISA violations       including, among other things, that the Plans cash balance formula       discriminates against older employees; the conversion resulted in a wear away       period (during which the pre-conversion accrued benefit exceeded the       post-conversion benefit); and these conditions are not adequately disclosed       in       the Plan. The plaintiffs were granted class certification on December 20, 2002,       and seek equitable relief. A non-jury trial began on September 11-15, 2006.       Due       to the courts schedule, the proceedings were adjourned and then the trial was       completed on January 25, 2007. The judge has ordered the parties to submit       post-trial briefs in advance of closing arguments to be held on June 4, 2007.
Run-off       Reinsurance Litigation In       connection with CIGNA's run-off reinsurance operations, described on page 23 , CIGNA purchased extensive retrocessional       reinsurance for its Unicover contracts and also for some other segments of       its       non-Unicover business. CIGNA is appealing in court an adverse award in a       retrocessional enforcement arbitration. That appeal, captioned CIGNA       EUROPE INSURANCE COMPANY SA-NV v. John Hancock Life Insurance       Company ,       is       pending in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court,       and a hearing is scheduled for March 13-14, 2007. In addition CIGNA recently       commenced another retrocessional enforcement arbitration.
CIGNA       is       routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory and IRS audits,       investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the       ordinary course of the business of administering and insuring employee benefit       programs. An increasing number of claims are being made for substantial       non-economic, extra-contractual or punitive damages. The outcome of litigation       and other legal matters is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified       by the evidence can occur. CIGNA believes that it has valid defenses to the       legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously.       Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or more of the legal matters       currently pending or threatened could result in losses material to CIGNAs       consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial       condition.

CIGNA             may issue debt, equity or other securities from time to time, with amount,             price             and terms to be determined at the time of sale.
In             November 2006, CIGNA issued $250 million of 6.150% Senior Notes under             this             registration statement. The Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.150%             per year,             which is payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May             15, 2007.             The Notes will mature on November 15, 2036. CIGNA may redeem the Notes             at any             time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, at a specified redemption             price.

Note             4 As             of             December 31, 2006, CIGNA Corporation had guarantees and similar agreements             in             place to secure payment obligations or solvency requirements of certain             wholly             owned subsidiaries as follows:  CIGNA                       Corporation has arranged for bank letters of credit in support                       of CIGNA                       Global Reinsurance Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary                       domiciled                       in Bermuda, in the amount of $78 million. These letters of                       credit secure                       the payment of insureds claims from run-off reinsurance operations. CIGNA                       Corporation has agreed to indemnify the banks providing the                       letters of                       credit in the event of any draw. As of December 31, 2006 approximately                       $75                       million of the letters of credit are                       issued.
CIGNA                       Corporation has provided a capital commitment deed in an amount                       up to $185                       million in favor of CIGNA Global Reinsurance Company. This                       deed is equal                       to the letters of credit securing the payment of insureds claims from                       run-off reinsurance operations. This deed is required by Bermuda                       regulators to have these letters of credit for the London run-off                       reinsurance operations included as admitted                       assets.
Various                       indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries have obtained surety bonds                       in the                       normal course of business. If there is a claim on a surety                       bond and the                       subsidiary is unable to pay, CIGNA Corporation guarantees payment                       to the                       company issuing the surety bond. The aggregate amount of such                       surety bonds                       as of December 31, 2006 was $50                       million.
CIGNA                       Corporation is obligated under a $25 million letter of credit                       required by                       the insurer of its high-deductible self-insurance programs                       to indemnify                       the insurer for claim liabilities that fall within deductible                       amounts for                       policy years dating back to 1994.
CIGNA                       Corporation also provides solvency guarantees aggregating $34                       million                       under state and federal regulations in support of its indirect                       wholly                       owned medical HMOs in several states.
CIGNA                       Corporation has arranged a $150 million letter of credit in                       support of                       CIGNA Europe Insurance Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary.                       CIGNA                       Corporation has agreed to indemnify the banks providing the                       letters of                       credit in the event of any draw. CIGNA Europe Insurance Company                       is the                       holder of the letters of credit.
In                       addition, CIGNA Corporation has agreed to indemnify payment                       of losses                       included in CIGNA Europe Insurance Companys reserves on the reinsurance                       business transferred from ACE. As of December 31, 2006, the                       reserve was                       $389 million.
Through             December 31, 2006, no payments have been made on these guarantees and             none are             pending. CIGNA Corporation provided other guarantees to subsidiaries             that, in             the aggregate, do not represent a material risk to CIGNA Corporations results             of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

The change in                       the deferred                       tax asset valuation allowance primarily reflects activity in                       discontinued                       operations. The change in reinsurance recoverable reflects                       a                       reclassification of the gross reinsurance recoverable, with                       no effect on                       the net reinsurance recoverable.
