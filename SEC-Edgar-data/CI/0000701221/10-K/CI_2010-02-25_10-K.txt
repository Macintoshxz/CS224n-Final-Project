BUSINESS A.
Description       of Business CIGNA       Corporation had consolidated shareholders equity of $5.4 billion and assets of       $44.9 billion as of December 31, 2005, and revenues of $16.7 billion for the       year then ended.

2 C.
Health       Care CIGNAs       Health Care operations offer insured and self-funded medical, dental, behavioral       health, prescription drug and other products and services that integrate to       support the delivery of consumerism and health advocacy solutions. These       operations also provide disability and life insurance products which were       historically sold in connection with certain experience-rated medical products       and continue to be managed by CIGNAs health care business.
These       products and services are provided by subsidiaries of CIGNA       Corporation.
Industry       and Strategic Overview CIGNA       believes that the health care business model is evolving to one that focuses       more directly on the health care consumer. Consumerism is designed       to help individuals be better consumers of health care by providing them the       information, support tools, health advocacy and incentives to make more       efficient and better informed health care decisions. CIGNA believes that       engaging consumers more closely in health care decisions can result in improved       health care outcomes and take unnecessary costs out of the system.
Consumerism       represents a transition from a cost-based business model to a value-based model,       under which CIGNA seeks to provide transparency about provider quality and       cost,       customer support tools and services, and health advocacy support, to assist       consumers in making decisions regarding their health care.
CIGNA       has       developed products, educational resources and customer support tools for       consumers and initial capabilities to       improve the quality and transparency of information to employers about the       health needs of their plan participants, intended ultimately, to assist       consumers in making more informed choices regarding their health care and       achieve better health outcomes .       The       shift in the business model toward consumerism is in the early stages, and       CIGNA       believes that its capabilities in consumerism, health advocacy and the ability       to provide useful information to consumers and employers position CIGNA to       meet       the emerging trend.
CIGNA       continually evaluates acquisitions and other transactions that present       opportunities to enhance its product capabilities and provide a basis for lower       medical costs. As part of that strategy, in 2005 CIGNA:  acquired                 Choicelinx, a consumer focused benefits and services company to further                 strengthen its capabilities in consumerism and health                 advocacy;  acquired                 Managed Care Consultants to strengthen its provider network in                 Nevada;  formed                 marketing affiliations with Health Alliance Plan in Michigan and                 Tufts                 Health Plan in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, designed to offer                 national                 products in these and other states;                 and  formed                 a strategic alliance with NationsHealth, Inc. to actively market CIGNATURE                 Rx SM ,                 its Medicare Part D program.
Principal       Products The       customers of CIGNAs Health Care operations range in size from some of the       largest United States corporations to small enterprises, and include employers,       multiple employer groups, unions, governmental entities and other groups.       Products are marketed in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto       Rico.
Products       and Services Medical CIGNA       provides a wide array of products and services to meet the needs of employers       and other groups sponsoring health benefit plans and the employees and       dependents participating in these plans, including consumer directed health       plans, health       maintenance organizations (HMOs), network only (Network) and       point-of-service (POS) medical plans, preferred provider plans (PPOs), and       traditional medical indemnity coverage. CIGNA offers a modular product       portfolio, including CIGNATURE  CareAllies SM and       CIGNA       Choice Fund SM Solutions that offers a choice of benefits network and various funding, medical       management, consumerism and health advocacy options for employers and consumers.       CareAllies provides medical management, disease management, and health advocacy       services to large, complex plan sponsors that allow their employees to choose       from among multiple health care vendors. CareAllies offers a consistent set       of       services to address the clinical and administrative inconsistencies that are       inherent in the multi-vendor approach.
As       a       means to improve health outcomes and take unnecessary costs out of the system,       it is CIGNA's 3 goal       to       provide customers that purchasemore than one product, which might       includeany combination ofmedical, dental, behavioral health,       pharmacy and medical care management, with: (1) a holistic and integrated       approach towardsmembers'health that promotes consistent case       management; and (2) the integration of health care information through       predictive modeling and other tools, to provide targeted outreach and health       advocacy by CIGNA's clinical professionals to members.
CIGNA       also is developing tools to assist employers in choosing product designs to       achieve better health outcomes for their plan participants. For example, CIGNAs       Hi Score  tool       aggregates employee plan participant data (not identifiable by individual)       in       four categories: frequency and type of health care services provided; level       of       employee engagement in their health care decisions; effectiveness of existing       incentives in meeting employee population objectives; and opportunities for       outreach to employees. Hi Score ranks the employer in each of these categories       to show the employers current performance compared to the original baseline and       the employers industry peer group with the goal of enabling employers to modify       actions to potentially improve employee health outcomes and, consequently,       cost       trends.
Consumer       Directed Health Plans.
CIGNA       offers customers the CIGNA Choice Fund suite of consumer directed health plan       products. T he       CIGNA       Choice Fund includes       health reimbursement account (HRA) and health       savings account (HSA) options, both enabled by federal law. The HRA combines       flexible benefit plan designs and the ability of employers to allow roll over       reimbursement accounts from year to year with enhanced decision support tools       and consumer incentive programs. The HSA combines a high deductible payment       feature for the health plan with a tax-preferred account offering mutual fund       or       other savings investment options. Funds in the HSA can be used to pay the       deductible and for other eligible tax-deductible medical       expenses.
HMOs.
HMOs       are       required by law to provide coverage for all basic health services. They use       various tools to facilitate the appropriate utilization of health care services       by members and providers and control unit costs through provider contracts.       Members typically choose a primary care physician from CIGNAs provider network.       Primary care physicians are responsible for the members primary medical       and preventive care. Members may be required to obtain referrals from their       primary care physicians to receive covered non-emergency services from       participating specialists or facilities. CIGNA also offers an open access HMO       product that allows members to obtain covered services from non-participating       providers and without the requirement of a referral from the primary care       physician.
Other       than CIGNA HealthCare of Arizona, Inc., a staff model HMO which employs some       physicians and other providers, all CIGNA HMOs are individual practice       association models utilizing networks of independent physicians, hospitals       and       other health care providers that have directly or indirectly contracted with       the       HMO.
As       of       December 31, 2005, CIGNAs HMO networks included approximately 258,000       physicians and 2,000 hospitals.
Currently,       many contracted providers are compensated by CIGNA on a discounted       fee-for-service or other service-specific basis (such as hospital per diems       or       case rates) for covered health care services provided to the members. Certain       participating providers agree to provide covered services in consideration       for       receiving a monthly predetermined fee (capitation) from CIGNA. Capitation       arrangements shift some of the financial risk from CIGNA to the providers.
In       some       cases, capitated providers subcontract with other providers for certain health       care services. In the event that the capitated provider is paid but fails to       pay       its subcontracted providers, the subcontracted providers or regulators may       look       to CIGNA for payment. CIGNA may, in some cases, voluntarily make additional       payments directly to the subcontracted providers to ensure continuity of care       to       its members through the provider network. A few states have adopted laws or       regulations requiring payment to subcontracted providers in this situation.       CIGNA typically requires a satisfactory letter of credit or other financial       guarantee from the capitated provider entity to protect CIGNA from this possible       exposure, although not all capitated arrangements have this protection.
CIGNA       contracts with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to       provide Medicare HMO coverage for eligible individuals in Arizona. The contract       provides for a fixed per member per month premium from CMS, based upon a formula       that calculates the projected cost of providing services for each Medicare       member. Premium amounts are updated annually. Members generally receive enhanced       benefits over standard Medicare fee-for-service coverage, including prescription       drug and vision coverage, and pay lower, fixed co-payments for services used.       Depending on 4 the       plan       benefits selected, members may be required to pay an additional premium to       CIGNA       for their HMO coverage.
Network,       POS and PPO Medical Products.
CIGNA       offers Network products that cover non-emergency services provided only by       CIGNA       participating providers and emergency services provided by participating and       non-participating providers. CIGNA also offers POS medical plans that cover       health care services provided by participating and non-participating health       care       providers. This allows participants to determine at the point of service whether to obtain covered services from a CIGNA participating provider       (In-Network services) or from a non-participating provider (Out-of-Network services). Participants in POS plans generally pay a fixed co-payment or       co-insurance amount for In-Network covered services. Reimbursement for       Out-of-Network covered services is subject to deductibles and coinsurance,       which       result in a higher cost to participants than In-Network services. CIGNA offers       POS products that allow access to In-Network specialty care without the       requirement of a referral from the primary care physician.
CIGNA       also offers PPO plans. PPO plans are similar to POS plans except that       participants are required to pay coinsurance (a percentage of the charge) for       both In-Network and Out-of-Network covered services. The participants       coinsurance obligation is greater for Out-of-Network services.
Some       of       CIGNAs POS products require that the participant receive a referral from a       primary care physician participating in the CIGNA provider network for coverage       of non-emergency specialty care services. Under this product, the participant       selects a primary care physician and the higher In-Network reimbursement for       specialty care services is available only if the participant has a referral       from       his or her primary care physician to a specialty care provider in the CIGNA       network.
As       of       December 31, 2005, CIGNA's Network, POS and PPO networks included approximately       843,000 physicians and 7,900 hospitals.
Traditional       Medical Indemnity Products.
Traditional       medical indemnity products provide reimbursement for covered services without       regard to whether the provider of the covered service participates in the CIGNA       provider network. Participants are responsible for sharing in the cost of their       care by paying deductibles and coinsurance, subject to annual out-of-pocket       maximums. Some traditional indemnity products utilize CIGNA's network of       participating providers. Patients covered under these plans have an economic       incentive to use the CIGNA participating providers because their coinsurance       is       based upon the providers discounted charge.
CIGNA       HealthCare of Arizona, Inc. is also a participating provider in the       fee-for-service Medicare program, furnishing outpatient care to Medicare       beneficiaries. Reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient services is made       by       CMS pursuant to laws and regulations governing the Medicare program. Currently,       CMS reimburses outpatient services in accordance with payment classification       groups based on historical cost information filed by CIGNA HealthCare of       Arizona, Inc.
Dental CIGNA       offers a variety of dental care products including managed care, PPO and       traditional indemnity products. Customers can purchase CIGNA dental products       as       stand alone products or integrated with CIGNA medical products. Customers have       access to live service representatives and 24 hour on-line assistance through       CIGNA's secure member website, myCIGNA.com.
Managed       dental care products are offered in 36 states and the District of Columbia       through a network of independent providers that have contracted with CIGNA       to       provide dental services to members. Most dentists in the CIGNA network receive       a       monthly predetermined fee (capitation) for each covered member in their patient       panel. Network dentists may also receive additional fees for certain services.       Generally, members are responsible for a fixed co-payment for certain covered       services provided by a network dentist.
CIGNA       also offers dental PPO products similar to the medical PPO products described       above. As of December 31, 2005, CIGNAs national dental PPO network had       approximately 70,200 participating dentists.
Traditional       dental indemnity products also operate in a manner consistent with that       described with respect to medical indemnity products, above.
5 Behavioral       Health CIGNA       provides behavioral health care benefit products, behavioral health care       management, employee assistance programs, and work/life programs to employer       sponsored benefit plans, HMOs, governmental entities and disability insurers.       CIGNA focuses on integrating its programs and services to provide the consumer       with customized, holistic care through such products as:  Custom                 Network Solutions, introduced on January 1, 2006, that give employers                 the                 ability to select four different provider network options to meet                 the                 specific needs of their plan participants;                 and  customized                 on-line self-assessment and help tools for a variety of concerns,                 including stress, grief, relationship issues and depression that                 connect                 consumers to a telephonic or face-to-face counselor as                 appropriate.
As       of       December 31, 2005, CIGNA's behavioral care national network had approximately       40,000 independent psychiatrists, psychologists and clinical social workers       and       approximately 5,000 facilities and clinics that are paid on a contracted       fee-for-service basis.
Pharmacy CIGNA       offers prescription drug coverage plans both on a stand alone basis as well       as       in conjunction with its medical products described above. CIGNA has a nationwide       network of contracted pharmacies that it utilizes in connection with its HMO,       Network, POS and PPO products. In addition, CIGNA provides managed pharmacy       benefit programs in connection with its HMO and POS products.
CIGNA       also offers mail order, telephone and on-line pharmaceutical fulfillment       services through its CIGNA Tel-Drug  operation.
In       addition, CIGNA has developed on-line decision support tools to provide       consumers with information to make their pharmacy-related decisions. The tools       include:  a                 prescription drug price comparison tool that gives members price                 comparisons on branded and generic drugs from pharmacy retailers                 and mail                 order, showing out-of-pocket as well as the total anticipated costs,                 of                 the prescription;  DrugCompare                 and Medication Library where members can obtain detailed information                 and                 comparisons of medications; and  Prescription                 Claim History Tool, which enables consumers to see their combined                 retail                 and home delivery prescription history to help plan for potential                 out-of-pocket costs.
CIGNATURE       Rx .
In       2005,       CIGNA introduced CIGNATURE Rx, its Medicare Part D prescription drug program,       which provides a number of plan options as well as service and information       support. CIGNATURE Rx is provided in alliance with NationsHealth, Inc. and       combines CIGNA's pharmacy product capabilities with NationsHealths service and       distribution capabilities. CIGNATURE Rx is available in all 50 states and the       District of Columbia.
Care       Management CIGNA       strives to help consumers make more informed health care decisions by providing       a number of care management and health advocacy programs and information support       tools that are designed to help improve health and cost outcomes. Some of these       include:  early                 intervention by CIGNA's network of over 3,000 clinical                 professionals;  targeted                 outreach using CIGNA's predictive modeling capabilities through tools                 such                 as the CIGNA Health Advisor Portal;  the                 integration of medical and specialty (pharmacy, dental and behavioral)                 care to help with consistent case management; and  disease                 management programs, including CIGNA Well Aware for Better                 Health  focusing                 on chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease and                 low back                 pain as well as programs introduced in 2005 focusing on depression,                 high                 risk obesity, weight loss and smoking cessation.
CIGNA       has       developed a range of consumer decision support tools including:  MyCIGNA.com, CIGNAs                   consumer Internet portal. The portal is personalized to each members                   CIGNA medical, dental and pharmacy plan information;                   and  a                     number of interactive online cost and quality                     information tools that compare hospital quality and efficiency                     information, prescription drug choices and, beginning in 2006,                     average                     price 6 range       and member-specific estimates for average       out-of-pocket costs for certain medical procedures.
Quality       Outcomes CIGNA's       commitment to promoting quality care is reflected in a variety of activities,       including: the development of the CIGNA Care Network  , described       below; the credentialing of medical providers and facilities that participate       in       CIGNA's managed care and PPO networks, using quality criteria which meet or       exceed external accreditation or state regulatory agency standards, or both;       a       national externally accredited Quality Program, that includes clinical       interventions and quality measurement; and participation in industry initiatives       that provide hospital and physician profiling information to members for more       educated decision making.
CIGNA       Care Network.
CIGNA       Care Network is a benefit design option available January 1, 2006, for CIGNA       plans in 16 service areas across the country.
CIGNA       Care Network is a subset of participating physicians in certain specialties       who       are designated as CIGNA Care Network providers based on specific quality and       efficiency selection criteria. Consumers pay reduced co-payments for choosing       a       specialist designated as a CIGNA Care Network provider. This encourages       consumers to select a physician identified for participation in the CIGNA Care       Network based on quality and efficiency measures. CIGNA participating       s pecialists       are evaluated annually for inclusion in the CIGNA Care Network.
Provider       Credentialing.
CIGNA       credentials physicians, hospitals and other health care providers participating       in its participating provider networks using quality criteria which meets or       exceeds the standards of external accreditation or state regulatory agencies,       or       both.
CIGNA's       practitioner credentialing criteria include verification of a current       unrestricted professional license, a valid and unrestricted license to prescribe       drugs (as appropriate), board certification or other appropriate training and       hospital privileges (as appropriate) at a CIGNA participating facility. In       addition, CIGNA queries the National Practitioner Data Bank to obtain       information about the practitioners malpractice experience and also obtains       Medicare sanction activity. CIGNA expects practitioners to demonstrate an       acceptable history of malpractice claim experience, adequacy of malpractice       insurance coverage and an acceptable work history. Typically, most practitioners       are recredentialed every three years.
To       be       credentialed, CIGNA requires the medical facilities with which it contracts       to       have an unrestricted state license, no sanctions by the Department of Health       and       Human Services, accreditation by an approved accrediting organization and       adequate malpractice and general liability coverage. Typically, most medical       facilities are recredentialed every three years.
NCQA       Accreditation.
Accreditation       by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) of CIGNAs medical HMOs       validates CIGNAs quality program. The NCQA is a nationally recognized       independent, not-for-profit organization dedicated to assessing, measuring       and       reporting on the quality of managed care plans.
As       of       December 31, 2005, 88% of CIGNAs U.S. plan locations are NCQA accredited and,       as of January, 2006, 100% of these accredited plans have received Excellent       or       Commendable accreditation for HMO and POS products.
HEDIS       Measures.
In       addition, CIGNA participates in NCQAs Health Plan Employer Data and Information       Set (HEDIS) Quality Compass Report. HEDIS Effectiveness of Care measures are       a       standard set of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of managed care       organization clinical programs. CIGNAs national results compare favorably to       industry averages.
7 Distribution       and Markets CIGNA       has       organized the sales and distribution of its products in the following segments:  national                 accounts, which are multi-site employers with more than 5,000                 employees;  middle                 market, generally defined as multi-site employers with more than                 200 but                 fewer than 5,000 employees;  small                 business, which includes employers with 2 to 200 employees;  government,                 which includes employees                 in federal, state and local governments, primary and secondary schools,                 and colleges and universities ;  Taft-Hartley,                 which includes members                 covered by union trust funds; and  seniors,                 which focuses on the health care needs of individuals 55 years and                 older.
CIGNA       employs group sales representatives to distribute the products and services       of       this segment through insurance brokers, insurance consultants and directly       to       employers. CIGNA also employs representatives to sell medical cost containment,       managed behavioral health care and employee assistance services directly to       insurance companies, HMOs, third party administrators and employer groups.       As of       December 31, 2005, the field sales force for the products and services of this       segment consisted of approximately 525 sales representatives in 85 field       locations.
CIGNA       believes that the health care consumer will play an increasingly important       role       in the health care product purchasing process and has developed MyCignaPlans.com       as a tool to facilitate this change. MyCignaPlans.com allows prospective members       to access its website before enrolling to compare plan coverage and pricing       options based on a variety of factors. The application gives consumers       information on the total health care cost to them and their employer.
Funding       Arrangements The       segments health care products and services are offered through guaranteed cost,       retrospectively experience-rated, administrative services only (ASO) and       minimum premium funding arrangements.
Under       guaranteed cost funding arrangements, CIGNA charges a fixed premium and bears       the risk for claims and costs in excess of the premium.
Under       retrospectively experience-rated funding arrangements, a premium that typically       includes a margin to partially protect against adverse claim fluctuations is       determined at the beginning of the policy period. CIGNA generally bears the       risk       for costs incurred in excess of premiums, but has the potential to recover       this       deficit from future policyholder renewal premiums. For additional discussion,       see Pricing, Reserves and Reinsurance below.
Under       ASO       funding arrangements, the employer or other plan sponsor self-funds all of       its       claims, and they assume the risk for claim costs incurred. CIGNA makes available       to ASO plans its participating provider network and typically provides claims       processing and other services and programs, including: health quality assurance,       utilization management, cost containment, health advocacy, 24-hour help line,       case management, disease management, pharmacy benefit management, behavioral       health care management services (through its provider networks), or a       combination of the above, in exchange for administrative service fees. The       employer/plan sponsor is responsible for self-funding all claims, but may       purchase stop-loss insurance from CIGNA or other insurers for claims in excess       of some predetermined amount in total or for specific types of claims or both.
Minimum       premium funding arrangements combine insurance protection with an element of       self-funding. The policyholder assumes the risk for, and self-funds, claim       costs       up to a predetermined aggregate, maximum amount, and CIGNA bears the risk for       claim costs incurred in excess of that amount. CIGNA has the potential to       recover this deficit balance from future policyholder renewal premiums.       Accordingly, minimum premium funding arrangements have a risk profile similar       to       retrospectively experience-rated funding arrangements.
Pricing,       Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums       and fees charged for most insured health care products and for disability and       life insurance products are generally set in advance of the policy period and       are guaranteed for one year.
Premium       rates are established either on a guaranteed cost basis or on a retrospectively       experience-rated basis.
8 Charges       to customers established on a guaranteed cost basis at the beginning of the       policy period cannot be adjusted to reflect actual claim experience during       the       policy period. A guaranteed cost pricing methodology reflects assumptions about       future claims, expenses, credit risk, enrollment mix, investment returns,       competitive considerations and profit margins. Claim and expense assumptions       may       be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the account or on a pool       of       accounts, depending on the group size and the statistical credibility of the       experience. Generally, guaranteed cost groups are smaller and less statistically       credible than retrospectively experience-rated groups. In addition, pricing       for       health care products that use networks of contracted providers also reflects       assumptions about the impact of provider contracts on future claims. Premium       rates may vary among accounts to reflect the anticipated contract mix, family       size, industry, renewal date, and other cost-predictive factors. In some states,       premium rates must be approved by the state insurance departments, and state       laws may restrict or limit the use of rating methods.
Premiums       established for retrospectively experience-rated business may be adjusted for       the actual claim and administrative cost experience of the account through       an       experience settlement process subsequent to the policy period. To the extent       that the cost experience is favorable in relation to the prospectively       determined premium rates, a portion of the initial premiums may be credited       to       the policyholder as an experience refund. If claim experience is adverse in       relation to the initial premiums, CIGNA may recover the resulting experience       deficit, according to contractual provisions, through future premiums and       experience settlements, provided the contract remains in force.
CIGNA       contracts on an ASO basis with customers who fund their own claims. CIGNA       charges these customers administrative fees based on the expected cost of       administering their self-funded programs. These fees reflect anticipated or       actual experience with respect to claim volumes, expenses, competitive       considerations, and profit margins. In some cases, CIGNA provides performance       guarantees related to identified performance. If these standards are not met,       CIGNA may be financially at risk up to a percentage of the contracted fee or       a       stated dollar amount.
In       addition to paying current benefits and expenses under insurance policies and       HMO service agreements, CIGNA establishes reserves in amounts estimated to       be       sufficient to settle reported claims not yet paid, as well as claims incurred       but not yet reported. Also, liabilities are established for estimated experience       refunds based on the results of retrospectively experience-rated policies and       applicable contract terms.
As       of       December 31, 2005, approximately $1.4 billion, or 62% of the reserves of this       segment comprise liabilities that are likely to be paid within one year,       primarily for medical and dental claims, as well as certain group disability       and       life insurance claims. Of the reserve amount expected to be paid within one       year, $320 million relates to amounts recoverable from certain ASO customers       and       from minimum premium policyholders, and is offset by a receivable. The remaining       reserves are primarily short term with a long tail and include liabilities       for       group long-term disability insurance benefits and group life insurance benefits       for disabled and retired individuals, benefits paid in the form of both life       and       non-life contingent annuities to survivors and contract holder deposit funds.
CIGNA       credits interest on fund balances to retrospectively experience-rated       policyholders through rates that are set at CIGNAs discretion taking investment       performance and market rates into consideration. Generally, for       interest-crediting rates set at CIGNAs discretion, higher rates are credited to       funds with longer terms reflecting the fact that higher yields are generally       available on investments with longer maturities. For 2005, the rates of interest       credited ranged from 2.75% to 4.32%, with a weighted average rate of       3.30%.
The       profitability of CIGNA's fully insured health care products depends on the       adequacy of premiums charged relative to claims and expenses. For medical and       dental products, profitability reflects the accuracy of cost projections for       health care (unit costs and utilization), the adequacy of fees charged for       administration and risk assumption and effective medical cost and utilization       management.
CIGNA       reduces its exposure to large catastrophe losses under group life, disability       and accidental death contracts by purchasing reinsurance from unaffiliated       reinsurers.
Competition The       health care businesses described in this segment are subject to intense       competition. Recent industry consolidation has intensified an already       competitive business environment. While no one competitor or small number of       competitors dominates the health care market, CIGNA expects a continuing trend       of consolidation in the industry with the emergence of consumerism intensifying       this development.
9 Also,       in       certain geographic locations some health care companies may have significant       market share positions. A large number of health care companies and other       entities compete in offering similar products. Competition in the health care       market exists both for employer-policyholders and for the employees in those       instances where the employer offers its employees the choice of products of       more       than one health care company. Most group policies are subject to annual review       by the policyholder, which may seek competitive quotations prior to renewal.
The       principal competitive factors that affect this segment are quality of service;       scope, cost-effectiveness and quality of provider networks; effectiveness of       medical care management; product responsiveness to the needs of customers and       their employees; cost-containment services; technology; price; and effectiveness       of marketing and sales. In addition, financial strength of the insurer, as       indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also       a       competitive factor. For more information concerning insurance ratings, see       Ratings in Section K beginning on page 25 .
CIGNA       believes that its national scope, integrated approach to consumerism, product       breadth, clinical care and medical management capabilities and funding options       are strategic competitive advantages. These advantages allow CIGNA to respond       to       the diverse needs of its customer base in each market in which it       operates.
The       principal competitors of CIGNAs managed care and indemnity businesses       are:  other                 large insurance companies that provide group health and life insurance                 products;  Blue                 Cross and Blue Shield                 organizations;  stand-alone                 HMOs and PPOs;  HMOs                 affiliated with major insurance companies and hospitals;                 and  national                 managed pharmacy, behavioral health and cost containment services                 companies.
Competition       also arises from smaller regional or specialty companies with strength in a       particular geographic area or product line, administrative service firms and,       indirectly, self-insurers. In addition to these traditional competitors, a       new       group of competitors is emerging. These new competitors are focused on       delivering employee benefits and services through Internet-enabled technology       that allow consumers to take a more active role in the management of their       health. This is accomplished primarily through financial incentives and access       to enhanced medical quality data. Management believes that it has the       capabilities and appropriate strategy to allow it to compete against both the       traditional and new competitors.
The       effective use of web-based information tools and technology are critical to       success in the health care industry, and CIGNA believes they will be competitive       differentiators.
Financial       information about the Health Care segment is presented in the MD&A section       and Note 19 to CIGNA's 2005 Financial Statements included in its 2005 Annual       Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
10 D.
Disability       and Life Principal       Products and Markets CIGNAs       Disability and Life operations provide the following insurance products and       their related services: long- and short-term disability insurance, disability       and workers compensation case management, group life insurance, and accident       and specialty insurance. These products and services are provided by       subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation. CIGNA markets these group insurance products       and services to employers, employees, professional and other associations and       other groups.
The       following table sets forth the net premiums and fees for this segment by its       principal products.
Year                 Ended December                 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In                 millions) Disability $ 677 $ 617 $ 538 Life 1,108 1,041 977 Other 280 265 292 Total                 Premiums and Fees $ 2,065 $ 1,923 $ 1,807 Disability       Insurance CIGNA       markets group long-term and short-term disability insurance products in all       states and statutorily required disability insurance plans in certain states.       These products generally provide a fixed level of income to replace a portion       of       wages lost because of disability. They also provide assistance to the employee       in returning to work and assistance to the employer in managing the cost of       employee disability.
CIGNA       also provides case management and related services to workers compensation       insurers and employers who self-fund workers compensation and disability       benefits.
CIGNAs       disability insurance products may be coordinated with behavioral programs,       workers compensation, medical programs, social security advocacy, and the       Family and Medical Leave Act and leave of absence administration. This       integration provides customers with increased efficiency and effectiveness       in       disability claims management. CIGNA may receive fees for providing integration       services to clients.
Life       Insurance Group       life insurance products include group term life and group universal life. CIGNA       no longer markets variable universal life insurance but continues to administer       the products for existing policyholders. Group term life insurance may be       employer-paid basic life insurance or employee-paid supplemental life insurance.
Group       universal life insurance is a voluntary life insurance product in which the       owner may accumulate cash value. The cash value earns interest at rates declared       from time to time, subject to a minimum guaranteed rate, and may be borrowed,       withdrawn, or used to fund future life insurance coverage. With group variable       universal life insurance, the cash value varies directly with the performance       of       the underlying investments and neither the return nor the principal is       guaranteed.
Approximately       5,200 group life insurance policies covering approximately 5.8 million lives       were outstanding as of December 31, 2005.
Other CIGNA       offers personal accident insurance coverage, which consists primarily of       accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident insurance to employers.       Group accident insurance may be employer-paid or employee-paid.
CIGNA       also offers specialty insurance services that consist primarily of life,       accident and disability insurance to professional associations, financial       institutions, schools and participant organizations.
Distribution CIGNA       employs group sales representatives to distribute the products and services       of       this segment through insurance brokers and consultants. As of December 31,       2005,       the field sales force for the products and services of this segment consisted       of       approximately 160 sales representatives in 26 field locations.
Pricing,       Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums       and fees charged for disability and life insurance products are generally       established in advance of the policy period and are often guaranteed 11 for       two       years to three years, but contracts may be subject to termination.
Premium       rates reflect assumptions about future claims, expenses, credit risk, investment       returns, competitive considerations and profit margins. Claim and expense       assumptions may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the account       or on a pool of accounts, depending on the group size and the statistical       credibility of the experience.
Fees       for       universal life insurance products consist of mortality, administrative and       surrender charges assessed against the contractholders fund balance. Interest       credited and mortality charges for universal life, and mortality charges on       variable universal life, may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected       interest and mortality experience.
In       addition to paying current benefits and expenses, CIGNA establishes reserves       in       amounts estimated to be sufficient to settle reported claims not yet paid,       as       well as claims incurred but not yet reported. For liabilities with longer-term       pay-out periodssuch as long-term disability, reserves represent the       present value of future expected payments.
CIGNA       discounts these reserves based on interest rate assumptions. The annual       effective interest rate assumption used in determining reserves for most of       the       long-term disability insurance business is 4.25% for claims that were incurred       in 2005 and 5.10% for claims that were incurred in 2004 and prior years.
For       universal life insurance, CIGNA establishes reserves for deposits received       and       interest credited to the contractholder, less mortality and administrative       charges assessed against the contractholders fund balance.
The       profitability of this segments products depends on the adequacy of premiums       charged relative to claims and expenses. Profitability of disability insurance       products is impacted by the effectiveness of return to work programs as well       as       adequate return on invested assets. For life insurance products, profitability       is affected by the degree to which future experience deviates from mortality,       morbidity and expense assumptions.
CIGNA       reduces its exposure to large individual and catastrophe losses under group       life, disability and accidental death contracts by purchasing reinsurance from       unaffiliated reinsurers.
Competition The       principal competitive factors that affect the products of the Disability and       Life segment are underwriting and pricing, relative operating efficiency,       distribution methodologies and producer relations, variety of products and       services offered, and the quality of customer service and claims       management.
For       certain products with longer-term liabilities, such as group long-term       disability insurance, financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings       issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also a competitive factor.       For more information concerning insurance ratings, see Ratings in       Section K beginning on page 25 .
The       principal competitors of CIGNAs group disability, life and accident businesses       are other large and regional insurance companies that market and distribute       these products.
CIGNA       is       one of the top five providers of group disability, life and accident insurance,       based on premiums.

International Principal       Products and Markets CIGNAs       international operations (International) provide various coverages, products       and services in selected markets outside the United States, principally in       Asia       (mainly South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and Europe (mainly the United Kingdom       and Spain). In addition, CIGNA provides group benefits products in numerous       markets for expatriate employees of multinational companies.
The       coverages, products and services of this segment, which are provided by       subsidiaries of CIGNA Corporation, relate to individual and group life       insurance, accident and health insurance and health care products.
The       following table sets forth the principal lines of business of this segment       and       their related net earned premiums and fees: Year                 Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (In                 millions) Life,                 Accident and Health $ 677 $ 545 $ 430 Health                 Care 566 481 425 Total                 Premiums and Fees $ 1,243 $ 1,026 $ 855 ____________________________________________ 13 Life,       accident and health products are designed to meet the insurance, savings and       investment needs of consumers in selected markets outside of U.S. insurance       markets. These products       are marketed on both group and individual bases. Life insurance products include       term, whole life, endowment and variable universal life. Supplemental products       include accidental death, medical, hospitalization, cancer and other dread       disease coverages.
The       health care products the International segment provides are primarily indemnity       insurance coverage, with some products having managed care or administrative       service aspects. These products generally provide an alternative or supplement       to government programs. Health care includes life and medical insurance products       that are provided through group benefits programs as well as medical insurance       products that are marketed directly to individuals.
Health       care also includes global group benefits products for employees of multinational       companies (primarily U.S. and European multinational companies) who work outside       of their country of citizenship. This product group includes medical, dental,       vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability coverage, as       well as primary medical and dental benefits for international travelers.
CIGNA       generally conducts its international businesses through foreign operating       entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies, which reduces       the exposure to economic loss resulting from unfavorable exchange rate       movements. For information on the effect of foreign exchange exposure, see       Market Risk in the MD&A section, and Note 2R to CIGNAs 2005 Financial       Statements included in its 2005 Annual Report.
Internationals       healthcare and life, accident and health products include coverage for employees       and individuals who may be exposed to acts of terrorism, the events of a war       zone or natural disasters. These risks could result in a concentration of loss       if a single adverse event affected many covered individuals.
South       Korea represents the single largest geographic market for CIGNA's international       businesses. In 2005, South Korea generated 27% of Internationals revenues and       41% of its segment earnings. Internationals business in South Korea would be       vulnerable to adverse consumer credit conditions in that country. In addition,       geopolitical and economic events in South Korea could have a significant impact       on the International segment.
Distribution International       distributes its products through a combination of independent brokers and       agents, agents of strategic partners, financial institutions and various direct       marketing channels. Life, accident and health products are primarily distributed       through direct marketing, including telemarketing and direct mail under a       variety of sponsored arrangements; the Internet; and financial institutions.       Health care products are distributed through independent brokers and agents       as       well as the companys own sales personnel.
Pricing,       Reserves and Reinsurance Premiums       for life, accident and health insurance products are based on assumptions about       mortality, morbidity, persistency, expenses and target profit margins, as well       as interest rates and competitive considerations. The profitability of these       products is affected by the degree to which future experience deviates from       these assumptions.
Fees       for       variable universal life insurance products consist of mortality, administrative       and surrender charges assessed against the contractholders fund balance.       Mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively       to       reflect expected mortality experience.
Premiums       and fees for health care products reflect assumptions about future claims,       expenses, investment returns, competitive considerations and profit margins.       For       products using networks of contracted providers, premiums reflect assumptions       about the impact of provider contracts and utilization management on future       claims. Most of the premium volume for the medical indemnity business is on       a       guaranteed cost basis. Other premiums are established on an experience-rated       basis. Most contracts permit rate changes at least annually.
The       profitability of health care products is dependent upon the accuracy of       projections for health care inflation (unit cost and utilization), the adequacy       of fees charged for administration and risk assumption and, in the case of       managed care products, effective medical cost management.
In       addition to paying current benefits and expenses, CIGNA establishes reserves       in       amounts estimated to be sufficient to settle reported claims not yet paid,       as       well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Additionally, for some individual life insurance and supplemental health       products, CIGNA establishes policy reserves that reflect the present 14 value       of       expected future obligations less the present value of expected future premiums.
CIGNA       reduces its exposure to large and/or multiple losses arising out of a single       occurrence by purchasing reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers.
Competition The       principal competitive factors that affect the International operations are       underwriting and pricing, relative operating efficiency, relative effectiveness       in medical cost management, quality of provider networks and relationships,       product innovation and differentiation, distribution methodologies and producer       relations, and the quality of claims and policyholder services. In most overseas       markets, perception of financial strength is also an important competitive       factor.
Internationals       primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations, as       well       as other, non-U.S., global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and       local markets. For the life, accident and health lines of business, locally       based competitors are primarily indigenous life insurance companies, but also       include financial institutions and insurance subsidiaries of banks. CIGNA       expects that the competitive environment will intensify as U.S. and Europe-based       insurance and financial services providers pursue global expansion       opportunities.

Other       Operations Other       Operations consists of:  deferred                 gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance                 and                 annuity business;  corporate                 life insurance (including policies on which loans are                 outstanding);  settlement                 annuity business; and  certain                 investment management services (a significant portion of which were                 sold                 in 2004).
The       products and services related to these operations are offered by subsidiaries       of       CIGNA Corporation.
CIGNA       sold its individual life insurance and annuity business in 1998. A portion       of       the gain was deferred because the principal agreement to sell this business       was       an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. The deferred portion is being recognized       at the rate that earnings from the sold business would have been expected to       emerge, primarily over 15 years on a declining basis. Because it was an       indemnity reinsurance transaction, CIGNA is not relieved ofprimary       liability for the reinsured business.
CIGNA       sold its retirement business in 2004 but retained the corporate life insurance       business previously reported in that segment. Corporate life insurance products       are permanent life insurance contracts sold to corporations to provide coverage       on the lives of certain of their employees. Permanent life insurance, which       is       non-participating, provides coverage that when adequately funded does not expire       after a term of years and builds a cash value that may equal the full policy       amount if the insured is alive on the policy maturity date. Non-participating       insurance does not pay dividends, but deviations from assumed experience may       be       reflected in future policy values.
Corporate       life insurance products include universal life and variable universal life.
Universal       life policies typically provide flexible coverage and flexible premium payments.       Universal life cash values fluctuate with the amount of the premiums paid,       mortality and expense charges made, and interest credited to the policy.       Variable universal life policies are universal life contracts where the cash       values vary directly with the performance of the investments underlying the       policy.
Interest       is credited on most nonvariable universal life products at a declared rate       equal       to or above a minimum guaranteed rate. Credited interest rates vary with the       characteristics of each product and the anticipated investment results of the       assets backing these products. Where the credited interest rate exceeds the       guaranteed rate, the excess is used to purchase additional insurance or increase       cash values. Credited interest rates on these products for 2005 ranged from       2.33% to 5.44%, with a weighted average rate of 4.61%, compared with a range       from 2.23% to 6.06% and a weighted average of 4.58% for 2004.
In       lieu       of credited interest rates, holders of certain nonvariable universal life       contracts may select the option of receiving credited income based on changes       in       an equity index, such as the S&P 500  . No such elections were       made in 2004 or 2005. If such an equity index is used, CIGNA may purchase       derivative options to minimize the effect of the income credited for such       contracts.
Federal       legislation enacted in 1996 eliminated the tax deduction for policy loan       interest for most leveraged corporate life insurance products. There have been       no sales of this product since 1997. As a result of an Internal Revenue Service       initiative to settle tax disputes regarding these products, some customers       have       surrendered their policies and management expects earnings associated with       these       products to continue to decline.
CIGNAs       settlement annuity business is a run-off block of contracts. These contracts       are       primarily liability settlements with approximately half of the payments       guaranteed and not contingent on survivorship.

Investments       and Investment Income CIGNAs       investment operations provide investment management and related services in       the       United States primarily for CIGNAs corporate invested assets and the       insurance-related invested assets in its General Account ("Invested Assets").       CIGNA acquires or originates, directly or through intermediaries, various       investments including private placements, public securities, mortgage loans,       real estate and short-term investments. CIGNAs Invested Assets are managed       primarily by CIGNA subsidiaries and external managers with whom CIGNA's       subsidiaries contract.
CIGNAs       Invested Assets under management at December 31, 2005 totaled $21.4 billion.
As         of         December 31, 2005, CIGNA's Separate Account funds consisted of:  $4.8                 billion in separate account assets that are managed by the buyer                 of the                 retirement benefits business pursuant to modified coinsurance                 arrangements; and  $3.8                 billion in funds directly managed by CIGNA which support certain                 health                 care and disability and life products.
CIGNA         also managed, as of December 31, 2005, $73 million in customer assets for         which         the customer retains title. These customer assets together with the Separate         Account assets managed directly by CIGNA are referred to as Advisory Portfolio         Assets. The income, gains and losses for Advisory Portfolio Assets generally         accrue to contractholders and are not included in CIGNA's revenues and expenses,         although the assets in Separate Accounts and related liabilities are separately         presented on CIGNA's balance sheet.
Types       of Investments CIGNA       invests in a broad range of asset classes, including domestic and international       fixed maturities and common stocks, mortgage loans, real estate and short-term       investments. Fixed maturity investments include publicly traded and private       placement corporate bonds, government bonds, publicly traded and private       placement asset-backed securities, and redeemable preferred stocks.
Domestic       Employee Benefits Investments The       major       portfolios under management in CIGNAs General Account consist of the combined       assets of the Health Care, Disability and Life, Other Operations, Run-off       Retirement and Run-off       Reinsurance segments       (collectively, Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios). As of December 31, 2005       the       Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios had $19.6 billion in Invested       Assets.
CIGNA       generally manages the characteristics of these assets to reflect the underlying       characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities, as well       as       regulatory and tax considerations pertaining to those liabilities. CIGNAs       domestic insurance and contractholder liabilities as of December 31, 2005,       excluding liabilities of businesses sold through use of reinsurance, were       associated with the following products: fully guaranteed annuity, 27%;       interest-sensitive life insurance, 27%; and other life and health, 46%. These       products, and the investment assets supporting them, are described       below.
Fully       guaranteed products primarily include single premium annuity products and       settlement annuities. Because these products generally do not permit withdrawal       by policyholders prior to maturity, the amount and timing of future benefit       cash       flows can be reasonably estimated. Funds supporting these products are invested       in fixed income investments that generally match the aggregate duration of       the       investment portfolio with that of the related benefit cash flows. As of December       31, 2005, the duration of assets that supported these liabilities was       approximately 13.6 years for settlement annuities and 7.2 years for single       premium annuities.
Interest-sensitive       products primarily consist of corporate life insurance products. Invested assets       supporting these products are primarily fixed income investments and policy       loans. Fixed income investments emphasize investment yield while meeting the       liquidity requirements of the related liabilities.
Other       life and health insurance products consist of various group and individual       life,       health and disability insurance products and guaranteed minimum death benefits.       The supporting invested assets are structured to emphasize investment income,       and the necessary liquidity is provided through cash flow, short-term and fixed       maturity investments. Assets supporting longer-term group disability insurance       benefits and group life waiver of premium benefits are generally managed to       an       aggregate duration similar to that of the related benefit cash       flows.
Investment       Strategy Investment       strategy and results are affected by the amount and timing of cash available       for       investment, competition for investments (especially in private asset classes),       economic conditions, interest rates and asset allocation decisions.
CIGNA       routinely monitors and evaluates the status of its investments in light of       current economic 17 conditions,       trends in capital markets and other factors. Such factors include industry       sector considerations for fixed maturity investments, and geographic and       property-type considerations for mortgage loan and real estate investments.
Fixed       Maturities As       of       December 31, 2005, fixed maturity investments constituted 70% of the Domestic       Employee Benefits portfolios.
CIGNA       invests primarily in investment grade fixed maturities rated by rating agencies       (for public investments) and by CIGNA (for private investments). For information       about below investment grade holdings, see Investment Assets in the MD&A       section of CIGNAs 2005 Annual Report.
Mortgages       and Real Estate Mortgage       loan investments constituted 20% of the Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios       as       of December 31, 2005. Mortgage loan investments are subject to underwriting       criteria addressing loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage, cash flow,       tenant quality, leasing, market, location and borrowers financial strength.       Such investments consist primarily of first mortgage loans on commercial       properties and are diversified by property type, location and borrower. CIGNA       invests in mortgages on fully completed and substantially leased commercial       properties. Virtually all of CIGNAs mortgage loans are balloon payment loans,       under which all or a substantial portion of the loan principal is due at the       end       of the loan term.
CIGNA       enters into joint ventures with local partners to develop, lease and manage       commercial real estate to maximize investment returns. CIGNA's portfolio of       real       estate investments consist of properties under development and stabilized       properties, and are diversified relative to property type and location. CIGNA       also acquires real estate through foreclosure of mortgage loans. CIGNA       rehabilitates, re-leases and sells foreclosed properties, a process that usually       takes from two to four years unless       management considers a near-term sale preferable. Additionally, CIGNA invests       in       third party sponsored real estate equity funds to maximize investment returns       and to maintain diversity with respect to its real estate related exposure.       CIGNA sold $11 million of foreclosed properties in 2005. Real estate investments       were not a significant portion of CIGNAs Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios       as of December 31, 2005.
Derivative       Instruments CIGNA       generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize its exposure to       certain market risks. CIGNA has also written derivative instruments to minimize       insurance customers market risks. In addition, to enhance investment returns,       CIGNA invests in indexed credit default swaps. For information about CIGNAs use       of derivative financial instruments, see Notes 2(B) and 10G to CIGNAs 2005       Financial Statements included in its 2005 Annual Report.
See       Investment Assets in the MD&A section of, and Notes 2, 10, 11 and 14 to       the Financial Statements included in CIGNAs 2005 Annual Report for additional       information about CIGNAs investments.
Other       Investments In       addition to the Domestic Employee Benefits portfolios, CIGNA has a portfolio       which includes the investments of the International segment and unallocated       corporate investments. Invested assets for International and unallocated       corporate investments totaled $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2005. Investments       include U.S. and international fixed maturities, policy loans, mortgage loans       and short-term investments.
18 H.
Run-off       Retirement On       April       1, 2004, CIGNA sold its retirement benefits businesses. CIGNA no longer sells       the products related to the sold businesses. For additional information about       the sale transaction, see Sale of Retirement Benefits Business in the MD&A       section, and Note 3 to CIGNAs 2005 Financial Statements included in its 2005       Annual Report.
The       sale       of CIGNA's retirement benefits business was primarily in the form of a       reinsurance arrangement. Upon the sale, CIGNA reinsured with the buyer of the       retirement business $16.0 billion of general account contractholder liabilities       under an indemnity reinsurance arrangement and $35.3 billion of insurance,       contractholder and separate account liabilities under modified coinsurance       arrangements, including $32.0 billion in separate account liabilities, and       $2.0       billion related to the single premium annuity business described       below.
The       General and Separate Accounts Since       the       sale in 2004, the buyer of the retirement business has entered into agreements       with many of the insured party contractholders relieving CIGNA of any remaining       contractual obligations to those parties (novation agreements). As a result,       CIGNA reduced reinsurance recoverables, contractholder deposit funds and       separate account balances for these obligations.
The       buyer       deposited assets associated with the reinsurance of general account contracts       other than the single premium annuity business into a trust (the "Ceded Business       Trust"), which provides security to CIGNA for the related reinsurance       recoverables. The buyer is permitted to withdraw assets from the Ceded Business       Trust equal to the reduction in CIGNA's reserves whenever such a reduction       occurs. For example, such reductions will occur when the buyer enters into       additional novation agreements and assumes the direct liability to the insured       party. As of December 31, 2005, assets totaling $1.7 billion remained in the       Ceded Business Trust.
Single       Premium Annuity Business The       single premium annuity business consists primarily of single premium annuities       that are supported by CIGNA's general account. This business is reinsured on       a       modified coinsurance basis for the first two years following the sale. Assets       associated with this business are held in a trust of which the buyer is the       beneficiary (the "Trust").
The       buyer       has given notice that it intends to terminate its reinsurance of the single       premium annuity business effective April 1, 2006. Discussions between the two       parties continue. If the buyer terminates its reinsurance, CIGNA would retain       the single premium annuity business, including the trust assets and the       insurance liabilities. CIGNA does not expect the ultimate outcome of these       discussions to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of       operation, liquidity or financial condition .
As       of       December 31, 2005, CIGNA had approximately $1.9 billion in assets in the trust       for the single premium annuity business, consisting primarily of fixed       maturities and mortgage loans.

Run-off       Reinsurance Principal       Products and Markets Until       June of 2000, CIGNA offered reinsurance coverage for part or all of the risks       written by other insurance companies under life and annuity policies (both       group       and individual); accident policies (personal accident, catastrophe and workers compensation coverages); and health policies. These products were sold       principally in North America and Europe through a small sales force and through       intermediaries.
In       2000,       CIGNA sold its U.S. individual life, group life and accidental death reinsurance       business. CIGNA placed its remaining reinsurance businesses (including its       accident, domestic health, international life and health, and specialty life       reinsurance businesses) into run-off as of June 1, 2000, and stopped       underwriting new reinsurance business.
For       the       run-off reinsurance business, CIGNA has established policy reserves that reflect       the present value of expected future obligations less the present value of       expected premiums. In addition, CIGNA establishes loss reserves for claims       received but not yet paid, based on the amount of the claim received, and for       losses incurred but not reported, based on prior claim experience.
Guaranteed       Minimum Death Benefit Contracts.
CIGNAs       reinsurance operations reinsured a guaranteed minimum death benefit under       certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies. These variable       annuities are essentially investments in mutual funds combined with a death       benefit. CIGNA has equity market risks as a result of this product.
For       additional information about guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts, see       Other Matters under Run-off Reinsurance in the MD&A section of, and Note       6 to CIGNA's 2005 Financial Statements included in its 2005 Annual Report.
Guaranteed       Minimum Income Benefit Contracts .       CIGNAs       reinsurance business also wrote reinsurance contracts with issuers of variable       annuity contracts that provide annuitants with certain guarantees related to       minimum income benefits. When annuitants elect to receive these minimum income       benefits, CIGNA may be required to make payments based on changes in underlying       mutual fund values and interest rates.
For       additional information about guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts, see       Other Matters under Run-off Reinsurance and Guaranteed minimum income       benefit contracts under Guarantees and Contractual Obligations in the       MD&A section of, and Note 20C to CIGNA's 2005 Financial Statements included       in its 2005 Annual Report.
Unicover       and Other Run-off Reinsurance The       Run-off Reinsurance operations participate in a workers compensation       reinsurance pool, which ceased accepting new risks in early 1999. This pool       was       formerly managed by Unicover Managers, Inc. The pool purchased significant       reinsurance (retrocessional) protection for its assumed risks. Disputes       concerning these retrocessional contracts have resulted in a number of       arbitrations, most of which have been resolved or settled. The remaining       disputes are expected to be resolved in 2006.
Run-off       Reinsurance also includes other (non-Unicover) workers compensation reinsurance       contracts, as well as personal accident reinsurance contracts, including       contracts assumed in the London market. CIGNA is in dispute and arbitration       with       some ceding companies over the amount of liabilities assumed under their       contracts, and expects that these disputes and arbitrations will be       substantially resolved by the end of 2007.
In       addition, CIGNA obtained retrocessional reinsurance coverage for a significant       portion of its liabilities under these contracts and some of these       retrocessionaires have disputed the validity of their contracts with       CIGNA. Many of these disputes with retrocessionaires have been resolved or       settled. Most of the remaining significant disputes relating to the       retrocessional reinsurance coverage are expected to be resolved in 2006. CIGNA bears the risk of loss if the retrocessionaires are unable to meet their       reinsurance obligations to CIGNA.
Unfavorable       claims experience related to workers compensation and personal accident       exposures is possible and could result in future losses, including losses       attributable to the inability to recover amounts from retrocessionaires (either       due to disputes with the retrocessionaires or their financial       condition).
CIGNAs         reserves for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires, as well as for reserves         associated with underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by CIGNA, are         considered appropriate as of December31, 2005, based on current         information. However, it is possible that future developments could have         a         material adverse effect on CIGNAs consolidated results of operations, and, in         certain 20 situations,         could have a material adverse effect on CIGNAs financial         condition.

21 J.
Regulation CIGNAs       subsidiaries, depending on the type and location of their business activities,       may be subject to regulation by federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions.       CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries and HMOs are licensed to do business in, and are       subject to regulation and supervision by, state regulatory authorities as well       as authorities in the District of Columbia, certain U.S. territories and various       non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The       extent of regulation of insurance subsidiaries and HMOs varies. Licensing of       insurers, HMOs and their agents and the approval of coverage and provider       contract forms are usually required.
All       states in which CIGNA's insurance and HMO subsidiaries do business regulate       their activities. State laws and regulations govern numerous aspects of their       businesses including policy forms, premium rates, claims and appeal processing,       solvency, underwriting practices and standards of care.
CIGNA's       focus on consumer directed products is driven, in part, by the availability       of       enhanced saving incentives under federal and state law and CIGNA's       ability to provide high       deductible health plans. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and       Modernization Act of 2003 offered federal tax incentives for health savings       accounts. In 2005, seven states enacted legislation to provide tax incentives       for such accounts and seven other states are considering such incentives. While       a variety of state statutes currently limit the availability of high deductible       health plans, eleven states took legislative action in 2005 to remove such       impediments. Legislation is pending in other states to address statutory       restrictions on the use of high deductible plans.
The       financial condition of licensed insurance companies and HMOs is closely       monitored by state regulators. States regulate the form and content of statutory       financial statements and the type and concentration of investments. Each       insurance and HMO subsidiary is required to file periodic financial reports       with       regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which it does business, and its       operations and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at regular       intervals.
Most       states and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions require licensed insurance companies       to support guaranty       associations or indemnity funds, which are established to pay claims on behalf       of insolvent insurance companies. In the United States, these associations       levy       assessments on member insurers in a particular state to pay such claims. These       assessments are levied in proportion to the member insurers relative shares of       the lines of business that had been written by the insolvent insurer. The       maximum assessment permitted by law in any one year is generally 2% of annual       premiums written by each member in a particular state with respect to the       categories of business involved and may be offset in some states over a       five-year period against premium taxes payable.
In       addition, insurance companies are subject to a variety of assessments to fund       insurance-related activities such as medical risk pools and operating expenses       of state regulatory bodies.
Several       states also require HMOs to participate in guaranty funds, special risk pools       and administrative funds. CIGNA expects additional states to consider revising       their solvency standards and guaranty fund legislation to encompass HMOs. For       additional information about guaranty fund and other assessments, see Note       20 to       CIGNAs 2005 Financial Statements included in its 2005 Annual Report.
Some       states require health insurers and HMOs to participate in assigned risk plans,       joint underwriting authorities, pools or other residual market mechanisms to       cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards.
The       National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed model       solvency-related laws that many states have adopted. The NAIC also has developed       risk-based capital rules (RBC rules) for life and health insurance companies       and HMOs that have been adopted by many states.
The       NAIC       is considering changing statutory reserving rules for variable annuities. Any       changes would apply to CIGNAs specialty life reinsurance contracts.
The       RBC       rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality       of       investments held, the types of business written and the types of liabilities       maintained. Depending on the ratio of the insurers adjusted surplus to its       risk-based capital, the insurer could be subject to various regulatory actions       ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship.
22 In       addition, various non-U.S. jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements       that are based upon solvency, liquidity and reserve coverage measures. CIGNAs       life, health and non-U.S. insurance and HMO subsidiaries were adequately       capitalized during 2005 under applicable RBC and non-U.S. surplus       rules.
Certain       CIGNA insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws regulating insurers       that       are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies. Under such laws, certain       dividends, distributions and other transactions between an insurance subsidiary       and the holding company or its other subsidiaries may require notification       to,       or be subject to the approval of, one or more state insurance       commissioners.
State       and       federal regulatory scrutiny of life and health insurance company and HMO       marketing and advertising practices, including the adequacy of disclosure       regarding products and their administration, may result in increased regulation.       States have responded to concerns about marketing, advertising and       administration of insurance by increasing the number and frequency of market       conduct examinations and imposing larger penalties for violations of laws and       regulations pertaining to these functions.
Several       state regulatory inquiries have been made into broker compensation practices       for       property and casualty, disability, group insurance and health care products.       The       California Insurance Commissioner also filed suit against several insurance       holding companies, including CIGNA, regarding broker compensation practices.       This increased regulatory focus may lead to legislative or regulatory changes       that would affect the manner in which CIGNA and its competitors compensate       brokers. For more information regarding the state attorney general inquiries,       seeLegal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages 33 and 34 .
CIGNA       sells many of its products and services to sponsors of employee health care       benefit plans that are typically governed by the Employment Retirement Income       Security Act (ERISA) and, therefore, may be subject to requirements imposed by       ERISA on plan fiduciaries and parties in interest, including regulations       affecting claims and appeals procedures for disability, life and accident and       health care claims.
CIGNA       also offers a variety of products and services subject to federal Medicare       regulations. Subsidiaries offer individual and group Medicare Advantage (HMO)       coverage in Arizona. In addition, CIGNA has contractual arrangements with the       federal government by which CIGNA provides claims processing and other       administrative services to the government with respect to certain Medicare       claims. Beginning in 2006, new Medicare Part D products also increase CIGNAs       exposure to federal Medicare regulations.
Participation       in government sponsored health care programs subjects CIGNA to a variety of       federal laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under       the programs (which may occur in years subsequent to when CIGNA provides the       applicable services). These risks include reimbursement claims as well as       potential fines and penalties.
For       example, the       federal government requires Medicare and Medicaid providers to file detailed       cost reports for health care services provided. These reports may be audited       in       subsequent years. Also, under       Office of Personnel Management rules, CIGNA HMOs that contract to cover federal       employees may be required to reimburse the federal government if, following       an       audit, it is determined that a federal employee group did not receive the       benefit of a discount offered by a CIGNA HMO to one of the two groups closest       in       size to the federal employee group. See Health Care in Section C beginning on page 3 for additional information about CIGNAs       participation in government health-related programs.
The       Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and other       federal statutes subject health care insurers and HMOs to federal regulation.       HIPAA imposes electronic data security standards, guaranteed issuance (for       groups with 50 or fewer lives), renewal and portability requirements on health       care insurers.
In       addition, final regulations pursuant to HIPAA providing standards for the       assignment of a unique national identifier for providers must be implemented       by       May, 2007. CIGNA is implementing the administrative changes, systems       enhancements and training necessary to satisfy these requirements.
With       respect to privacy, federal and state lawmakers and regulators have imposed       privacy standards and an increasing number of non-U.S. jurisdictions are also       imposing privacy requirements. These standards affect how identifiable       information about individuals may be handled, used and disclosed. State       regulators review the       privacy law compliance of insurance companies. States are focusing on the       importance of maintaining privacy of personal information, with 23 states having       enacted privacy incident notification requirements intended to 23 combat       identity theft, and more are expected to follow.
The       business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs, particularly       health care programs, is heavily regulated by federal and state laws and       administrative agencies, such as state departments of insurance and the federal       Departments of Labor and Justice, as well as the courts. See Regulatory and       Industry Developments in the MD&A section of CIGNAs 2005 Annual Report for       additional information.
The       extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in       which       CIGNA conducts its international operations. In many countries, non-U.S.       insurers are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors. These       restrictions may include discriminatory licensing procedures, compulsory       cessions of reinsurance, required localization of records and funds, higher       premium and income taxes, and requirements for local participation in an       insurers ownership.
Depending       upon their nature, CIGNA's investment management activities are subject to       U.S.       federal securities laws, ERISA, and other federal and state laws governing       investment related activities and products. In many cases, the investment       management activities and investments of individual insurance companies are       subject to regulation by multiple jurisdictions.
The       United States Treasury Department issued regulations in 2005 requiring insurance       companies offering specified products to implement appropriate anti-money       laundering compliance programs with respect to those products on or before       May       2, 2006. CIGNA is completing its risk assessment and is preparing to implement       anti-money laundering programs for its affected products to comply with the       regulations.
Federal       regulation and legislation may affect CIGNAs operations in a variety of ways.       In addition to proposals discussed above related to increased regulation of       the       health care industry, current and proposed federal measures that may       significantly affect CIGNAs operations include employee benefit regulation and       tax.
The       economic and competitive effects on CIGNAs business operations of the       legislative and regulatory proposals discussed above will depend upon the final       form any such legislation or regulation may take.

Ratings CIGNA       and       certain of its insurance subsidiaries are rated by nationally recognized rating       agencies. The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.       However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the       opinion of the rating agency, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt       or       payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the       weakest capacity.
Insurance       ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength       of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies.       The       principal agencies that rate CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries characterize their       insurance rating scales as follows:  A.M.                 Best Company, Inc. (A.M. Best), A++ to S (Superior to                 Suspended);  Moodys                 Investors Service (Moodys), Aaa to C (Exceptional to Lowest);  Standard                 & Poors Corp. (S&P), AAA to R (Extremely Strong to                 Regulatory Action); and  Fitch,                 Inc. (Fitch), AAA to D (Exceptionally Strong to Order of                 Liquidation).
As       of       February 21, 2006, the insurance financial strength ratings for CG Life were       as       follows: CG                 Life Insurance                 Ratings (1) A.M.                 Best A- (Excellent, 4 th of                 16) Moodys A3 (Good, 7 th of                 21) S&P A- (Strong, 7 th of                 21) Fitch A (Strong, 6 th of                 24) ________________________ (1) Includes       the rating assigned, the agencys characterization of the rating and the       position of the rating in the agencys rating scale (e.g., CG Lifes rating by       A.M. Best is the 4 th highest       rating awarded in its scale of 16).
As       of       February 21, 2006, the insurance financial strength rating for Life Insurance       Company of North America assigned by A.M. Best was A- (Excellent, 4 th of 16),       and by Moodys was A3 (Good, 7 th of 21).
Debt       ratings are assessments of the likelihood that a company will make timely       payments of principal and interest. The principal agencies that rate CIGNAs       senior debt characterize their rating scales as follows:  Moodys,                 Aaa to C (Exceptional to Lowest);  S&P,                 AAA to D (Extremely Strong to Default);                 and  Fitch,                 AAA to D (Highest to Default).
The       commercial paper rating scales for those agencies are as follows:  Moodys,                 Prime-1 to Not Prime (Superior to Not                 Prime);  S&P,                 A-1+ to D (Extremely Strong to Default);                 and  Fitch,                 F-1+ to D (Very Strong to Distressed).
25 As       of       February 21, 2006, the debt ratings assigned by the following agencies were       as       follows: Debt       Ratings (1) CIGNA       CORPORATION Commercial Senior                 Debt Paper Moodys Baa3 Prime-3 (Adequate, (Acceptable, 10 th of                 21) 3 rd of                 4) S&P BBB A-2 ( Adequate,  ( Good , 9 th of                 22 ) 3 rd of                 7 ) Fitch BBB F-2 ( Good , ( Moderately                 Strong , 9 th of                 24 ) 3 rd of                 7 ) ________________________ (1) Includes       the rating assigned, the agencys characterization of the rating and the       position of the rating in the applicable agencys rating scale.
In       December 2005, Moodys, S&P and A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength,       senior debt and commercial paper ratings of CIGNA and certain of its       subsidiaries and raised the outlook to positive from stable. CIGNA is committed       to maintaining appropriate levels of capital in its subsidiaries to support       ratings of CIGNA that meet customers expectations, and to improving the       earnings of the health care business. Lower ratings at the parent company level       increase the cost to borrow funds. Lower ratings of CG Life could adversely       affect new sales and retention of current business.
26 L.
Miscellaneous Portions       of CIGNAs insurance business are seasonal in nature. Reported claims under       group health products are generally higher in the first quarter.
CIGNA       and       its principal subsidiaries are not dependent on business from one or a few       customers. No customer accounted for 10% or more of CIGNAs consolidated       revenues in 2005. CIGNA and its principal subsidiaries are not dependent on       business from one or a few brokers or agents. In addition, CIGNAs insurance       businesses are generally not committed to accept a fixed portion of the business       submitted by independent brokers and agents, and generally all such business       is       subject to its approval and acceptance.
CIGNA       had       approximately 28,000, 28,600 and 32,700 employees as of December 31, 2005,       2004       and 2003, respectively.
27 Item       1A.
RISK FACTORS CIGNAs       businesses face risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and       elsewhere in this report. These factors represent risks and uncertainties that       could have a material adverse effect on CIGNAs business, results of operations       and financial condition. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones       CIGNA faces. Others that CIGNA does not know about now, or that the Company       does       not now think are significant, may impair its business or the trading price       of       its securities. The following are significant risks identified by CIGNA.
If       CIGNA does not execute on its strategic initiatives, there could be a material       adverse effect on CIGNAs results of operations and in certain situations,       CIGNA's financial condition .
The       future performance of CIGNAs business will depend in large part on CIGNAs       ability to execute effectively and implement its strategic initiatives. These       initiatives include: executing CIGNA's consumerism strategy, including designing       products to meet emerging market trends and ensuring that an appropriate       infrastructure is in place to meet the needs of customers and members;       continuing to reduce medical costs; and further improving the efficiency of       operations, including lowering operating costs and enabling higher value       services.
Successful       execution of these initiatives depends on a number of factors including:  the                 ability to gain and retain customers and members by providing appropriate                 levels of support and service for CIGNAs products, as well as avoiding                 service and health advocacy related                 errors;  the                 ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees;  the                 negotiation of favorable and standardized provider                 contracts;  the                 identification and introduction of the proper mix or integration                 of                 products that will be accepted by the marketplace;                 and  the                 ability of CIGNAs products and services to differentiate CIGNA from its                 competitors and of CIGNA to demonstrate that these products and services                 (such as disease management and health advocacy programs, provider                 credentialing and other quality care initiatives) result in improved                 health outcomes and reduced costs.
Further, CIGNAs       success will depend upon its ability to develop new systems and enhance the       performance of its existing procedures and processes to adequately support       CIGNA's operations, strategies and business objectives.
If       CIGNA fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data or to strategically       implement new information systems, there could be a material adverse effect       on       CIGNAs business.
CIGNAs       business depends on effective information systems and the integrity and       timeliness of the data it uses to run its business. CIGNAs business strategy       requires providing members and providers with internet or e-business related       products and information to meet their needs. CIGNAs ability to adequately       price its products and services, establish reserves, provide effective and       efficient service to its customers, and to timely and accurately report its       financial results also depends significantly on the integrity of the data in       its       information systems. If the information CIGNA relies upon to run its businesses       was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if CIGNA were to fail to maintain       effectively its information systems and data integrity, the Company could have       problems with, among other things: operational disruptions; determining       medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; customers,       physicians and other health care providers; regulators; increases in operating       expenses; and retention and attraction of customers .
CIGNA       requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect       and       enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing       changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory       standards, and changing customer preferences. There can be no assurance that       CIGNAs process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support       its operations, integrating new systems and improving service levels will       not       be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the       future.
28 If       premiums are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered       to       members, or if CIGNAs estimates of medical claim reserves for its guaranteed       cost and experience-rated businesses based upon estimates of future medical       claims are inadequate, profitability could decline.
CIGNAs       profitability depends, in part, on its ability to accurately predict and control       future health care costs through underwriting criteria, provider contracting,       utilization management and product design. Premiums in the health benefits       business are generally fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, future cost       increases in excess of medical cost projections reflected in pricing cannot       generally be recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. Although       CIGNA bases the premiums it charges on its estimate of future health care costs       over the fixed premium period, actual costs may exceed what was estimated and       reflected in premiums. Factors that may cause actual costs to exceed premiums       include: medical cost inflation, the introduction of new or costly treatments       and technology and membership mix.
CIGNA       records medical claims reserves for estimated future payments. The Company       continually reviews estimates of future payments relating to medical claims       costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and makes necessary       adjustments to its reserves. However, actual health care costs may exceed what       was estimated.
Unfavorable       claims experience related to workers compensation and personal accident       insurance exposures in CIGNAs Run-off Reinsurance business could result in       losses .
Unfavorable       claims experience related to workers compensation and personal accident       insurance exposures in CIGNAs run-off reinsurance business is possible and       could result in future losses. Further, CIGNA could have losses attributable       to       its inability to recover amounts from retrocessionaires or ceding companies       either due to disputes with the retrocessionaires or ceding companies or their       financial condition. If CIGNAs reserves for amounts recoverable from       retrocessionaires or ceding companies, as well as reserves associated with       underlying reinsurance exposures are insufficient, it could result in       losses.
If       CIGNA fails to manage successfully its outsourcing projects and key vendors,       CIGNAs financial results could be harmed .
CIGNA       takes steps to monitor and regulate the performance of independent third parties       who provide services or to whom the Company delegates selected functions. These       third parties include information technology system providers, independent       practice associations and specialty service providers. These arrangements,       however, may make CIGNAs operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to       satisfy their obligations to the Company, due to CIGNAs failure to adequately       monitor and regulate their performance, changes in their own operations,       financial condition, or other matters outside of CIGNAs control. Certain       legislative authorities have in recent periods discussed or proposed legislation       that would restrict outsourcing and, if enacted, could materially increase       CIGNAs costs. In recent years, certain third parties to whom CIGNA delegated       selected functions, such as specialty services providers, have experienced       legal       and other difficulties, which may subject CIGNA to adverse publicity, increased       costs, decline in quality of service and potential network disruptions, and       in       some cases cause the Company to incur increased claims expense. Further, CIGNA       may not fully realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other       benefits of the outsourcing projects or other relationships it enters into       with       key vendors which could result in substantial costs or other operational or       financial problems that could adversely impact the Companys financial       results.
A       downgrade in the financial strength ratings of CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries       could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business, and a       downgrade in CIGNA's debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds.
Financial       strength, claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating       organizations are an important factor in establishing the competitive position       of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Ratings information by       nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally       used throughout the industry. CIGNA believes the claims paying ability and       financial strength ratings of its principal insurance subsidiaries are an       important factor in marketing its products to certain of CIGNAs customers. In       addition, 29 CIGNA       Corporations debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future       borrowings, and accordingly, its cost of capital. Each of the rating agencies       reviews CIGNAs ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current       ratings will be maintained in the future. In addition, a downgrade of these       ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital and to support business       growth at CIGNAs insurance subsidiaries.
As       of February 21, 2006, the insurance financial strength ratings for CG Life,       the       Company's principal insurance subsidiary, were as follows: CG                   Life Insurance                   Ratings (1) A.M.                   Best A- (Excellent, 4 th of                   16) Moodys A3 (Good, 7 th of                   21) S&P A- (Strong, 7 th of                   21) Fitch A (Strong, 6 th of                   24) ________________________ (1) Includes         the rating assigned, the agencys characterization of the rating and the         position of the rating in the agencys rating scale (e.g., CG Lifes rating by         A.M. Best is the 4 th highest         rating awarded in its scale of 16).
A         description of CIGNA Corporation ratings, other         subsidiary ratings, as well as more information on these ratings, is included         inRatings in Section K beginning on page 25 .
If       CIGNAs program for its guaranteed minimum death benefits contracts fails to       reduce the risk of stock market declines, it could have a material adverse       effect on the Companys financial condition.
As       part       of its run-off reinsurance business, CIGNA reinsured a guaranteed minimum death       benefit under certain variable annuities issued by other insurance companies.       CIGNA adopted a program to reduce equity market risks related to these contracts       by selling domestic and foreign-denominated exchange-traded futures contracts       and foreign currency forward contracts. The purpose of this program is to reduce       the adverse effects of potential future domestic and international stock market       declines on CIGNAs liabilities for these contracts. Under the program,       increases in liabilities under the annuity contracts from a declining market       are       offset by gains on the futures contracts. However, if CIGNA were to have       difficulty in entering into appropriate futures or forward contracts, or stock       market declines expose CIGNA to higher rates of partial surrender (which are       not       covered by the program), there could be a material adverse effect on the       Companys financial condition. See Run-off Reinsurance inSection I on page 20 for more information on the program.
If       actual experience differs significantly from CIGNAs assumptions used in       estimating CIGNAs liabilities for reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum       death benefits or minimum income benefits, it could have a material adverse       effect on CIGNAs consolidated results of operations, and in certain situations,       could have a material adverse effect on CIGNA's financial condition.
CIGNAs       management estimates reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit and minimum       income benefit exposures based on assumptions regarding lapse, partial       surrender, mortality, interest rates, volatility, reinsurance recoverables       and       other considerations, and, for minimum income benefit exposures, annuity income       election rates. These estimates are based on CIGNAs experience and future       expectations. CIGNA monitors actual experience to update these reserve estimates       as necessary. CIGNA regularly evaluates the assumptions used in establishing       reserves and changes its estimates if actual experience or other evidence       suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
Significant       stock market declines could result in increased pension plan expenses and the       recognition of additional pension obligations.
CIGNA       has       a pension plan that covers a large number of current employees and retirees.       Unfavorable investment performance due to significant stock market declines       or       changes in estimates of benefit costs, if significant, could adversely affect       CIGNAs results of operations or financial condition by significantly increasing       its pension plan expenses and obligations .
Significant       changes in market interest rates affect the value of CIGNA's financial       instruments that promise a fixed return and, as such, could have an adverse       effect on CIGNA's results of operations .
As       an       insurer, CIGNA has substantial investment assets that support its policy       liabilities. Generally low levels of interest rates on investments, such as       those experienced in United States financial markets during recent years, have       negatively impacted the level of investment income earned by the Company in       recent periods, and such lower levels of investment income would continue if       these lower interest rates were to continue. Substantially all of the Companys       investment assets are in fixed interest-yielding debt securities of varying       maturities, fixed redeemable preferred securities, mortgage loans and real       estate. The value of these securities can fluctuate significantly with changes       in market conditions.
30 CIGNA       faces risks related to litigation and regulatory       investigations .
CIGNA       is       routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits,       investigations and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of the       business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs, including       benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and disputes regarding       reinsurance arrangements. In addition, CIGNA incurs and likely will continue       to       incur liability for claims related to its health care business, such as failure       to pay for or provide health care, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged,       provider disputes, including disputes over compensation, and claims related       to       self-funded business. Also, there are currently, and may be in the future,       attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the industry. In addition,       CIGNA       is involved in pending and threatened litigation arising out of its run-off       reinsurance and retirement operations.
Court       decisions and legislative activity may increase CIGNAs exposure for any of       these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive       damages may be sought. CIGNA currently has insurance coverage for some of these       potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by       insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not       be       enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages,       such       as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage       for       all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively       expensive in the future.
A       description of material legal actions in which CIGNA is currently involved       is       included under Legal Proceedings in Item 3 on pages 33 and 34 , and Note 20 to CIGNAs 2005 Financial Statements       included in its 2005 Annual Report. The outcome of litigation and other legal       matters is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence       can occur. CIGNA believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters       pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. Nevertheless, it is       possible that resolution of one or more legal matters could result in losses       material to CIGNAs consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial       condition.
CIGNAs       business is subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with       new       regulation, could increase its costs of doing business and could adversely       affect its profitability.
CIGNAs       business is regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels.       The       laws and rules governing CIGNAs business and interpretations of those laws and       rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies       administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force       CIGNA to change how it does business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth,       increase health care, technology and administrative costs including pension       costs and capital requirements, and increase CIGNAs liability in federal and       state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other       actions. CIGNA must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many       of       its products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to       consummate some of its acquisitions and divestitures. Delays in obtaining or       failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce the Companys revenue       or increase its costs.
For       further information on regulatory matters relating to CIGNA, see Regulation in       Section J on page 22 ,and Legal Proceedings in Item       3 on pages 33 and 34 , as well as Regulatory and Industry Developments in the MD&A section of CIGNAs 2005       Annual Report.
CIGNA       faces competitive pressure, particularly price competition, which could reduce       product margins and constrain growth in CIGNAs health care       businesses .
While       health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service quality       of       clinical resources, claims administration services and medical management       programs, and quality and sufficiency of provider networks, CIGNA expects that       price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. CIGNAs customer       contracts are subject to negotiation as customers seek to contain their costs,       and customers may elect to reduce benefits in order to constrain increases       in       their benefit costs. Such an election may result in lower premiums for the       Companys products, although it may also reduce CIGNAs health care costs.       Alternatively, the Companys customers may purchase different types of products       from it that are less profitable, or move to a competitor to obtain more       favorable premiums.
31 In       addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the health       care industry giving rise to speculation and uncertainty regarding the status       of       companies, which potentially can affect marketing efforts and public perception.       Consolidation may make it more difficult for the Company to retain or increase       customers, to improve the terms on which CIGNA does business with its suppliers,       or to maintain its position or increase profitability. Factors such as business       consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices       create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite increasing medical       costs. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act gives banks and other financial       institutions the ability to affiliate with insurance companies, which may lead       to new competitors with significant financial resources in the insurance and       health benefits fields. If CIGNA does not compete effectively in its markets,       if       the Company sets rates too high in highly competitive markets to keep or       increase its market share, if membership does not increase as it expects, or       if       it declines, or if CIGNA loses accounts with favorable medical cost experience       while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical       cost experience, CIGNAs product margins and growth could be adversely       affected.
Public       perception of CIGNA's products and practices as well as of the health benefits       industry, if negative, could reduce enrollment in CIGNAs health benefits       programs.
The       health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can arise       either from perceptions regarding the industry or CIGNA's business practices       or       products. This risk may be increased as CIGNA offers new products, such as       products with limited benefits or an integrated line of products, targeted       at       market segments, beyond those in which CIGNA traditionally has operated.       Negative publicity may a dversely       affect the CIGNA brand and its ability to market its products and services,       which could reduce the number of enrollees in CIGNA's health benefits programs       and adversely affect CIGNAs profitability.
Large-scale       public health epidemics and bio-terrorist activity could cause CIGNAs covered       medical and disability expenses, pharmacy costs and mortality experience to       rise       significantly, and in severe circumstances, could cause operational disruption.
If       widespread public health epidemics such as an influenza pandemic or       bio-terrorist or other attack were to occur, CIGNAs covered medical and       disability expenses, pharmacy costs and mortality experience could rise       significantly, depending on the governments actions and the responsiveness of       public health agencies and insurers. In addition, depending on the severity       of       the situation, a widespread outbreak could curtail economic activity in general,       and CIGNA's operations in particular, which could result in operational and       financial disruption to CIGNA, which among other things may impact the       timeliness of claims and revenue.
CIGNA       faces a wide range of risks, and its success depends on its ability to identify,       prioritize and appropriately manage its enterprise risk       exposure.
As       a       large company operating in a complex industry, CIGNA encounters       a variety of risks as identified in this Risk Factor discussion.       CIGNA devotes       resources to developing enterprise-wide risk management processes, in addition       to the risk management processes within its businesses. Failure to appropriately       identify and manage these risks, as well as the failure to identify and take       advantage of appropriate opportunities, can materially affect CIGNAs       profitability, its ability to retain or grow business, or, in the event of       extreme circumstances, CIGNAs financial condition.

PROPERTIES As       of       March 1, 2006 CIGNA's headquarters will be joining CIGNA Group Insurance, CIGNA       International, portions of CIGNA HealthCare and CIGNA's staff support operations       in leased premises of approximately 450,000 square feet at Two Liberty Place,       Philadelphia. CIGNA HealthCare is the primary occupant of a complex of buildings       owned by CIGNA, aggregating approximately 1.5 million square feet of office       space, located at 900-950 Cottage Grove Road, Bloomfield, Connecticut. In       addition, CIGNA owns or leases office buildings, or parts thereof, throughout       the United States and in other countries. CIGNA believes its properties are       adequate and suitable for its business as presently conducted. For additional       information concerning leases and property, see Notes 2(H) and 18 to CIGNA's       2005 Financial Statements included in its 2005 Annual Report. This paragraph       does not include information on investment properties.
Item       3 .
LEGAL       PROCEEDINGS Multi-district       health care litigation in a Florida federal court against CIGNA and several       competitors, included the federal cases Shane       v. Humana, Inc., et al.
(CIGNA       subsidiaries added as defendants in August 2000) and Mangieri v. CIGNA Corporation (filed       December 7, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Northern District       of Alabama), as well as the Illinois state suit Kaiser and Corrigan v. CIGNA Corporation, et al.
(class       of health care providers certified on March 29, 2001). CIGNA previously       disclosed final, court-approved settlement agreements between CIGNA and both       classes of plaintiffs, the physician class and the non-physician health care       professional class. A dispute with a representative of certain physicians over       administration of their settlement is likely to be resolved in mid 2006.
Beginning       in 2004, CIGNA, other insurance companies and certain insurance brokers received       subpoenas and inquiries from the New York Attorney General, the Connecticut       Attorney General, the Florida Insurance Department and other state regulators       relating to their investigations of broker compensation. CIGNA received a       subpoena in October 2005 from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern       District of California and is providing information to that Office about broker,       Universal Life Resources (ULR). In January 2006, CIGNA received a subpoena       from       the U.S. Department of Labor and is providing information to that Office about       another broker. CIGNA is cooperating with the inquiries and investigations       by       regulators and the U.S. Attorneys Office.
A       case       filed on October 14, 2004, United       Policyholders v. Universal Life Resources, Inc., et al.
,       in the       Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego was       withdrawn on April 26, 2005. This case sought injunctive and monetary relief       for       alleged fraudulent and deceptive business practices under section 17200 of       the       California Code in connection with purportedly undisclosed commissions paid       by       insurers to ULR, and named CIGNA Corporation and Life Insurance Company of       North       America as defendants. A case filed on October 20, 2004, Ronald       Scott Shirley, on behalf of himself and All Others Similarly Situated v.       Universal Life Resources, et al.
,       which       was subsequently recaptioned Cynthia       C. Brandes, On Behalf of Herself and All Others Similarly situated vs. Universal       Life Resources, et. al .       was       dismissed by the plaintiffs on August 29, 2005. This case was a purported class       action suit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District       of California under RICO. It alleged that hidden commissions increased the       cost       of employee benefit plans and sought treble damages and injunctive relief.       CIGNA       Corporation and its subsidiary, Life Insurance Company of North America, were       named among the defendants.
On       November 18, 2004, The       People of the State of California by and through John Garamendi, Insurance       Commissioner of the State of California v. Universal Life Resources, et       al .       was       filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San       Diego alleging that defendants (including CIGNA and several other insurance       holding companies) failed to disclose compensation paid to ULR and that, in       return for the compensation, ULR steered clients to defendants. The plaintiffs       are seeking injunctive relief only.
On       August       1, 2005, two CIGNA subsidiaries, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company       and       Life Insurance Company of North America, were named as defendants in a       consolidated amended complaint filed in In       re       Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation ,       a 33 multi-district       litigation proceeding consolidated in the United States District Court for       the       District of New Jersey. The complaint alleges that brokers and insurers       conspired to hide commissions, increasing the cost of employee benefit plans,       and seeks treble damages and injunctive relief. Numerous insurance brokers       and       other insurance companies are named as defendants.
A       shareholder derivative suit, Coustry       v. Hanway, et al.
nominally       on behalf of CIGNA, filed on February 25, 2005 in the United States District       Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was voluntarily dismissed by       the       plaintiff on January 10, 2006. The complaint alleged breach of fiduciary       duty in connection with alleged concealment of the fact that CIGNA paid       contingent commissions to brokers, and sought damages and equitable relief.
In       late       2002, several purported class action lawsuits were filed against CIGNA and       certain of its officers by individuals seeking to represent a class of       purchasers of CIGNA securities from May 2, 2001 to October 24, 2002. The       complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section       10(b) of, and Rule 10b-5 under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by       misleading CIGNA shareholders with respect to the companys performance during       the class period. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and attorneys fees. In       2003, these suits were consolidated in the United States District Court for       the       Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In       re       CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation .       CIGNAs       motions to dismiss certain claims were granted in 2004 and 2005. In January       2006, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint to conform to Court Orders       dismissing claims related to certain issues and statements.
On       November 7, 2002, a purported shareholder derivative complaint nominally on       behalf of CIGNA was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern       District of Pennsylvania by Evelyn Hobbs. The complaint alleges breaches of       fiduciary duty by CIGNAs directors, including, among other things, their failure to monitor, investigate and oversee Cignas management information       system and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. A similar complaint, filed       on November 19, 2002 in the New Castle County (Delaware) Chancery Court by       Jack       Scott was dismissed by the plaintiff and refiled in the United States District       Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Hobbs and Scott cases       are being coordinated in the United States District Court for the Eastern       District of Pennsylvania by the same judge handling the In       re       CIGNA Corp. Securities Litigation .
On       December 18, 2001, Janice Amara filed a purported class action lawsuit in the       United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against CIGNA       Corporation and the CIGNA Pension Plan on behalf of herself and other similarly       situated participants in the CIGNA Pension Plan who earned certain Plan benefits       prior to 1998. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Plan violated       ERISA by impermissibly conditioning certain post-1997 benefit accruals on the       amount of pre-1998 benefit accruals, that these conditions are not adequately       disclosed to plan participants, and that the Plans cash balance formula       discriminates against older employees. The plaintiffs were granted class       certification on December 20, 2002, and seek equitable relief.
On       August       4, 2004, a complaint captioned New       York v. Express Scripts, Inc., ESI Mail Pharmacy Service, Inc., Connecticut       General Life Insurance Company and CIGNA Life Insurance Company of New       York was       filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint alleges       certain breaches of contract and violations of civil law in connection with       the       management of the prescription drug benefit program under New York States       principal employee health plan, the Empire Plan. CIGNA subsidiaries filed a       motion to dismiss all but the breach of contract claims.
See       Unicover and Other Run-off Reinsurance on page 20 for a       description of legal matters arising out of the run-off reinsurance       operations.
CIGNA       is       routinely involved in numerous claims, lawsuits, regulatory audits,       investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the       ordinary course of the business of administering and insuring employee benefit       programs. An increasing number of claims are being made for substantial       non-economic, extra-contractual or punitive damages. The outcome of litigation       and other legal matters is always uncertain, and outcomes that are not justified       by the evidence can occur. CIGNA believes that it has valid defenses to the       legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously.       Nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or more of the legal matters       currently pending or threatened could result in losses material to 34 CIGNAs       consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial       condition.

Of this amount, up to $600 million may be       used to support an internal reinsurance arrangement and the remaining portion       will serve as an available line of credit commitment for CIGNA.
As       of       December 31, 2005 CIGNA Corporation had $500 million remaining under an       effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange       Commission, which may be issued as debt securities, equity securities or       both.

Note       4 As       of       December 31, 2005, CIGNA Corporation had guarantees and similar agreements       in       place to secure payment obligations or solvency requirements of certain wholly       owned subsidiaries as follows:  CIGNA                 Corporation has arranged for bank letters of credit in support of                 CIGNA                 Global Reinsurance Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary domiciled                 in Bermuda, in the amount of $116 million. These letters of credit                 secure                 the payment of insureds claims from run-off reinsurance operations. CIGNA                 Corporation has agreed to indemnify the banks providing the letters                 of                 credit in the event of any draw. As of December 31, 2005 approximately                 $112 million of the letters of credit are                 issued.
CIGNA                 Corporation has provided a capital commitment deed in an amount up                 to $185                 million in favor of CIGNA Global Reinsurance Company. This deed is                 equal                 to the letters of credit securing the payment of insureds claims from                 run-off reinsurance operations. This deed is required by Bermuda                 regulators to have these letters of credit for the London run-off                 reinsurance operations included as admitted                 assets.
Various                 indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries have obtained surety bonds in                 the                 normal course of business. If there is a claim on a surety bond and                 the                 subsidiary is unable to pay, CIGNA Corporation guarantees payment                 to the                 company issuing the surety bond. The aggregate amount of such surety                 bonds                 as of December 31, 2005 was $50                 million.
CIGNA                 Corporation is obligated under a $25 million letter of credit required                 by                 the insurer of its high-deductible self-insurance programs to indemnify                 the insurer for claim liabilities that fall within deductible amounts                 for                 policy years dating back to 1994.
CIGNA                 Corporation also provides solvency guarantees aggregating $34 million                 under state and federal regulations in support of its indirect wholly                 owned medical HMOs in several states.
CIGNA                 Corporation has arranged a $150 million letter of credit in support                 of                 CIGNA Europe Insurance Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary.                 CIGNA                 Corporation has agreed to indemnify the banks providing the letters                 of                 credit in the event of any draw. CIGNA Europe Insurance Company is                 the                 holder of the letters of credit.
In                 addition, CIGNA Corporation has agreed to indemnify payment of losses                 included in CIGNA Europe Insurance Companys reserves on the reinsurance                 business transferred from ACE. As of December 31, 2005, the reserve                 was                 $452 million.
Through       December 31, 2005, no payments have been made on these guarantees and none       are       pending. CIGNA Corporation provided other guarantees to subsidiaries that,       in       the aggregate, do not represent a material risk to CIGNA Corporations results       of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
