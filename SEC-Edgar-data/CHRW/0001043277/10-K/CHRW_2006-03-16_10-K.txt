PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview Founded in 1905, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (the Company or Robinson) is one of the largest third-party logistics companies in North America with 2000 gross revenues of $2.9 billion. The Company is a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions through a network of 137 offices in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and South America. Through contracts with approximately 20,000 motor carriers, Robinson maintains the single largest network of motor carrier capacity in North America and is one of the largest third-party providers of intermodal services in the United States. In addition, Robinson regularly provides air, ocean and customs services. As an integral part of its transportation services, Robinson provides a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as fresh produce sourcing, freight consolidation, information reporting and cross-docking. During 2000, Robinson handled over 2,300,000 shipments for more than 14,000 customers ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries.
Robinson has developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide. As a result, the Company has the capability of managing all aspects of the supply chain on behalf of its customers. As a non-asset based transportation provider, Robinson can focus on optimizing the transportation solution for its customer rather than on its own asset utilization, using established relationships with motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight carriers and ocean carriers.
Throughout its 95-year history, the Company has been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of Robinsons logistics expertise can be traced to its significant experience in handling perishable commodities. Due to the time-sensitive nature and quality requirements of the shipments, fresh produce represents a unique logistics challenge, and the distribution and transportation costs are significant. Robinson has developed a network of produce sources and maintains access to specialized equipment and transportation modes designed to ensure timely delivery of uniform quality produce. In response to demand from large grocery retailers and food service distributors, the Company has developed its own brand of produce, The Fresh 1, and entered into licensing agreements for national brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements.
Robinsons business philosophy has accounted for its strong historical results and has positioned the Company for continued growth. The Companys principal competitive advantage is its large decentralized branch network, staffed by approximately 2,590 salespersons who are employees rather than agents. These branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and carriers, which facilitates quick responses to customers changing needs. Branch employees act as a team in both marketing Robinsons services and providing these services to individual customers. Robinson compensates its branch employees principally on the basis of individual performance and their branchs profitability, which in the Companys opinion produces a more service-oriented, focused and creative sales force. The Company believes more than 1,000 of its employees hold approximately half of the Companys Common Stock.
The Company was reincorporated in Delaware in 1997 as the successor to a business existing, in various legal forms, since 1905. Robinsons Common Stock began trading on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol CHRW on October 15, 1997. Certain stockholders of the Company sold 24,330,310 shares of the Companys Common Stock to the public pursuant to a registered public offering, the proceeds of which were paid entirely to the selling stockholders. Prior to such date, there was no established public trading market for the Companys Common Stock.
In August 2000, the Company acquired the ongoing operations and certain assets of Trans-Consolidated, Inc., a privately held, non-asset based third-party refrigerated less-than-truckload transportation provider, located in Brooklyn Center, MN. Trans-Consolidated had annual net revenues of approximately $3,200,000 in 1999.
In October 2000, the Companys Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, paid on December 1, 2000 to stockholders of record on November 10, 2000. This was the first Robinson stock split since the Companys initial public offering.
-1- Robinsons corporate office is located at 8100 Mitchell Road, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344-2248, and its telephone number is (952) 937-8500. Its web site address is www.chrobinson.com.
Logistics Services As a global, third-party logistics company, Robinson provides multimodal transportation and related logistics services, sourcing and fee-based information services.
The Company seeks to establish long-term relationships with its customers in order to provide logistics solutions that reduce or eliminate inefficiencies in customers supply chains. Whenever appropriate, Robinson analyzes the customers current transportation rate structures, modes of shipping and carrier selection. Robinson may also examine the customers warehousing, picking procedures, loading, unloading and dock scheduling procedures, as well as packaging and pallet configuration procedures. The Company then evaluates how these procedures interact with shipping, manufacturing and customer service. Upon completion of an initial analysis, Robinson proposes solutions that allow the customer to streamline operating procedures and contain costs, while improving the management of its supply chain. Robinson branch employees remain involved with the customer throughout the analysis and implementation of the proposed solution. In the course of providing day-to-day transportation services, branch employees offer further logistics analysis and solutions as the employees become more familiar with the customers daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain. The Companys ultimate goal is to assist the customer in managing its entire supply chain while being the customers key provider of individual transportation services.
Multimodal Transportation Services On a day-to-day basis, customers communicate their freight needs, typically on a load-by-load basis, to Robinson by means of a telephone call, fax transmission, Internet, e-mail or EDI message to the branch office salesperson responsible for the particular customer. All appropriate information about each load is entered into the Companys computer based operating system. With the help of the operating system, a salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the load and selects a carrier or carriers, based upon the salespersons knowledge of the carriers service capability, equipment availability, freight rates and other relevant factors. A salesperson then communicates with the carriers dispatch office to confirm a price for the transportation and the carriers commitment to provide the transportation. At this point, the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer, together with the Companys sales price, which is intended to provide a profit to Robinson for the totality of services performed for the customer. By accepting the customers order, Robinson becomes legally responsible for transportation of the load from origin to destination, rather than being a mere freight broker. The carriers contract is with Robinson, not the customer, and Robinson is responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges. Robinson is also responsible to its customer for any claims for damage to freight while in transit or performance. In most cases, Robinson receives reimbursement from the carrier for these claims.
As a result of its logistics capabilities, many customers now look to Robinson to handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center. In a number of instances, Robinson has contracts with the customer whereby Robinson agrees to handle a specified number of loads usually to specified destinations, such as from the customers plant to a distribution center, at specific rates, but subject to seasonal variation. Most of the Companys rate commitments are for periods of one year or less. To meet its obligations under these customer contracts, Robinson may obtain advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport all, or a significant portion, of the contracted loads, again at specific rates, for the length of Robinsons customer contract.
As part of its customer focus, Robinson offers a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis to assure timely, efficient and cost effective delivery through the use of one or more transportation modes. These logistics services include: transportation management (price and modal comparisons and selection; shipment consolidation and optimization; improvement of operating and shipping procedures and claims management); minimization of storage (through cross-docking and other flow-through operations); logistics network and nodal location analysis to optimize the entire supply chain; tracking and tracing; reverse logistics and other special needs; management information; and analysis of a customers risk and claims management practices. Robinson will evaluate a customers core carrier program by reviewing such factors as carriers insurance certificates, safety ratings and financial stability as well as establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers. These services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically -2- separately priced, but instead are reflected as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by the Company on a transactional basis pursuant to continuing customer relationships. In addition to these transportation services, Robinson may supply sourcing, contract warehousing, consulting and other services, for which it is separately compensated.
The Company is capable of arranging all modes of transportation services on a worldwide basis: Truck  Through its contracts with approximately 20,000 motor carriers, Robinson maintains access to dry vans, temperature-controlled units and flatbeds. It offers both time-definite and expedited truck transportation. In many instances, particularly in connection with its sourcing business, the Company will consolidate partial loads for several customers into full truckloads.
Less Than Truckload (LTL)  LTL transportation involves the shipment of small package, single or multiple pallet, up to and including full trailer-load freight. Robinson focuses on pallet to partial load freight, although it handles any size shipment. Through contracts with motor carriers and its proprietary Internet-based software system, Robinson consolidates both freight and freight information to provide shippers with single source tracking and tracing capability, and the economic benefits of consolidating partial loads into full truckloads.
Intermodal  Intermodal transportation involves the shipment of trailers or containers by a combination of truck, rail and/or ship in a coordinated manner. Robinson provides intermodal service by both rail and ship, arranges local pickup and delivery (known as drayage) through local motor carriers and provides temperature-controlled double and triple-stacked intermodal containers. The Company currently owns or leases approximately 500 intermodal containers. Robinson also has intermodal marketing contracts with railroads, which give the Company access to additional trailers and containers.
Ocean  As an indirect ocean carrier and freight forwarder, Robinson consolidates shipments, determines routing, selects ocean carriers, contracts for ocean shipments, provides for local pickup and delivery of shipments and arranges for customs clearance of shipments, including the payment of duties.
Air  The Company provides door-to-door service as a full-service air freight forwarder, both domestically and internationally.
The table below shows the Companys net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated: Transportation Net Revenues (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Truck(1) $ 110,460 $ 133,110 $ 164,186 $ 202,877 $ 313,650 Intermodal 8,014 9,680 6,671 10,738 14,422 Ocean 8,121 9,226 10,215 11,476 16,337 Air 1,687 1,954 3,427 2,858 3,555 Miscellaneous(2) 4,964 5,290 5,298 5,899 7,177 Total $ 133,246 $ 159,260 $ 189,797 $ 233,848 $ 355,141 (1) Includes LTL net revenues.
(2) Consists of customs clearance (Automated Brokerage Interface (ABI) and Automated Clearing House (ACH) capabilities with the U.S. Customs Service), warehousing, and other miscellaneous services.
As Robinson has emphasized integrated logistics solutions, its relationships with many customers have become broader, with the Company becoming a business partner responsible for a greater portion of supply chain management. Customers may be served by specially created Robinson teams and through several branches.
-3- Robinsons multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through its domestic branch offices as well as through branch offices in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. The Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements present Robinsons gross revenues from international customers for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and the Companys long-lived assets as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, in the United States and in foreign locations.
Sourcing Throughout its 95-year history, Robinson has been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of the Companys logistics expertise can be traced to Robinsons significant experience in handling perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, produce must be quickly packaged, transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and distributed quickly to replenish high turnover inventories maintained by wholesalers, food service companies and retailers. In most instances, Robinson consolidates individual customers produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arranges for transportation of the truckloads, often to multiple destinations. The Companys sourcing business is with produce wholesalers, who purchase produce in relatively large quantities through Robinson and resell the produce to grocery retailers, restaurants and other resellers of food, and with grocery store chains and other multistore retailers. Most of Robinsons remaining customers are food service companies that distribute a range of food products to retailers, restaurants and institutions.
During the past five years, the Company has actively sought to expand its food sourcing customer base by focusing on the larger multistore retailers. As these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation, their traditional methods of produce sourcing and store-level distribution, which relied principally on regional or even local purchases from wholesalers, have become inefficient. Robinsons logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can greatly improve the retailers produce purchasing as well as assure uniform quality from region to region and store to store. The Company provides just-in-time replenishment services to retailers. The Company introduced its proprietary The Fresh 1 brand of produce in 1989, which includes a wide range of uniform quality, top grade fruits and vegetables purchased from various domestic and international growers. During 1998, Robinson entered into new sourcing programs, including licensing agreements for major national brands, that have expanded the Companys market presence and sourcing capabilities with respect to both product lines and nationally recognized brand names.
Sourcing accounted for approximately 18%, 15% and 10% of the Companys net revenues in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
Information Services A subsidiary of the Company, T-Chek Systems, Inc. provides motor carrier customers with funds transfer and driver payroll services, fuel management services, fuel and use tax reporting as well as on-line access to custom-tailored information management reports, all through the use of its proprietary automated system. This system enables motor carriers to track equipment, manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel. For several companies and truck stop chains, T-Chek captures sales and fuel cost data, applies the margin agreed between seller and purchaser, reprices the sale, invoices the carrier and provides management information to the seller.
Through its subsidiary, Payment & Logistics Services, Inc., the Company provides freight payment services to shippers using a proprietary system, often linked to the carriers by EDI, with the ability to process freight payments by electronic funds transfer. This system also enables Robinson to automatically audit the customers freight rates, eliminate duplicate payments to carriers and produce reports containing information about such matters as shipping patterns, freight volumes and overall transportation costs. Upon agreement, the Company and the customer can use this data to better manage the customers supply chain. Robinson is not actively trying to grow this business. Freight payment and audit is an extremely competitive industry, requiring large volumes of business to be profitable. Robinson has continued in this business primarily as an added service to those customers who request it.
The Companys information services accounted for approximately 5%, 6% and 5% of the Companys net revenues in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
-4- Organization To allow the Company to stay close to customers and markets, Robinson has created and continues to expand a network of 137 offices supported by executives and services in a central office.
Branch Network Branch salespersons are responsible for developing new business, receiving and processing orders from specific customers and customers located in the area served by the branch and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested. In addition to routine transportation, salespersons are often called upon to handle customers unusual, seasonal and emergency needs. Shipments to be transported by truck are almost always contracted at the branch level, and branches cooperate with each other to cover loads. Some branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting LTL, intermodal, international and air shipments.
Salespersons in the branches both sell and service their customers rather than rely exclusively on a central office or dedicated sales staff. Sales opportunities are identified through the Companys database, industry directories, referrals by existing customers and leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets. Each branch is also responsible for locating and contracting with carriers.
The table below shows certain information about the Companys branches for the periods indicated: Branch Data (Dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Average employees per branch 15.4 16.2 18.4 23.9 26.8 Average net revenues per branch $ 1,717 $ 1,822 $ 2,082 $ 2,263 $ 3,148 Average net revenues per employee $ 115 $ 115 $ 119 $ 120 $ 122 As of December 31, 2000, Robinsons branch salespersons represented approximately 71% of the Companys total work force and all branch employees, including support staff, represented over 84% of the Companys work force. At December 31, 2000, the number of salespersons per Company branch ranged from three to approximately 450 (including salespersons and customer support at American Backhaulers).
Branch Expansion.
Robinson expects to continue to add branch offices as management determines that a new branch may contribute to continued growth and as branch salespersons develop the capability to manage a new branch. Robinson intends to continue to open overseas branches as opportunities arise to serve the local needs of multinational customers. Additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch, such as within major cities, as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch. Capital required to open a new branch is modest, involving a lease for a small amount of office space, communication links and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time.
Branch Employees.
For almost two decades, new branch salespersons have been hired through a sophisticated profiling system using standardized tests to measure an applicant against the traits determined by the Company to be those of successful Robinson employees. These common traits facilitate cooperative efforts necessary for the success of each office. Applicants are recruited nationally from across the United States and Canada, typically have college degrees and some have business experience, not necessarily within the transportation industry. The Company is highly selective in determining to whom it offers employment.
Newly hired branch employees receive extensive on-the-job training at the branch level, which ranges from six months to a year and emphasizes development of the necessary skills and attitude to become productive members of a branch team. The Company believes most salespersons become productive employees in a matter of weeks. After gaining approximately a year of experience, each salesperson attends a Company-sponsored national meeting to receive additional training and foster relationships between branches.
Employees at the branch level form a team, which is enhanced by Robinsons incentive compensation system. Under this system, part of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespersons is dependent -5- on the profitability of the particular branch or business unit. For any calendar year, branch managers and salespersons who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branchs earnings for that calendar year, based on a system of points awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contribution. Most of a branch managers cash compensation is provided by this compensation program. For 2000, incentive-based cash compensation averaged approximately 35% of branch salespersons total cash compensation, 64% of branch managers total cash compensation and 64% of officers total cash compensation. Branch employees can earn significant individual incentive compensation based on achieving individual growth goals, and in the Companys Profit Sharing Plan, contributions that depend on overall Company profitability and other factors. In connection with establishing new branches and other special circumstances, Robinson may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons.
All managers and other employees throughout the Company who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in the Companys 1997 Omnibus Stock Plan. Employees at all levels, after a qualifying period of employment, are eligible to participate in the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Individual salespersons benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals, and are motivated by the opportunity to become branch managers, assistant managers or department managers. All branch salespersons are full time employees.
Executive Officers Under the Companys decentralized operating system, branch managers report directly to, and receive guidance and support from, a small group of executive officers at the Companys central office. Customers, carriers, managers and employees have direct access to the Companys Chief Executive Officer, D.R. Verdoorn, and all other executive officers. These executives provide training and education concerning logistics, develop new services and applications to be offered to customers and provide broad market analysis.
The executive officers of the Company serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are chosen annually by the Board of Directors. Set forth below are the names, ages and positions of the executive officers of the Company.

-7- Robinson believes that its compensation and benefit plans are among the most competitive in the industry and that its relationship with employees is excellent.
Customers and Marketing Robinson seeks to establish long-term relationships with its customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by seeking to provide the customer with a full range of logistics services. The Company serves 14,000 customers worldwide ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries. During 2000, no customer accounted for more than 8% of gross revenues or 4% of net revenues. In recent years, revenue growth has been achieved through the growth and consolidation of customers, expansion of the services provided by the Company and an increase in the number of customers served.
Robinson believes that decentralization allows salespersons to better serve its customers by fostering the development of a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers. With the guidance of experienced branch managers (who have an average tenure of 12 years with the Company), branches are given significant latitude in pursuing opportunities and committing the Companys resources to serve customers.
Branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers, based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that the Company is capable of providing. Robinson has begun placing increased emphasis on national sales and marketing support to enhance branch capabilities. Increasingly, branches call on central office executives, a national sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements.
Relationships with Carriers Robinson seeks to establish long-term relationships with carriers in order to assure dependable services, favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods of undercapacity. To strengthen and maintain these relationships, Company salespersons regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and seek to assist carriers with equipment utilization, reduction of empty miles and equipment repositioning. The Company has a policy of prompt payment and provides centralized claims management on behalf of various shippers. Many smaller carriers effectively consider Robinson as their sales and marketing department.
As of December 31, 2000, Robinson had contracts with approximately 20,000 motor carriers (providing access to temperature controlled vans, dry vans and flatbeds). Those carriers include owner-operators of a single truck, small and mid-size fleets, private fleets and the largest national trucking companies. Consequently, the Company is not dependent on any one carrier. As of December 31, 2000, Robinson also had intermodal marketing contracts with railroads, including all of the major North American railroads, giving the Company access to additional trailers and containers. Robinson qualifies each motor carrier to assure that it is properly licensed and insured and has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis. The Companys motor carrier contracts require that the carrier commit to a minimum number of shipments, issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from Robinson and permit Robinson to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages. Carrier contracts also establish transportation rates that can be modified by issuance of an individual load confirmation. The Companys contracts with railroads govern the transportation services and payment terms by which Robinsons intermodal shipments are transported by rail. Intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between the Company and the railroad on a customer-specific basis.
Competition The transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. The Company competes primarily against a large number of other non-asset based logistics companies, as well as asset-based logistics companies, third-party freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders. Robinson also competes against carriers internal sales forces and shippers own transportation departments. It also buys and sells transportation services from and to companies with which it competes.
The Company often competes with respect to price, scope of services or a combination thereof, but believes that its most significant competitive advantages are: -8- its large decentralized branch network, staffed by salespersons who are employees rather than agents, which enables the Companys salespersons to gain significant knowledge about individual customers, carriers and the local and regional markets they serve, its technology, including Internet communications capabilities, its ability to provide a broad range of logistics services and its ability to provide door-to-door services on a worldwide basis.
Communications and Information Systems To handle the large number of daily transactions and to accommodate its decentralized branch system, the Company has designed an extensive communications and information system. Employees are linked with each other and with customers and carriers by telephone, facsimile, Internet, e-mail and/or EDI to communicate requirements and availability, to confirm and bill orders and, through the Companys Internet home page CHRW e-Center (www.chrobinson.com), to contract loads or equipment and track and trace shipments. Customers and carriers also have access to Robinsons systems through the CHRW e-Center. The Company has developed its own proprietary computer based systems that help salespersons service customer orders, select the optimal modes of transportation, build and consolidate loads and selects routes, all based on customer-specific service parameters, makes load data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers, enabling the salespersons to select carriers and track loads in progress, and automatically provides visible alerts to any arising problems. Robinsons internally developed proprietary decision support system uses data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports which are available to the Companys logistics customers to provide information on traffic patterns, product mix and production schedules, and enables customers to analyze their own customer base, transportation expenditure trends and the impact on out-of-route and out-of-stock costs.
Government Regulation The transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry.
Robinson is subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation provider. The Company is licensed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as a broker in arranging for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. The Company provides motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the DOT and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the DOT, including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts. The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission as an ocean freight forwarder and maintains a non-vessel operating common carrier bond. The Company operates as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the DOT. The Company provides customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the United States Customs Service of the Department of Treasury. The Company sources fresh produce under a license issued by the United States Department of Agriculture. Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations. Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight, the Company and several of its subsidiaries continue to be subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements. The Company and the carriers that the Company relies on in arranging transportation services for its customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations. Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on the Companys operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact the Companys operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject the Company to fines or, in the event of serious violation, suspension or revocation of operating authority as well as increased claims liability.
-9- Risk Management and Insurance In its truck and intermodal operations, Robinson assumes full value cargo risk to its customers. The Company subrogates its losses against the motor or rail carrier with the transportation responsibilities. Robinson requires all motor carriers participating in its contract program to carry at least $100 million in general liability insurance and $25,000 in cargo insurance. Many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums. Railroads, which are generally self-insured, provide limited common carrier liability protection, generally up to $250,000 per shipment. For both truck and rail transportation, higher coverage is available to the customer on a load-by-load basis at an additional price.
In its international freight forwarding, ocean transportation and air freight businesses, the Company does not assume cargo liability to its customers above minimum industry standards. Robinson offers its customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit. When the Company agrees to store goods for its customers for longer terms, it provides limited warehousemans coverage to its customers and contracts for warehousing services from companies that provide Robinson the same degree of coverage.
The Company maintains a broad cargo liability policy to protect it against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier. Robinson also carries various liability policies, including auto and general liability, with a $100 million umbrella.
Agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. Concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination has led to recalls of products, and tort claims have been brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. Because the Company is a seller of produce, it may have legal responsibility arising from sales of produce. While the Company carries product liability coverage of $75 million, settlement of class action claims is often costly, and Robinson cannot assure that its liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available. In addition, in connection with any recall, Robinson may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing, transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, for which it is not insured. Any recall or allegation of contamination could affect the Companys reputation, particularly of its the Fresh 1 brand. Loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine part of the sourcing business.
