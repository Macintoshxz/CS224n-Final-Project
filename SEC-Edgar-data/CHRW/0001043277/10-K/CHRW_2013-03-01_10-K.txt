PART I ITEM1.
BUSINESS Overview C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (C.H. Robinson, the company, we, us, or our) is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2007 gross revenues of $7.3 billion. We provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes, in a wide variety of industries. During 2007, including our transportation management services business, we handled approximately 6.5million shipments for more than 29,000 customers. We operate through a network of 218 offices, which we call branches, in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. We have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide. As a result, we have the capability of managing most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers.
We are a non-asset based transportation provider, meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers freight. Through our relationships with approximately 48,000 transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight and ocean carriers, we select and hire the appropriate transportation to manage our customers freight needs. Being non-asset based means we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers, rather than focusing on asset utilization. As an integral part of our transportation services, we provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as supply chain analysis, freight consolidation, core carrier program management, and information reporting.
In addition to multimodal transportation services, we have two other logistics business lines: fresh produce sourcing and fee-based information services.
Sourcing (the buying, selling, and marketing of fresh produce) was our original business when we were founded in 1905. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities. We purchase fresh produce through our network of independent produce suppliers. Our customers include regional and national grocery retailers and restaurants, produce wholesalers, and foodservice distributors. In most cases, we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment. We have developed our own brands of produce including, The Fresh 1  and OurWorld  organics, and also have entered into licensing agreements to distribute produce under other national brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our sourcing business.
Information Services, our third business line, is comprised of a C.H. Robinson subsidiary, T-Chek Systems, Inc. T-Cheks customers are primarily motor carriers, for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as fuel management services, funds transfer, permit procurement, fuel and use tax reporting, and driver funds transfer. For several companies and truck stop chains, T-Chek captures sales and fuel cost data, provides management information to the seller, transfers funds to the truck stop, and invoices the carrier for fuel, cash advances, and our fee.
Our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth. One of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 218 offices, staffed by approximately 5,700 salespeople. These branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers, which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers and transportation providers changing needs. Employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and operations. Approximately 30% of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches. Our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers. For large multi-location customers, we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs. Our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches. Our North American branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate with other branch locations, and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction. A significant portion of our branch employees compensation is performance-oriented, based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch. We believe this makes our sales employees more service-oriented, focused, and creative.
Historically we have grown primarily through internal growth, by expanding current offices, opening new branch offices, and hiring additional salespeople. We have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions. In July 2007, we completed the acquisition of LXSI Services, Inc., a third-party domestic air and expedited services provider based in Los Angeles, California. LXSI had gross revenues of approximately $25 million in 2006.
Multimodal Transportation Services C.H. Robinson is a third party logistics company. We provide freight transportation and logistics services. We are a non-asset based provider, meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight. We make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them, and what we pay to the transportation provider to handle or transport the freight.
We can arrange all of the following modes of transportation:  Truck  Through our contracts with motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature-controlled units, and flatbeds. We also offer time-definite and expedited truck transportation. In many instances, we will consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads.
Less Than Truckload (LTL)  LTL transportation involves the shipment of small packages and single or multiple pallets of freight, up to and including full trailer-load freight. We focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor carriers and our operating system, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight.
Intermodal  C.H. Robinsons intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers, by a combination of truck and rail. We have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners, stacktrain operators, and all Class 1 railroads in North America, and we arrange local pickup and delivery (known as drayage) through local contracted motor carriers.
Ocean  As a non-asset based ocean carrier and freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments, and arrange for customs clearance of shipments, including the payment of duties.
Air  We provide door-to-door service as a full-service air freight forwarder.
Customers communicate their freight needs, typically on a shipment-by-shipment basis, to the branch salesperson responsible for their account. Customers communicate with us by means of telephone, fax, Internet, e-mail, or EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). The branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system. With the help of information provided by the operating system, the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the shipment and selects a carrier or carriers, based upon his or her knowledge of the carriers service capability, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. Based on the information he or she has about the market and rates, the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point, or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price. In many cases, employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate carrier for our customers freight, and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split.
Once the carrier is selected, the salesperson communicates with the carrier to agree on the price for the transportation and the carriers commitment to provide the transportation. We are in contact with the carrier through numerous means of communication (EDI, CHRWTrucks.com  , e-mail, verbal) to provide tracking and status updates of the shipment through delivery. Our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer.
We are a principal in the transaction. By accepting the customers order, we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The carriers contract is with us, not the customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges. In the cases where we have agreed (either contractually or otherwise) to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we pursue reimbursement from the carrier for the claims.
As a result of our logistics capabilities, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center. In a number of instances, we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated, approximate number of shipments usually to specified destinations, such as from the customers plant to a distribution center. Our commitment to handle the shipments is usually at specific rates, subject to seasonal variation. Most of our rate commitments are for one year or less. As is typical in the transportation industry, most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments, which are sometimes called must haul requirements.
The majority of our truckload freight is priced to our carriers on a spot market, or transactional, basis, even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis. In a small number of cases, we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport contracted shipments, for the length of our customer contract.
In the course of providing day-to-day transportation services, our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain. We offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies. We will analyze the customers current transportation rate structures, modes of shipping, and carrier selection. We can 3 evaluate a customers core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers. We can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings. We will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures, and manage claims. We can help customers minimize storage through cross-docking and other flow-through operations. We may also examine the customers warehousing and dock procedures. Many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately. They are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us, based on the nature of the customer relationship. In addition to these transportation services, we may supply sourcing, contract warehousing, consulting, fee-based transportation management, and other services, for which we are usually paid separately.
As we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions, our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become key providers to our customers, responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management. We may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches. Our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network. See Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 and our long-lived assets as of December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 in the United States and in foreign locations.
The table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated: Transportation Gross Profits (in thousands) Year Ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Truck(1) $ 949,277 $ 822,954 $ 666,605 $ 501,940 $ 401,709 Intermodal 38,670 36,176 31,392 29,960 28,103 Ocean 43,530 37,150 29,182 20,558 19,027 Air 31,315 21,533 13,321 8,570 4,891 Miscellaneous(2) 35,240 28,152 19,824 14,709 10,973 Total $ 1,098,032 $ 945,965 $ 760,324 $ 575,737 $ 464,703 (1) Includes LTL gross profits.
(2) Consists of fee-based transportation management services, customs clearance (Automated Brokerage Interface (ABI) and Automated Clearing House (ACH) capabilities with the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection), warehousing, and other miscellaneous services.
Transportation services accounted for approximately 88% of our gross profits in 2007 and 87% in 2006 and 2005.
Sourcing Throughout our 102-year history, we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, produce must be rapidly packaged, carefully transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment, and quickly distributed to replenish high-turnover inventories maintained by retailers, wholesalers, foodservice companies, and restaurants. In many instances, we consolidate individual customers produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads, often to multiple destinations.
For several years, we have actively sought to expand our Sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers, restaurant chains and foodservice providers. Historically, grocery retailers have relied primarily on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and store-level distribution. As these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation, these methods have become inefficient. Our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers produce purchasing, and provide consistent quality from region to region and store to store.
Our Sourcing services have expanded to include just-in-time replenishment, commodity management and business analysis. We have various national and regional branded produce programs, including both proprietary brands (The Fresh 1, Freshn Easy, Our World Organics, Tropic Sweet, Tomorrows Organics, and Kensington Farms) and licensed brands (Motts, Tropicana, Welchs, Glory Foods and Bambino). These programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality. These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers. We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred supplier programs.
4 Sourcing accounted for approximately 8% of our gross profits in 2007 and 9% in 2006 and 2005.
Information Services Information Services is comprised of a subsidiary of C.H. Robinson, T-Chek Systems, Inc. T-Cheks customers are primarily motor carriers and truck stop chains. T-Chek provides its motor carrier customers with fuel management services, funds transfer, fuel and use tax reporting, driver payroll services, permits, and on-line access to custom-tailored information management reports, all through the use of its proprietary automated systems. These systems enable motor carriers to track equipment, manage fleets, and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel. For several companies and truck stop chains, T-Chek captures sales and fuel cost data, provides management information to the seller, and invoices the carrier for fuel, cash advances, and our fee.
Information Services accounted for approximately 4% of our gross profits in 2007, 2006, and 2005.
Organization To keep us close to our customers and markets, we operate through a network of offices, which we call branches. We currently have 218 branches, up from 214 in 2006. Our branches are supported by executives and other centralized, shared services. Approximately 10% of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized, shared services. Over one-third of these corporate employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network.
Branch Network We currently have branches in the following areas of the world: Continent Number of Branches North America 170 Europe 27 Asia 17 South America 4 Each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability. Our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business, negotiating and pricing services, receiving and processing service requests from customers, and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested. In addition to routine transportation, salespeople are often called upon to handle customers unusual, seasonal, and emergency needs. Shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level, and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers to provide transportation. Branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting LTL, intermodal, international ocean and air shipments. Multiple branches may also work together to service larger, national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customers needs. Their efforts are usually coordinated by one lead branch on the account.
Salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers. Sales opportunities are identified through our database, referrals from current customers, leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets, and third party sources such as industry directories. Salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers, who are qualified by our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured, and have the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis.
Branch Expansion.
We expect to continue to open new branch offices. New branch offices are viewed as a long-term contributor to overall company growth. In addition to market opportunity, a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch. Additional branches are often opened within a geographic area previously served by another branch, such as within major cities, as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch. A modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch, usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space, communications and hardware, and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time. We have also augmented our branch office network through selective acquisitions.
5 Branch Employees.
Because the quality of our employees is essential to our success, we are highly selective in our hiring. We recruit applicants from across North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. Our applicants typically have college degrees, and some have business experience, although not necessarily within the transportation industry.
Early in their tenure, most newly hired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team. Centralized training is followed by ongoing, on-the-job training at the branch level. We expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks. In addition, each new salesperson attends an orientation within their first year of employment to further their knowledge of the company and have the opportunity to develop relationships with employees of other branches.
Employees at the branch level form a team. The team structure is motivated by our performance-based compensation system, in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch or business unit. Branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branchs earnings for that calendar year, based on a system of points awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contributions. Employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our 401(k) plan. In some special circumstances, such as opening new branches, we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time.
All of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 Omnibus Stock Plan. Within that plan, in 2003 we began regularly issuing restricted stock and restricted stock units as our primary equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long term ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders. For most restricted stock awards, restricted shares and units are available to vest over five calendar years, based on company performance.
Individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals. They are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths, including branch management, national sales, and national account management. We have a promote from within philosophy, and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees.
Executive Officers Under our decentralized business structure, branch managers, while retaining autonomy for their branch performance, receive guidance and support from the executive officers at our central corporate office. Customers, carriers, managers, and employees have direct access to our chief executive officer, John Wiehoff, and all other executive officers. These executives provide training and education, develop new services and applications to be offered to customers, share operations and management guidance, and provide broad market analysis.
The executives are designated annually by the Board of Directors. Below are the names, ages, and positions of the executive officers: Name Age Position John P. Wiehoff 46 Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board James E. Butts 52 Senior Vice President Linda U. Feuss 51 Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary James P.

Employees As of December31, 2007, we had a total of 7,332 employees, of whom approximately 6,600 were located in our branch offices. Services such as accounting, information technology, legal, marketing communications, human resource support, credit and claims management, and carrier services are supported centrally.
Customers and Marketing We seek to establish long-term relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services. During 2007, we served over 29,000 customers worldwide, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries. During 2007, no customer accounted for more than 6% of gross revenues or 3% of gross profits. In recent years, we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with, and providing more services to, our existing customers.
We believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions, as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers. With the guidance of experienced branch managers (who have an average tenure of 12 years with us), branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers.
Branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide. We have also expanded our national sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities. Increasingly, branches call on our executives, our global sales staff, and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements.
Relationships with Transportation Providers We continually work on establishing relationships with good transportation providers to assure dependable services, favorable pricing, and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply. Because we do not own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers freight, these relationships are critical to our success. We rely on them to provide us with information regarding the status of shipments during transit and upon delivery.
7 As of December31, 2007, we had qualified approximately 48,000 transportation providers worldwide, of which the vast majority are motor carriers. To strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers, our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization, reducing their empty miles, and repositioning their equipment. To make it easier for carriers to work with us, we have a policy of prompt payment and offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount, along with offering in-trip advances through our T-Chek subsidiary.
These motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans, dry vans and flatbeds. These carriers are of all sizes, including owner-operators of a single truck, small and mid-size fleets, private fleets and the largest national trucking companies. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one carrier. Our largest truckload carrier was less than 1% of our total cost of transportation in 2007. Approximately 75% of our truckload shipments in 2007 were transported by motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors. We qualify each carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured, has the necessary federally issued authority to provide transportation services, and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis. Our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us, and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages. Our standard contracts do not include volume commitments, and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier.
We also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners, stacktrain operators, and all Class 1 railroads in North America, giving us access to additional trailers and containers. Our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail. Intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customer-specific basis.
In our non-asset based ocean transportation (NVOCC) and freight forwarding business, we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers. We negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay our ocean carriers. The rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers, specific trade lane requirements, and anticipated growth in the international shipping marketplace. These contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business, such as additional trade lanes.
In our international air freight forwarding business, we purchase transportation services from approximately 200 air carriers through charter services, block space agreements, and transactional spot market negotiations. Through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements. Our block space agreements are annual contracts that include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed annually or throughout the year. The transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment.
Competition The transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against a large number of other non-asset based logistics companies, asset-based logistics companies, third party freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, and freight forwarders. We also compete against carriers internal sales forces. We also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies that compete with us.
In our Sourcing business, we compete with produce brokers, produce growers, produce marketing companies, produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups. We also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us.
The primary business of our Information Services business, which is comprised of our subsidiary T-Chek Systems, is fuel card services.The fuel card processing industry is very consolidated and a small number of companies represent the majority of the market.
We often compete with respect to price, scope of services, or a combination thereof, but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are:  Our branch network, which enables our salespeople to gain broad knowledge about individual customers, carriers and the local and regional markets they serve, and to provide superior customer service based on that knowledge. This network also offers customers higher service as responsibility for shipments is commonly shared across branches, to provide nationwide coverage and local market knowledge;  Our 48,000 carrier relationships; 8  Our size, relative to other providers, is an advantage in attracting more carriers, which in turn enables us to serve our customers more efficiently and earn more business. Additionally, because of the large number of transactions we do annually, 6.5million in 2007, we have greater opportunity to efficiently identify available capacity for our customers needs;  Our non-asset based model, which enables us to remain flexible in our service offerings to our customers;  Our dedicated employees and entrepreneurial culture, which are supported by our performance-based compensation system;  Our proprietary information systems;  Our ability to provide a broad range of logistics services; and  Our ability to provide door-to-door services on a worldwide basis.
Communications and Information Systems Our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate, service our customers and carriers, and manage our business. Our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 6.5million shipments annually, 29,000 customer relationships, and 48,000 carrier relationships. Our employees are linked with each other and with our customers, carriers, and suppliers by telephone, fax, Internet, e-mail, and/or EDI to communicate shipment requirements and availability, and to confirm and bill orders. Through our Internet sites CHRWonline.com and CHRWtrucks.com, customers and carriers can contract for shipments or equipment as well as track and trace shipments, including delivery confirmation. Customers, carriers, and suppliers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the Internet.
Our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities, communicate and coordinate activity with other branches, and cross-cover or find equipment for other branches freight. Our systems help our salespeople service customer orders, select the optimal modes of transportation, build and consolidate shipments, and select routes, all based on customer-specific service parameters. Our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers, enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track shipments in progress. Our systems automatically provide alerts to arising problems. Our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers and carriers. These reports provide them with information on traffic patterns, product mix, and production schedules, and support analysis of their own customer base, transportation expenditure trends, and the impact on out-of-route costs.
Government Regulation We are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. Under certain limited circumstances, one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the DOT and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the DOT, including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a NVOCC for which we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. We operate as an indirect air carrier of cargo subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight, some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing, registration or permit requirements. We generally contractually require and/or rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements. We, along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers, are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations. Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability.
We source fresh produce under licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as required by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA). Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations. Our T-Chek operations are subject to federal and state regulations, including but not limited to the Bank Security Act of 1970.
9 Risk Management and Insurance We require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least $750,000 in auto and general liability insurance and $25,000 in cargo insurance. Many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements. Railroads, which are generally self-insured, provide limited common carrier liability protection, generally up to $250,000 per shipment.
We do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding, ocean transportation, and air freight businesses. We offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit. When we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms, we provide limited warehousemans coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage.
We maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier. We also carry various liability insurance policies, including auto and general liability, with a $100 million umbrella in 2007 and a $200 million umbrella in 2008. Our contingent auto liability coverage has a retention of $5 million per incident for the years 2004 through 2006 and a retention of $3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008.
Agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. Concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls, and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. As a seller of produce, we may, under certain circumstances, have legal responsibility arising from produce sales. We carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk. In addition, in the event of a recall, we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, as well as potential consequential damages, which are generally not insured. Any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation, particularly of our proprietary and licensed branded produce programs. Loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine part of the sourcing business.
Investor Information We were reincorporated in Delaware in 1997 as the successor to a business existing, in various legal forms, since 1905. Our corporate office is located at 14701 Charlson Road, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55347-5088, and our telephone number is (952)937-8500. Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through our website (www.chrobinson.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

These forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any statements regarding our current assumptions about future financial performance; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating activities for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the effects, benefits or other aspects of current or future acquisitions or dispositions; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; the results, timing, outcome or effect of litigation and our intentions or expectations of prevailing with respect thereto; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future of the third party logistics industry, all of which are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
When used in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, in oral statements made by or with the approval of any of our executive officers, the words or phrases believes, may, could, will, expects, should, continue, anticipates, intends, will likely result, estimates, projects or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. However, any statements contained in this Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.

You should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock. We intend to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA) by providing this discussion. We are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except to the extent required by law.
ITEM1A.
Risk Factors Demand for our services may decrease during an economic recession . The transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. If economic recession or a downturn in our customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, particularly among certain national retailers or in the food, beverage, retail, manufacturing, paper, or printing industries, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Higher carrier prices or fuel costs may result in decreased gross profit margin.
Carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses, and our gross profits and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher transportation costs.
We depend upon others to provide equipment and services.
We do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight. We are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck, rail, ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims. This reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing revenue and claims. If we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. Many of these risks are beyond our control including:  equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among truckload carriers,  interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation as a result of labor disputes,  changes in regulations impacting transportation, and  unanticipated changes in transportation rates.
Our international business raises additional difficulties.
We provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis. Our business outside of the United States is subject to various risks, including:  changes in economic and political conditions and in governmental policies,  changes in compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations,  wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts,  natural disasters,  changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements and taxations,  difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations,  limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls,  different liability standards, and  intellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including but not limited to our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region.
As we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have limited control over these risks, and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.
11 Our ability to hire and retain additional people is important to the continued growth of our business.
Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals. Our growth may be limited if we cannot recruit and retain a sufficient number of people. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Because of our comprehensive employee training program, our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors. Our rapid expansion of operations has placed added demands on our management. Continued expansion depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers.
We face substantial industry competition.
Competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad based. We compete against other non-asset based logistics companies as well as logistics companies that own their own equipment, third party freight brokers, Internet matching services and Internet freight brokers, and carriers offering logistics services. We also compete against carriers internal sales forces. We often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors. Increased competition could create downward pressure on freight rates, and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our gross profit and income from operations.
We are reliant on technology to operate our business.
We have internally developed the majority of our operating systems. Our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers. We are reliant on our technology staff to successfully implement changes to our operating systems in an efficient manner. Computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems. Unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages. An unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business.
Because we manage our business on a decentralized basis, our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices.
We manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout North America, South America, Europe and Asia, supported by executives and services in a central corporate office, with branch management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations, profitability, personnel decisions and the growth of the business in their branch. Our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations. In addition, certain of our branches operate with management, sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination. Our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation.
Our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry.
Results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season. In recent years, our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters. Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future.
We are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations.
We use the services of thousands of transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations. From time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the carrier. Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner operators or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, or may not be covered by insurance at all. In addition, our auto liability policy has a retention of $5 million per incident for years 2004 through 2006 and a retention of $3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008 .
A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims or workers compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability.
Our Sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce.
The supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions (such as drought, insects and disease), and other conditions over which we have no control. Commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile. If we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently.
Sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability.
Agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. Product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged 12 contamination, often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. Because we sell produce, we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages. While we are insured for up to $101 million in 2007 and $201 million in 2008 for product liability claims, settlement of class action claims is often costly, and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available. If we have to recall produce, we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing, transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, which our insurance does not cover. Any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation, particularly of our proprietary and/or licensed branded produce programs. Loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine part of the sourcing business.
Our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations.
We are licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle. We must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity. We are also licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission as an ocean freight forwarder, which requires us to maintain a non-vessel operating common carrier bond and by the Transportation Security Administration as an independent air carrier. We are also licensed by the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We source fresh produce under a license issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
Legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services. As part of our logistics services, we operate leased warehouse facilities. Our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services, and we are subject to various federal and state environmental, work safety and hazardous materials regulations. We may experience an increase in operating costs, such as costs for security, as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities. No assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges.
We cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business. Our failure to maintain required permits or licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses.
We derive a significant portion of our gross revenues and gross profit from our largest clients.
Our top 100 customers comprise approximately one-third of consolidated gross profits with none of them individually exceeding three percent. The sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
We may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments.
We may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. Even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we acquire a company, we may have difficulty integrating its businesses, products, services, technologies and personnel into our operations. Acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities, and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and workforce, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments. The issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders.
Our growth and profitability may not continue, which may result in a decrease in our stock price.
Historically, our long-term growth objective has been 15% for gross profits, operating income, and earnings per share. There can be no assurance that our long-term growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management, administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth. Our operating margins could be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic or political conditions. Slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price.

PROPERTIES We built a new 105,000 square foot corporate headquarters facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota which opened in October, 2007. We also lease approximately 67,000 square feet of additional office space in Eden Prairie, Minnesota for our information technology function.
13 All but one of our branch offices are leased from third parties under leases with initial terms ranging from three to ten years. However, we do own the 80,000 square foot location in Chicago listed below. Our office locations range in space from 1,000 to 153,000 square feet.

We have not had difficulty in obtaining sufficient office space and believe we can renew existing leases or relocate branches to new offices as leases expire.
ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As we previously disclosed, during 2002 we were named as a defendant in two lawsuits brought by a number of present and former employees. The first lawsuit alleged a hostile working environment, unequal pay, promotions, and opportunities for women, and failure to pay overtime (FLSA). The second lawsuit alleged a failure to pay overtime. The plaintiffs in both lawsuits sought unspecified monetary and non-monetary damages and class action certification.
On March 31, 2005, the judge issued an order denying class certification for the hostile working environment claims, and allowing class certification for certain claims of gender discrimination in pay and promotion. The judge also granted our motions for summary judgment as to the hostile working environment claims of ten of the named plaintiffs, and dismissed those claims. The gender discrimination class claims and the remaining two hostile work environment claims were settled on April 11, 2006, and subsequently approved by the Court on September 18, 2006. The settlement was within our insurance coverage limits, and was fully funded by the insurance carriers.
The settlement of the gender discrimination class claims did not include the overtime pay lawsuits, or the claims of putative class members who subsequently filed individual EEOC charges after the denial of class status on March 31, 2005. 54 of those EEOC claimants filed lawsuits. Forty-three of those suits have been settled or dismissed. The settlement amount was not material to our financial position or results of operations. We are vigorously defending the remaining 11 lawsuits.
14 Although the gender class settlement was fully funded by the insurance carriers, those carriers reserved the right to seek a court ruling that a portion of the settlement was not covered under their policies, and also to dispute payment of certain defense costs incurred in that litigation. Insurance coverage litigation between us and one of our insurance carriers concerning these issues and insurance coverage for the individual lawsuits has been pending in Minnesota State Court. Recent court rulings have determined that the gender class settlement payment was appropriately covered under applicable policies, and that the insurance carrier has a duty to reimburse reasonable defense costs in the gender class action and all but two of the individual lawsuits, and to indemnify C.H. Robinson in all but two of the individual lawsuits. This ruling is subject to appeal.
With respect to the FLSA overtime claims, the judge issued an order granting in full our Motion to Decertify the FLSA collective action on September 26, 2006. The judge retained jurisdiction over the named plaintiffs FLSA overtime claims and dismissed the claims of the opt-in plaintiffs, without prejudice to their right to bring their own claims in separate lawsuits in appropriate venues. Approximately 525 of the dismissed opt-in plaintiffs either filed or joined in lawsuits asserting individual FLSA claims for failure to pay overtime. Approximately 37 of those individuals have filed voluntary dismissals of their claims. We have reached an agreement to settle all of the remaining lawsuits. This agreement was approved by the Court on February 20, 2008. The settlement amount was not material to our financial position or results of operations.
We are not subject to any other pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

During 1999, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, allowing for the repurchase of 8,000,000 shares. We purchased approximately 3,221,300 shares of our Common Stock in 2007 under this program. There are no shares remaining for purchase under this program. During 2007, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase an additional 10,000,000 shares under the program. We purchased approximately 63,000 shares of our Common Stock in 2007 under this program. There are approximately 9,937,000 shares remaining for purchase under this program. We intend to fund any future repurchases with internally generated funds.
15 We declared quarterly dividends during 2006 for an aggregate of $.57 per share and quarterly dividends during 2007 for an aggregate of $.76 per share. We have declared a quarterly dividend of $.22 per share payable to shareholders of record as of March7, 2008, payable on April1, 2008. Our declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Any determination as to the payment of dividends will depend upon our results of operations, capital requirements and financial condition, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will declare or continue to pay dividends on the shares of Common Stock in the future.
Participants in the Robinson Companies Retirement Plan may, among other investment options, elect to invest their contributions and all company matching contributions in shares of our Common Stock. When plan participants elect to invest plan contributions in shares of our Common Stock, the plan trustee, Wachovia, purchases shares of our Common Stock on the open market and holds those shares beneficially for plan participants. During the quarter ended December31, 2007, plan participants elected to invest plan contributions in a total of approximately 27,542 shares of our Common Stock having an approximate aggregate purchase price of $1,491,000. Because participants may elect to invest plan contributions in shares of our Common Stock, the plan is required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933. There is no exemption from registration under the Securities Act available for the plan. On November12, 2003, we registered the plan pursuant to a Form S-8 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)).Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
(b) Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007.
During the third quarter, we acquired LXSI Services, Inc., which isnot included in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, managements conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting does not extend to this company.
