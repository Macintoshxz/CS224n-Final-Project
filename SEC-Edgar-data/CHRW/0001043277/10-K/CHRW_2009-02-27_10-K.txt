PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (the company, Robinson, we, us, or our) is one of the largest third party logistics companies in North America with 2003 gross revenues of $3.6 billion. We provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes, in a wide variety of industries. During 2003, we handled approximately 3.2 million shipments for more than 16,000 customers. We operate through a network of 158 offices, which we call branches, in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. We have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide. As a result, we have the capability of managing all aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers.
We are a non-asset based transportation provider, meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers freight. Through our relationships with approximately 30,000 transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight and ocean carriers, we select and hire the appropriate transportation to manage our customers freight needs. Being non-asset based means we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers, rather than on asset utilization. As an integral part of our transportation services, we provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as supply chain analysis, freight consolidation, core carrier program management, and information reporting.
In addition to multimodal transportation services, we have two other logistics business lines: fresh produce sourcing and fee-based information services.
Sourcing (the buying, selling, and brokering of fresh produce) was our original business when we were founded in 1905. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities. We purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers. Our customers include produce wholesalers, large grocery retailers, restaurants, and foodservice distributors. In the majority of cases, we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment. In response to demand and changing market conditions, we have developed our own brand of produce, The Fresh 1  , and have entered into licensing agreements for national brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our national brand programs.
Information Services, our third business line, is comprised of a C.H. Robinson subsidiary, T-Chek Systems, Inc. T-Cheks customers are motor carriers, for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as funds transfer, driver payroll services, fuel management services, and fuel and use tax reporting. For several companies and truck stop chains, T-Chek captures sales and fuel cost data, provides management information to the seller, transfers funds to the truck stop, and invoices the carrier for fuel, cash advances, and our fee.
Our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth. Our principal competitive advantage is our large decentralized branch network of 158 offices, staffed by approximately 3,000 salespeople. These branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and carriers, which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers and carriers changing needs. Branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and operations. A significant portion of our branch employees compensation is performance-oriented, based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch. We believe this makes our sales employees more service-oriented, focused, and creative.
We have grown over the years both internally by expanding or opening new branch offices and by selective acquisitions when circumstances warranted. In October 2003, we acquired the ongoing operations, assets and certain liabilities of Frank M. Viet GmbH Internationale Spedition (Viet). Viet is an international freight forwarding and third party logistics company based in Hamburg, Germany. Viet had annual gross revenues of approximately $5.6 million in 2002. In February 2004, we acquired Camway Transportation Corporation (Camway), a third party logistics company based in Toledo, Ohio, that provides domestic truckload and intermodal transportation brokerage services. Camway had annual gross revenues of approximately $17.0 million in 2003.
Multimodal Transportation Services C.H. Robinson is a third party logistics company. We provide freight transportation and logistics services. We are a non-asset based provider, meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight. We make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them, and what we pay to the transportation provider (also known as a carrier) to transport the freight.
1 We can arrange all of the following modes of transportation, on a worldwide basis:  Truck  Through our contracts with approximately 30,000 motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature-controlled units, and flatbeds. We also offer time-definite and expedited truck transportation. In many instances we will consolidate partial loads for several customers into full truckloads.
Less Than Truckload (LTL)  LTL transportation involves the shipment of small packages and single or multiple pallets of freight, up to and including full trailer-load freight. We focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor carriers and our operating system, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight.
Intermodal  C.H. Robinsons intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers, by a combination of truck and rail. We have intermodal marketing contracts with several railroads, and we arrange local pickup and delivery (known as drayage) through local motor carriers.
Ocean  As an indirect ocean carrier and freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments, and arrange for customs clearance of shipments, including the payment of duties.
Air  We provide door-to-door service as a full-service air freight forwarder, primarily internationally.
On a day-to-day basis, customers communicate their freight needs, typically on a load-by-load basis, to the branch office salesperson responsible for their account. They communicate with us by means of telephone, fax, Internet, e-mail, or EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). The branch employee enters all appropriate information about each load into our operating system. With the help of information provided by the operating system, the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the load and selects a carrier or carriers, based upon their knowledge of the carriers service capability, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. Based on the information he or she has about the market and rates, the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point, or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price. Once the carrier is selected, the salesperson communicates with the carriers dispatch office to agree on the price for the transportation and the carriers commitment to provide the transportation. At this point, the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer. Our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer.
We are a principal in the transaction. By accepting the customers order, we become responsible for transportation of the load from origin to destination. The carriers contract is with us, not the customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges. Also, we usually are responsible to our customer for any claims for damage to freight while in transit or performance. In most cases, we receive reimbursement from the carrier for these claims.
As a result of our logistics capabilities, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center. In a number of instances, we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle a specified number of loads usually to specified destinations, such as from the customers plant to a distribution center. Our commitment to handle the loads is usually at specific rates, but subject to seasonal variation. Most of our rate commitments are for one year or less. To meet our obligations under these customer contracts, we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport the contracted loads, for the length of our customer contract, but most of our truckload freight is priced to our carriers on a spot market, or transactional, basis.
In the course of providing day-to-day transportation services, our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain. We offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies. We will analyze the customers current transportation rate structures, modes of shipping, and carrier selection. We can evaluate a customers core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers. We can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings. We will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures, and manage claims. We can help customers minimize storage through cross-docking and other flow-through operations. We may also examine the customers warehousing and dock procedures. Many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately. They are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us, based on the nature of the customer relationship. In addition to these transportation services, we may supply sourcing, contract warehousing, consulting, and other services, for which we are usually paid separately.
2 As we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions, our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become business partners with our customers, responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management. We may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches. Our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network. See our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 and our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, in the United States and in foreign locations.
The table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated: Transportation Gross Profits (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 Truck(1) $ 401,709 $ 361,353 $ 347,991 $ 313,650 $ 202,877 Intermodal 28,103 21,111 16,119 14,422 10,738 Ocean 19,027 17,007 16,345 16,337 11,476 Air 4,891 3,068 2,699 3,555 2,858 Miscellaneous(2) 10,973 8,772 7,286 7,177 5,899 Total $ 464,703 $ 411,311 $ 390,440 $ 355,141 $ 233,848 (1) Includes LTL gross profits.
(2) Consists of customs clearance (Automated Brokerage Interface (ABI) and Automated Clearing House (ACH) capabilities with the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection), warehousing, fee-based transportation management services, and other miscellaneous services.
Transportation services accounted for approximately 85% of our gross profits in each of 2003, 2002, and 2001.
Sourcing Throughout our 99-year history, we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, produce must be quickly packaged, transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment, and distributed quickly to replenish high turnover inventories maintained by wholesalers, foodservice companies, restaurants, and retailers. In most instances, we consolidate individual customers produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads, often to multiple destinations.
During the past eight years, we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers. Traditionally, grocery retailers have relied mainly on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and store-level distribution. As these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation, these methods have become inefficient. Our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers produce purchasing, and provide uniform quality from region to region and store to store. Our sourcing services have expanded to include just-in-time replenishment, commodity management and business analysis. In response to demand and changing market conditions, we introduced our proprietary brand of produce, The Fresh 1  , which includes a wide range of fruits and vegetables that are uniform in quality and top grade. Since 1998, we have entered into new branded produce programs, including licensing agreements for major national brands. These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with some of our retail customers. We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our national brand programs.
Sourcing accounted for approximately 10% of our gross profits in each of 2003, 2002, and 2001.
3 Information Services Information Services is comprised of a subsidiary of C.H. Robinson, T-Chek Systems, Inc. T-Cheks customers are motor carriers and truck stop chains. T-Chek provides its motor carrier customers with funds transfer and driver payroll services, fuel management services, fuel and use tax reporting, and on-line access to custom-tailored information management reports, all through the use of its proprietary automated systems. These systems enable motor carriers to track equipment, manage fleets, and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel. For several companies and truck stop chains, T-Chek captures sales and fuel cost data, provides management information to the seller, and invoices the carrier for fuel, cash advances, and our fee.
Information Services accounted for approximately 5% of our gross profits in each of 2003, 2002, and 2001.
Organization To keep us close to our customers and markets, we have created and continue to expand a network of 158 offices, which we call branches. Our branches are supported by executives and other centralized, shared services. Approximately 14% of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized, shared services.
Branch Network Each branch office is responsible for its own growth and profitability. Our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business, negotiating and pricing services, receiving and processing service requests from customers, and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested. In addition to routine transportation, salespeople are often called upon to handle customers unusual, seasonal, and emergency needs. Shipments to be transported by truck are usually contracted and priced at the branch level, and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers to transport loads. Branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting LTL, intermodal, international and air shipments. Multiple branches may also work together to service larger, national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customers needs. Their efforts are usually coordinated by one lead branch on the account.
Salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers. Sales opportunities are identified through our database, referrals from current customers, leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets, and third party sources such as industry directories. Salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers, who are qualified by our carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured, and have the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis.
Branch Expansion.
We expect to continue to open new branch offices. New branch offices are viewed as a long-term contributor to overall company growth. In addition to market opportunity, a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch. Additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch, such as within major cities, as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch. A modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch, usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space, communications and hardware, and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time.
Branch Employees.
Because the quality of our employees is essential to our success, we are highly selective in our hiring. We recruit applicants from across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Our applicants typically have college degrees, and some have business experience, although not necessarily within the transportation industry.
Newly hired branch employees go through on-the-job training at the branch level, which ranges from six months to a year and emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team. We expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks. After approximately a year of experience, each salesperson attends our national training meeting to get additional training and have the opportunity to develop relationships with employees of other branches.
Employees at the branch level form a team. The team structure is motivated by our incentive compensation system, in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch or business unit. For any calendar year, branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branchs earnings for that calendar year, based on a system of points awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contributions. Employees can also receive profit sharing contributions 4 that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our Profit Sharing Plan. In some special circumstances, such as opening new branches, we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time.
All of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 Omnibus Stock Plan. To promote long-term share ownership, in 2003, 656 employees were awarded a total of 866,025 restricted stock units or shares. Employees at all levels, after a qualifying period of employment, are eligible to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals. They are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths, including branch management, national sales, and national account management. We have a promote from within philosophy, and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees.
Executive Officers Under our decentralized business structure, branch managers report directly to, and receive guidance and support from, a small group of executive officers at our central corporate office. Customers, carriers, managers, and employees have direct access to our chief executive officer, John Wiehoff, and all other executive officers. These executives provide training and education, develop new services and applications to be offered to customers, share operations and management guidance, and provide broad market analysis.
The executive officers serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are chosen annually by the Board of Directors.

Employees As of December 31, 2003, we had a total of 4,112 employees, of whom 3,551 were located in our branch offices. Corporate services such as accounting, information systems, legal, marketing communications, human resources, credit support, and claims support are provided centrally. We believe that our compensation and benefit plans are among the most competitive in the industry and that our relationship with our employees is good.
Customers and Marketing We seek to establish long-term relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services. During 2003, we served over 16,000 customers worldwide, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries. During 2003, no customer accounted for more than 8% of gross revenues or 5% of gross profits. In recent years, we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes and providing more services to our existing customers.
We believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions, as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers. With the guidance of experienced branch managers (who have an average tenure of 12 years with us), branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers.
Branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide. We have also expanded our national sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities. Increasingly, branches call on our executives, our national sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements.
Relationships with Carriers We continually work on establishing relationships with good carriers to assure dependable services, favorable pricing, and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply. To strengthen and maintain our relationships with carriers, our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization, reducing their empty miles, and repositioning their equipment. To make it easier for carriers to work with us, we have a policy of prompt payment.
As of December 31, 2003, we had contracts with approximately 30,000 motor carriers. These motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans, dry vans and flatbeds. These carriers are of all sizes, including owner-operators of a single truck, small and mid-size fleets, private fleets and the largest national trucking companies. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one carrier. Our largest truckload carrier was less than 1% of our total purchased truckload cost in 2003. We qualify each motor carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured, and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis. Our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us, and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages. To fulfill regulatory requirements, our motor carrier contracts commit to a series of three shipments and an initial transportation rate. Our contracts do not include volume commitments, and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual load with a carrier. As of December 31, 2003, we also had intermodal marketing contracts with several railroads, including all of the major North American railroads, giving us access to additional trailers and containers. Our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail. Intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customer-specific basis.
Competition The transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against a large number of other non-asset based logistics companies, asset-based logistics companies, third party freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, and freight forwarders. We also compete against carriers internal sales forces and shippers own transportation departments. We also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies with which we compete.
7 We often compete with respect to price, scope of services, or a combination thereof, but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are:  our large decentralized branch network, which enables our salespersons to gain broad knowledge about individual customers, carriers and the local and regional markets they serve, and to provide superior customer service based on that knowledge,  our proprietary information systems,  our ability to provide a broad range of logistics services, and  our ability to provide door-to-door services on a worldwide basis.
Communications and Information Systems Our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate, service our customers and carriers, and manage our business. Our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 3 million shipments annually and 30,000 carrier relationships. Our employees are linked with each other and with our customers and our carriers by telephone, fax, Internet, e-mail, and/or EDI to communicate load requirements and availability, and to confirm and bill orders. Through our Internet sites CHRWonline and CHRWtrucks.com, customers and carriers can contract loads or equipment and track and trace shipments. Customers and carriers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the Internet.
Our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities, communicate and coordinate activity with other branches, and cross-cover or find equipment for other branches freight. Our systems help our salespeople service customer orders, select the optimal modes of transportation, build and consolidate loads, and select routes, all based on customer-specific service parameters. Our systems also make load data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers, enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track loads in progress. Our systems automatically provide visible alerts to any arising problems. Our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers. These reports provide them with information on traffic patterns, product mix, and production schedules, and support analysis of their own customer base, transportation expenditure trends, and the impact on out-of-route costs.
Government Regulation The transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. For example, in 2004 the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued new Hours of Service regulations that affect many of our suppliers. We do not believe that these new regulations will have a material impact on our business and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry.
We are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. Under certain circumstances, one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the DOT and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the DOT, including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission as an ocean freight forwarder and we maintain a non-vessel operating common carrier bond. We operate as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the DOT and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the Bureau of U.S Customs and Border Protection.
We source fresh produce under a license issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations. Our T-Chek operations have recently become subject to federal and state money transfer regulations as a result of the law changes under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.
Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight, we continue to be subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements. We, along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers, are also subject 8 to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations. Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines or, in the event of serious violation, suspension or revocation of operating authority as well as increased claims liability.
Risk Management and Insurance We generally assume full value cargo risk for our customers in our truck and intermodal operations, unless stipulated contractually otherwise. We subrogate our losses against the motor or rail carrier with the transportation responsibilities. We require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least $750,000 in general liability insurance and $25,000 in cargo insurance. Many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums. Railroads, which are generally self-insured, provide limited common carrier liability protection, generally up to $250,000 per shipment.
We do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding, ocean transportation, and air freight businesses. We offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit. When we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms, we provide limited warehousemans coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage.
We maintain a broad cargo liability policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier. We also carry various liability policies, including auto and general liability, with a $100 million umbrella.
Agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. Concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls, and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. As a seller of produce, we may, under certain circumstances, have legal responsibility arising from produce sales. We carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk. In addition, in the event of a recall, we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, which is generally not insured. Any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation, particularly of our The Fresh 1  brand. Loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine part of the sourcing business.
Investor Information We were reincorporated in Delaware in 1997 as the successor to a business existing, in various legal forms, since 1905.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We lease approximately 67,000 square feet of office space in Eden Prairie, Minnesota as our corporate headquarters. Our corporate headquarters lease expires in 2014. We lease approximately 16,000 square feet of additional office space in Eden Prairie, Minnesota as the operating headquarters for our subsidiary, T-Chek Systems.
All of our 158 branch offices are leased from third parties under leases with initial terms ranging from three to ten years. Our branch offices range in space from 1,000 to 79,000 square feet. The following table lists our largest US branch offices: City/State ApproximateSquareFeet Chicago, IL 79,000 Eden Prairie, MN 40,000 Southfield, MI 15,206 Des Plaines, IL 14,725 Willowbrook, IL 11,352 Oak Brook, IL 10,749 Coralville, IA 10,071 College Park, GA 9,317 Tampa, FL 8,721 Paulsboro, NJ 7,979 Cordova, TN 7,276 Grand Rapids, MI 7,074 Brooklyn Center, MN 6,603 Knoxville, TN 6,577 Miami, FL 6,292 Montvale, NJ 6,207 Sugarland, TX 6,102 Duluth, GA 6,069 Independence, OH 6,043 Medley, FL 6,000 We also lease approximately 567,000 square feet of warehouse space throughout the United States. The following table lists our largest warehouses: City/State ApproximateSquareFeet Omaha, NE 157,000 Bollingbrook, IL 145,000 Rochester, NY 76,500 La Vergne, TN 62,000 Medley, FL 53,500 10 On January 29, 2004, we purchased an office building in Chicago, Illinois for $9.5 million. This building will have approximately 80,000 square feet of office space. This building will replace the leased space we currently occupy in Chicago, as disclosed in the table above. We consider our current office spaces and warehouse facilities adequate for our current level of operations. We have not had difficulty in obtaining sufficient office space and believe we can renew existing leases or relocate branches to new offices as leases expire.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As previously reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, we and others were named as defendants in three wrongful death lawsuits stemming from a multi-vehicle accident in 1999. All three of these lawsuits have been settled.
We settled the first of the three cases on January 3, 2003. Our insurance carriers had issued letters potentially denying coverage for some or all of the categories of possible damages. We believe our insurance carriers subsequently failed to discharge their good faith obligation to settle the lawsuit. We contributed $4.25 million as part of a complete settlement of our liability in the first lawsuit, while reserving our rights to proceed against our insurers. We filed a separate lawsuit against two of our insurance carriers, alleging wrongful conduct in the defense and settlement of the first case and demanding reimbursement of the $4.25 million contribution that we made. That case is still pending. Our insurance carriers settled the second and third lawsuits in February and March 2003 without contribution from us.
From time to time, we are involved in litigation arising out of our employment relationships. As first reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed on October 2, 2002, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota by a number of our present and former female employees. The lawsuit alleges a hostile working environment, unequal pay, promotions and opportunities for women and failure to pay overtime. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and non-monetary damages and class action certification. We deny all allegations and are vigorously defending the suit. In addition, we have insurance coverage for some of the claims asserted in the lawsuit. Currently, the amount of any possible loss to us cannot be estimated; however, an unfavorable result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Also as first reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, on November 7, 2002, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota by former employees of the company. The lawsuit alleges systematic failure by us to pay for overtime hours worked by our male employees under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The suit seeks payment of the overtime wages earned, as well as double damages and other relief, on behalf of the plaintiffs and potential collective members who join in the lawsuit. We deny all allegations and are vigorously defending the suit. Currently, the amount of any possible loss to us cannot be estimated; however, an unfavorable result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
We currently are not otherwise subject to any pending litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2003.
PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Our Common Stock began trading on The NASDAQ National Market under the symbol CHRW on October 15, 1997. Certain of our stockholders sold 24,330,310 shares of our Common Stock to the public pursuant to a registered public offering, the proceeds of which were paid entirely to the selling stockholders. Prior to such date, there was no established public trading market for our Common Stock. On October 24, 2000, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The new shares were distributed on December 1, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 10, 2000. All share and per share amounts in this Form 10-K have been restated to reflect our stock split.
11 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our Common Stock, as quoted on the NASDAQ National Market.
2003 Low High Fourth Quarter $ 36.72 $ 43.00 Third Quarter 34.51 41.00 Second Quarter 32.01 38.76 First Quarter 27.00 34.49 2002 Low High Fourth Quarter $ 25.84 $ 32.86 Third Quarter 25.83 33.63 Second Quarter 31.14 35.40 First Quarter 27.90 33.83 On March 5, 2004, the closing sales price per share of our Common Stock as quoted on the NASDAQ National Market was $ 39.99 per share. On March 5, 2004, there were approximately 350 holders of record and approximately 12,000 beneficial owners of our Common Stock.
In conjunction with our initial public offering, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan under which up to 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock may be repurchased from time to time through open market transactions, block purchases, tender offers, private transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or otherwise. We purchased approximately 282,100 shares of our Common Stock in 2003 under this plan. There are no shares remaining to be purchased under this plan. During 1999, the Board of Directors authorized a second stock repurchase plan, allowing for the repurchase of 4,000,000 shares. We purchased approximately 157,300 shares of our Common Stock in 2003 under this plan. We intend to fund any future repurchases with internally generated funds.
We declared quarterly dividends during 2002 for an aggregate of $0.26 per share, and quarterly dividends during 2003 for an aggregate of $0.36 per share. We have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share payable to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2004, payable on April 1, 2004. Our declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Any determination as to the payment of dividends will depend upon our results of operations, capital requirements and financial condition, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will declare or continue to pay dividends on the shares of Common Stock in the future.
Participants in the Robinson Companies Retirement Plan may, among other investment options, elect to invest their contributions and our matching contributions in shares of our Common Stock. When plan participants elect to invest plan contributions in shares of our Common Stock, the plan trustee, American Express, purchases shares of our Common Stock on the open market and holds those shares beneficially for plan participants. During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, plan participants elected to invest plan contributions in a total of approximately 8,340 shares of our Common Stock having an approximate aggregate purchase price of $345,487. Because participants may elect to invest plan contributions in shares of our Common Stock, the plan is required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933. There is no exemption from registration under the Securities Act available for the plan. On November 12, 2003, we registered the plan pursuant to a Form S-8 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
