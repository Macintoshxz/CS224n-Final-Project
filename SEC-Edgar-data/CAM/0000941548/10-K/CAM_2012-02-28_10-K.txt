During the third quarter of 2010, the Company restructured its business segments, moving its Process Systems division from the Drilling & Production Systems (DPS) segment to a newly formed business segment, Process & Compression Systems (PCS), in order to enhance the Companys processing solutions for customers involved in the exploration, production, storage and transmission of crude oil and natural gas.PCS also includes the businesses that were previously part of the Compression Systems segment. The Companys other business segment is Valves & Measurement (V&M).For additional business segment information for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which Notes are incorporated herein by reference in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Camerons origin dates back to the mid-1800s with the manufacture of steam engines that provided power for plants and textile or rolling mills. By 1900, with the discovery of oil and gas, Camerons predecessor businesses over time became more focused on serving those companies involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas.This focus grew with the acquisition of various businesses including Cameron Iron Works (blowout preventers, ball valves, control equipment and McEvoy-Willis wellhead equipment and choke valves), The Bessemer Gas Engine Company (gas engines and compressors); Ajax Iron Works (compressors); Superior (engines and compressors); Joy Petroleum Equipment Group (valves, couplings and wellheads); and Joy Industrial Compressor Group (compressors).
Cameron is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in its current form on November 10, 1994. The Company operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cooper Industries, Inc. until June 30, 1995, when it was spun-off as a separate stand-alone company.Since then, Cameron has continued its acquisition strategy, having made numerous acquisitions, including the 1996 acquisition of Ingram Cactus Company, the 1998 acquisition of Orbit Valve International, Inc., 2004s acquisition of Petreco International, Inc., the purchase of substantially all of the businesses within the Flow Control segment of Dresser, Inc. in 2005 and the acquisition of NATCO Group Inc. ( NATCO ) in 2009.Today, Cameron is a Fortune 500 company with annual revenues exceeding $6 billion and a workforce of approximately 19,500 employees in more than 300 locations spanning more than 100 countries worldwide.

The products within this segment include surface and subsea production systems, blowout preventers (BOPs), drilling and production control systems, block valves, gate valves, actuators, chokes, wellheads, drilling riser and aftermarket parts and services.The segments businesses also manufacture elastomers, which are used in pressure and flow control equipment and other petroleum industry applications, as well as in the petroleum, petrochemical, rubber molding and plastics industries.
The businesses within this segment primarily market their products directly to end-users through a worldwide network of sales and marketing employees, supported by agents in some international locations. Due to the technical nature of many of the products, the marketing effort is further supported by a staff of engineering employees.Customers include oil and gas majors, national oil companies, independent producers, engineering and construction companies, drilling contractors, rental companies and geothermal energy producers.
The businesses included in this segment are as follows: Drilling Systems Drilling Systems is one of the leading global suppliers of integrated drilling systems for land, platform and subsea applications. Drilling equipment designed and manufactured includes ram and annular BOPs, control systems, drilling riser, drilling valves, choke and kill manifolds, diverter systems and aftermarket parts and services. The products are marketed under the Cameron  , Guiberson  , H&H CUSTOM  , H&H, Melco  and Townsend  brand names.
Although Drilling Systems continues to be a primary supplier of BOPs and related equipment to the drilling industry, customer demand has changed during the last few years.Newbuild rig orders peaked during the 2006  2008 period and have been on the decline since.However, land drilling has been bolstered recently by increased investment in unconventional markets like the major shale areas in North America and higher activity levels in the Middle East, Caspian and Far East.In April 2010, the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon experienced an explosion and fire, resulting in bodily injuries and loss of life, loss of the rig, and an unprecedented discharge of hydrocarbons into the Gulf of Mexico.This tragic incident has caused drilling contractors and operators, both on land and in deepwater environments, to turn to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for service, equipment repair and related parts, in many cases to re-certify BOP stacks back to OEM specifications.By year-end 2010, Drilling Systems had recorded a record level of aftermarket bookings and was experiencing a high level of orders for new land BOPs to replace an aging fleet.
Drilling Systems had previously initiated an expansion of its global aftermarket capabilities, and with the renewed industry emphasis on safety and enhanced focus on use of OEMs, has allocated additional resources to meet increased customer demands at its global repair and service facilities.Aftermarket capacity was added to facilities in Houston, Odessa and Brookshire (all in Texas) and Berwick, LA, and a new facility was added in Oklahoma.Additional aftermarket capacity expansions are currently under way in Aberdeen, Scotland; Beziers, France; the Middle East and Malaysia.

7 Market Issues Cameron is one of the leaders in the global market for the supply of petroleum production equipment. Cameron believes that it is well-positioned to serve these markets. Plant and service center facilities around the world in major oil- and gas-producing regions provide a broad market coverage. Information relating to revenues generated from shipments to various geographic regions of the world is set forth on page 29 of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The market beyond North America continues to be of greater importance to Cameron, accounting for approximately 60% or moreof Camerons revenues for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. The desire to expand oil and gas resources and transmission capacity in developed and developing countries, for both economic and political reasons, continues to be a major factor affecting market demand. Additionally, establishment of industrial infrastructure in the developing countries will necessitate the growth of basic industries that require plant air and process compression equipment. Production and service facilities in North and South America, Europe, the Far and Middle East and West Africa provide the Company with the ability to serve the global marketplace.
Based upon the Companys broad portfolio of products, the Company has a significant presence in the offshore oil and gas drilling, production and infrastructure market.Cameron provides BOPs, drilling and production risers, subsea production systems, oil and gas separation equipment, chokes, valves and compression equipment to the offshore market.In fact, six of the Companys eleven divisions participate in this market.Approximately 41% of the Companys 2010 revenues was derived from the deepwater market.
Cameron is also a significant participant in serving the subsea systems projects market.This market is significantly different from the Companys other markets since subsea systems projects are significantly larger in scope and complexity, in terms of both technical and logistical requirements. Subsea projects (i) typically involve long lead times, (ii) typically are larger in financial scope, (iii) typically require substantial engineering resources to meet the technical requirements of the project and (iv) often involve the application of existing technology to new environments and in some cases, new technology. The Companys subsea business unit received orders in the amount of $1.1 billion during 2010.Total backlog for the subsea business unit at December 31, 2010 was approximately $2.2 billion.To the extent the Company experiences unplanned efficiencies or difficulties in meeting the technical and/or delivery requirements of the projects, the Companys earnings or liquidity could be positively or negatively impacted.As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a subsea systems project backlog of approximately $1.5 billion.For additional information, see the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Also, see Part I, Item 1A for a discussion of other risk factors, some of which are market related, that could affect the Companys financial condition and future results.
New Product Development For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company incurred research and product development costs, including costs incurred on projects designed to enhance or add to its existing product offerings, totaling approximately $55.2 million, $43.3 million and $42.6 million, respectively.DPS accounted for 59%, 46% and 49% of each respective years total costs.
During 2010, Cameron received an order from an oil and gas operator for the design, test and manufacture of the worlds first 13 25,000-psi BOP stack for use in a high-pressure application in the Gulf of Mexico.
Additionally, after introducing the worlds first 18 20,000-psi BOP stack in 2009, Cameron received the first order for such a unit from a major offshore drilling contractor during 2010.This new offering provides the characteristics of reduced height and weight found in the EVO BOP that was introduced in 2007 as a compact, lighter version of Camerons traditional subsea BOP.Also during 2008, the Company introduced the Sea Pressure Accumulator (SPA), a complement to the EVO BOP, which uses seawater pressure instead of traditional nitrogen-charged accumulator bottles to power the BOP rams.
The Drilling Systems division also introduced Camerons RoboSpider in 2009, the worlds first fully automated hydraulic drilling riser torque system, and the NASMUX System, an acoustic controls system for subsea BOPs that offers an alternative to traditional multiplexed control systems.
8 During 2009, Camerons Surface Systems division began offering the EXACT-10 (10,000-psi) and EXACT-15 (15,000-psi) Adjustable Wellhead Systems, suitable for both exploration and production drilling applications, and a new DF-PA (Diver-Friendly Plug & Abandonment) System, designed specifically for installation on hurricane-damaged wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
Camerons Subsea Systems division made the initial deployment of its all-electric subsea production system, CameronDC, in late 2008 in Totals K5F field in the Dutch North Sea.This system has operated for more than two years on two producing gas wells.The performance to date has confirmed the viability of the technology.A second generation version of CameronDC is expected to launch during 2011, based on the experience derived from the initial two years of operations.In addition, the CameronDC process has yielded a spin-off product development, the Omni-Choke, introduced during 2010.The Omni-Choke provides the benefits and functionality of electric actuation as employed in CameronDC, but can be used in both new and existing applications with virtually any traditional controls system. Another recent offering from the Subsea Systems division is the Multiple Application Reinjection System (MARS), a unique well intervention system that serves as an interface between subsea production trees and a variety of processing equipment.The flexibility of the MARS system to address production and well intervention needs on both new and existing fields provides increased operational efficiency to the operator.This is accomplished by providing a more economical alternative to drill rig intervention for things such as chemical injection, fluid sampling, and other technologies that maintain and increase production through the life of a reservoir.The technology continues to be adopted by clients worldwide with over 80 units sold for a variety of applications.
Product innovations during 2010 by Camerons Flow Control division included the development of the first 25,000-psi-rated surface production choke and a large-bore (8-inch) subsea insert retrievable choke.Both products complement production tree solutions for key Cameron projects.
With the November 2009 acquisition of NATCO , Camerons Process Systems division added NATCOs unique CO 2 membrane separation technology to its current product offerings and has continued to make significant investments during 2010 to increase the efficiency and reduce the size of these applications for the offshore market.

Camerons test capabilities are critical to its overall processes. The Company has the capability to test most equipment at rated operating conditions, measuring all operating parameters, efficiency and emissions. All process compressors for air separation and all plant air compressors are given a mechanical and aerodynamic test in a dedicated test center prior to shipment.
All of Camerons Asian, European and Latin American manufacturing plants are ISO certified and API licensed, and most of the U.S. plants are ISO certified. ISO is an internationally recognized verification system for quality management.
Major Customers Largely as a result of major subsea project activity levels, revenue from BP p.l.c. and its consolidated subsidiaries accounted for approximately 12% of the Companys consolidated 2010 revenues.During 2009 and 2008, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues.
Backlog Camerons backlog was approximately $4.8 billion at December 31, 2010 (approximately 78% of which is expected to be shipped during 2011), as compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2009, and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2008.Backlog consists of customer orders for which a purchase order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property As part of its ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, Cameron has a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions involving new products and product improvements. Cameron owns 359 unexpired United States patents and 778 unexpired foreign patents. During 2010, 54 new U.S. and 52 new foreign patent applications were filed.
Although in the aggregate these patents are of considerable importance to the manufacturing of many of its products, Cameron does not consider any single patent or group of patents to be material to its business as a whole.
Trademarks are also of considerable importance to the marketing of Camerons products. Cameron considers the following trade names to be material to its business as a whole: CAMERON, COOPER-BESSEMER, AJAX, WILLIS, W-K-M and NATCO. Other important trademarks used by Cameron are included under Markets and Products above.Cameron has registered trademarks in countries where such registration is deemed important.
Cameron has the right to use the trademark Joy on aftermarket parts until November 2027.
Cameron also relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. Cameron routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, partners and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to Camerons trade secrets.
Employees As of December 31, 2010, Cameron had approximately 19,500 employees, of which approximately 23% were represented by labor unions. Over 892 of these employees are covered by contracts expiring in 2011. In Romania, the Company has approximately 546 employees at its facilities with contracts expiring on various dates in the second half of 2011.
The Company entered into a number of new agreements during 2010, one of which covers 383 employees in Leeds, United Kingdom.No other significant agreements were entered into during 2010.

12 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Company currently operates facilities ranging in size from approximately 600 square feet to approximately 1,243,000 square feet.In addition to its manufacturing facilities, the Company also owns and leases warehouses, distribution centers, aftermarket and storage facilities, sales and administrative offices. The Company leases its corporate headquarters office space and space for the DPS, V&M and PCS division headquarters in Houston, Texas.
The Company manufactures, markets and sells its products and provides services throughout the world, operating facilities in numerous countries. At December 31, 2010, the significant facilities used by Cameron throughout the world for manufacturing, distribution, aftermarket services, machining, storage, warehousing, sales and administration contained an aggregate of approximately 14,442,000 square feet of space, of which approximately 8,371,000 square feet (58%) was owned and approximately 6,071,000 (42%) was leased.Of this total, approximately 7,832,000 square feet of space (54%) is located in the Western Hemisphere, approximately 4,084,000 square feet of space (28%) is located in the Eastern Hemisphere, approximately 1,909,000 square feet of space (13%) is located in Asia Pacific and the Middle East and approximately 617,000 square feet of space (4%) is located in West Africa.

Cameron believes its facilities are suitable for their present and intended purposes and are adequate for the Companys current and anticipated level of operations.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to a number of contingencies, including litigation, tax contingencies and environmental matters.
Deepwater Horizon Matter A blowout preventer (BOP) originally manufactured by the Company and delivered in 2001, and to which the Company was one of the suppliers of spare parts and repair services, was deployed by the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon when it experienced a tragic explosion and fire on April 20, 2010, resulting in bodily injuries and loss of life, loss of the rig, and an unprecedented discharge of hydrocarbons into the Gulf of Mexico.
While the Company did not operate the BOP, nor did it have anyone on the rig at the time of the incident, claims for personal injury, wrongful death and property damage arising from the Deepwater Horizon incident have been and will continue to be asserted against the Company and others.Additionally, claims for pollution and other economic damages, including business interruption and loss of revenue, have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, asserted against all parties allegedly associated with this incident, including the Company, BP plc and certain of its subsidiaries, as the operating workinginterest owner of Mississippi Canyon Block 252 upon which the Macondo well was being drilled, Transocean Ltd. and certain of its affiliates, as the drillingrig owner and operator, as well as other equipment and service companies, including Halliburton.  The Company has been named as one ofmultiple defendants inover 330 suits filed in a variety of Federal and State courts, a number of which have been filed as class actions or multi-plaintiff actions.Most of thesesuits have been centralized into a single proceeding before a single Federal judge under the Federal rules governing multi-district litigation. The consolidated case is styled In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010 , MDL Docket No. 2179.There are alsoa small number ofcases pending in which Cameron is a party in state courts.The State of Alabama has brought a claim for destruction of and/or harm to natural resources against those associated with this incident, including Cameron, in State of Alabama, ex. rel. Troy King, Attorney General vs. Transocean Ltd., et. al., Cause No. 2:10cv00691, U.S. Dist. Ct., M.D. Ala.
, as have 4 municipalities and 3 Mexican states.All of these suits by governmental entities have been made part of the MDL proceeding. It is possible other such claims may be asserted by the United States Government and by the Gulf and/or East Coast States, whose Attorneys General have notified the Company to preserve documents in the event of a claim, and possibly by other parties.A shareholder derivative suit has been filed against the Companys directors in connection with this incident and its aftermath alleging the Companys directors failed to exercise their fiduciary duties regarding oversight of the Companys BOP business ( Berzner vs. Erikson, et al., Cause No. 2010-71817 in the 190th District Court of Harris County, Texas) . This incident and its causes are also being investigated by a joint investigation team of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the JIT), which has named Cameron as a party-in-interest, the Departments of the Interior and Justice, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, and by numerous other governmental entities, including Congressional Committees.
13 Based on the facts known to date, the Company is of the opinion that there was no defect in or failure of the BOP that caused or contributed to the explosion.The reasons as to why the efforts to shut-in the well after the explosionwere unsuccessful are not yet known and are the subject of multiple investigations.The results of a forensic examination of the BOP commissioned by the JIT as part of its investigation are expected to be made known by the end of March 2011.Additionally, the extent of the environmental impact, and the ultimate costs and damages that will ultimately be determined attributable to this incident and its aftermath are not yet known and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated. As a result, we are unable to make any reasonable determination of what liability, if any, the Company could be found to have with respect to any of these claims or whether the Company will be found to have any liability, directly or by way of contribution, under any environmental laws or regulations or otherwise. BP and Transocean, as well as Anadarko and Moex, as non-operating working interest owners, have been designated Responsible Parties liable for the pollution emanating from the Macondo well under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), and have, at least in part, accepted such designation. Cameron has not been named a Responsible Party under OPA.
The applicable contracts between Cameron and Transocean entities provide for customary industry knock-for-knock indemnification by which each party agreed to bear the risk of, and hold the other harmless with respect to, all claims for personal injury, to include wrongful death, and property loss or damage of its own, its employees and those of its invitees. In addition, the contracts provide that Transocean will indemnify Cameron for pollution or other damages associated with blowout or loss of well control to the fullest extent of any indemnity it has from its customers, which in this case is BP. Transocean has publicly stated that it has a full pollution indemnity from BP, though BP has so far declined to acknowledge any obligation under such indemnity. Whereas, Transocean has settled lawsuits filed by its employees and the settlement agreements provide for a release of Cameron, Transocean has yet to honor its indemnity obligations with respect to personal injury and property damage of its invitees or with respect to pollution liability.
The Company has commercial general liability insurance, including completed products and sudden accidental pollution coverage, with limits of $500 million and a self retention of $3 million. Defense costs are not covered by the policy. The Company has notified its insurers of the claims being asserted against it. Coverage includes claims for personal injury and wrongful death, as well as liability for pollution and loss of revenue/business interruption.
While the Companys BOPs have a history of reliable performance when properly maintained and operated in accordance with product specifications, until the litigation referred to aboveprogresses and until the investigations referred to above are completed, we are unable to determine the extent of the Companys future involvement in the litigation and any liability resulting from this incident.If it is ultimately determined that the Company bears some responsibility, and therefore liability, for the costs and damages caused by this event, we will rely on our contractual indemnity rights and then, if and to the extent necessary and available, on our insurance coverage. We have received a reservation of rights letter from our insurers.If our contractual indemnities are determined to be inapplicable, or the indemnitors fail or are unable to fulfill their contractual indemnity obligations, and if the damages and costs ultimately determined to be the Companys responsibility exceed our available insurance coverage, we could be liable for amounts that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Through December 31, 2010, the Company incurred and expensed legal fees of $12.5 million.The Company has not accrued any amounts relating to this matter because we do not believe at the present time a loss is probab le.
Other Litigation In 2001, the Company discovered that contaminated underground water from a former manufacturing site in Houston (see discussion below under Environmental Matters) had migrated under an adjacent residential area. Pursuant to applicable state regulations, the Company notified the affected homeowners. Concerns over the impact on property values of the underground water contamination and its public disclosure led to a number of claims by homeowners.The Company has settled these claims, primarily as a result of the settlement of a class action lawsuit, and is obligated to reimburse 197 homeowners for any diminution in value of their property due to contamination concerns at the time of any sale.
Based upon 2009 testing results of monitoring wells on the southeastern border of the plume, the Company notified at that time 33 homeowners whose property is adjacent to the class area that their property may be affected.The Company is taking remedial measures to prevent these properties from being affected.
The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that any potential exposure from existing agreements as well as any possible new claims that may be filed with respect to this underground water contamination will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Companys consolidated balance sheet included a liability of approximately $11.7 million for these matters as of December 31, 2010.
14 The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of multi-defendant, multi-plaintiff tort lawsuits since 1995. At December 31, 2010, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a liability of approximately $7.4 million for such cases. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that the potential exposure from these suits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Regulatory Contingencies The Company has completed its Focused Assessment Audit initiated in 2007 by the Regulatory Audit Division of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security.The audit report found that the Companys corrective actions taken in response to the audit findings were acceptable.
In July 2007, the Company was one of a number of companies to receive a letter from the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information on activities undertaken on their behalf by a customs clearance broker. The DOJ is inquiring into whether certain of the services provided to the Company by the customs clearance broker may have involved violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).In response, the Company engaged special counsel reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to conduct an investigation into its dealings with the customs clearance broker in Nigeria to determine if any payment made by the customs clearance broker in connection with the importation of Company property constituted a violation of the FCPA. Special counsel also reviewed the extent, if any, of the Companys knowledge and involvement in the performance of these services and activities and whether the Company fulfilled its obligations under the FCPA.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also conducting an informal inquiry into the same matters.The investigation by special counsel has been completed and the Company is waiting for the agencies to commence discussions regarding the ultimate disposition of this matter.At this stage, the Company cannot predict what the disposition of this matter will entail.
Tax Contingencies The Company has legal entities in over 35 countries. As a result, the Company is subject to various tax filing requirements in these countries. The Company prepares its tax filings in a manner which it believes is consistent with such filing requirements. However, some of the tax laws and regulations to which the Company is subject require interpretation and/or judgment. Although the Company believes the tax liabilities for periods ending on or before the balance sheet date have been adequately provided for in the financial statements, to the extent a taxing authority believes the Company has not prepared its tax filings in accordance with the authoritys interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, the Company could be exposed to additional taxes.
Environmental Matters The Company is currently identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to two sites designated for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state laws. One of these sites is Osborne, Pennsylvania (a landfill into which a predecessor of the PCS operation in Grove City, Pennsylvania deposited waste), where remediation is complete and remaining costs relate to ongoing ground water treatment and monitoring. The other is believed to be a de minimis exposure. The Company is also engaged in site cleanup under the Voluntary Cleanup Plan of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality at former manufacturing locations in Houston and Missouri City, Texas. Additionally, the Company has discontinued operations at a number of other sites which had been active for many years. The Company does not believe, based upon information currently available, that there are any material environmental liabilities existing at these locations. At December 31, 2010, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $6.8 million for environmental matters.
