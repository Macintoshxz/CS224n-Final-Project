BUSINESS Cameron International Corporation (Cameron or the Company) provides flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil, gas and process industries through three business segments, Drilling and Production Systems (DPS), Valves & Measurement (V&M) and Process & Compression Systems (PCS).For additional business segment information for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which Notes are incorporated herein by reference in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In 1920, Jim Abercrombie, Ed Lorehn, Harry Cameron and several other partners incorporated an oilfield repair shop in Houston, Texas under the name Cameron Iron Works (CIW). Abercrombie subsequently invented and CIW manufactured the industrys first blowout preventer for use in oil and gas well drilling. CIW grew rapidly due to sales of blowout preventers and other oilfield equipment. In the early 1940s, CIW entered the market for defense-related equipment becoming a major supplier of anti-submarine and other naval armaments to the U.S. Navy. CIW also became a leading supplier of forged metal products for both defense and oilfield applications replacing less durable cast metal components of the day. CIW subsequently expanded into various other flow control, valve and pressure control equipment businesses acquiring Joy Petroleum Equipment and McEvoy-Willis wellhead equipment prior to its acquisition by Cooper Industries, Inc. in 1989.
Cameron was incorporated in its current form as a Delaware corporation on November 10, 1994, when Cooper Industries transferred all of the assets and liabilities of its Petroleum and Industrial Equipment segment into this new entity. Following this, the Company operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cooper Industries from 1994 until June 30, 1995, when it was spun-off as a separate stand-alone company and renamed Cooper Cameron Corporation. The Company subsequently changed its name to Cameron International Corporation in May 2006. Since becoming a stand-alone company, Cameron has made numerous acquisitions, including the 1996 acquisition of Ingram Cactus Company, the 1998 acquisition of Orbit Valve International, Inc., 2004s acquisition of Petreco International, Inc., the purchase of substantially all of the businesses within the Flow Control segment of Dresser, Inc. in 2005, the acquisition of NATCO Group Inc. ( NATCO ) in 2009, the purchase of LeTourneau Technologies Drilling Systems, Inc. in 2011 and the acquisition of the TTS Energy Division from TTS Group, ASA in 2012. In 2013, Cameron and Schlumberger Limited joined together to form OneSubsea  , a venture established to manufacture and develop products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. Cameron is a 60% owner and manager of OneSubsea. Today, Cameron is a Fortune 500 company with annual revenues of $9.8 billion and a workforce of over 29,000 employees.

3 Table of Contents Business Segments Markets and Products Drilling & Production Systems Segment The DPS segment includes businesses that provide systems and equipment used to drill, control pressures and direct flows of oil and gas wells. Its products are employed in a wide variety of operating environments including basic onshore fields, highly complex onshore and offshore environments, deepwater subsea applications and ultra-high temperature geothermal operations.
The products within this segment include drilling equipment packages, blowout preventers (BOPs), drilling risers, top drives, draw works, complete wellhead and Christmas tree systems for onshore and offshore applications, subsea production systems and manifolds and aftermarket parts and services. In addition, the DPS segment designs and manufactures structural components for land and offshore drilling rigs. The segments businesses also manufacture elastomers, which are used in pressure and flow control equipment and other petroleum industry applications, as well as in the petroleum, petrochemical, rubber molding and plastics industries.
The businesses within this segment primarily market their products directly to end-users through a worldwide network of sales and marketing employees, supported by agents in some international locations. Due to the technical nature of many of the products, the marketing effort is further supported by a staff of engineering employees. Customers include oil and gas majors, national oil companies, independent producers, engineering and construction companies, drilling contractors, rental companies and geothermal energy producers.
The businesses included in this segment are as follows: Drilling Systems Drilling Systems is one of the leading global suppliers of integrated drilling systems for onshore and offshore applications. Drilling equipment designed and manufactured includes ram and annular BOPs, control systems, drilling risers, drilling valves, choke and kill manifolds, diverter systems, top drives, draw works, mud pumps, pipe handling equipment, other rig products and aftermarket parts and services. The products are marketed under the Cameron  , Guiberson  , H&H CUSTOM  , H&H Melco  , LeTourneau  , Lewco  , OEM  , Sense  and Townsend  brand names.
Drilling Systems significantly enhanced its product offerings to its customers with the late 2011 acquisition of LeTourneau Technologies Drilling Systems, Inc. (LeTourneau) from Joy Global Inc., and the mid-2012 acquisition of TTS Energy Division from TTS Group ASA, a Norwegian company (TTS). LeTourneau provides drilling equipment and rig designs and components for both the land and offshore rig markets. LeTourneaus products include elevating systems, skidding systems, cranes, top drives, rotary tables, draw works, mud pumps and rig control and power systems. TTS provides high performance drilling equipment, rig packages and rig solutions for both onshore and offshore rigs internationally.
Drilling Systems continues to be a primary supplier of BOPs and related equipment to the drilling industry. The level of major project awards for new drilling equipment is often influenced by construction cycles for new build deepwater drillships and semi-submersibles, as well as shallow water jack-up rigs. In recent years, the level of such awards was strong during the 2006  2008 and 2011  2012 time periods but has tapered off in 2013. During 2012, orders for drilling equipment nearly doubled from 2011 as a result of the LeTourneau and TTS acquisitions mentioned above and due to a high level of major awards for drilling stacks and related equipment for new deepwater drilling rigs and as spares for existing rigs. Additionally, land drilling has been bolstered in recent years by increased investment in unconventional markets like the major shale areas in North America and higher activity levels in the Middle East, Caspian and Far East.
Tighter regulations for the industry and an increased focus on safety have caused drilling contractors and operators, both on land and in deepwater environments, to turn to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for service, equipment repair and related parts, in many cases to re-certify BOP stacks back to OEM specifications or for new equipment to replace an aging fleet. This has led to increased demand for aftermarket services and for additional drilling stacks, BOPs and related equipment for use as spares to supplement or replace existing equipment currently in use. The strong level of demand for aftermarket parts and services has contributed to a record backlog in this business, including a 13% increase from year end 2012 levels.
4 Table of Contents Drilling Systems has had efforts underway in the last couple of years to expand its global aftermarket capabilities as a result of the renewed industry emphasis on safety and enhanced focus on use of OEMs. In order to meet increased customer demand, Drilling Systems increased its capital spending in 2013 by nearly 15% as compared to 2012 in order to expand its manufacturing capabilities in Singapore and Berwick, Louisiana, and to continue to add to its aftermarket capabilities worldwide.
Surface Systems Surface Systems designs and manufactures complete wellhead and Christmas tree systems for onshore and offshore applications  from conventional to high-pressure, high temperature systems, to specialized systems for dry completions and heavy oil.

Market Issues Cameron is one of the leaders in the global market for the supply of petroleum production equipment. Cameron believes that it is well-positioned to serve these markets. Plant and service center facilities around the world in major oil and gas producing regions provide broad market coverage. Information relating to revenues generated from shipments to various geographic regions of the world is set forth on page 29 of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The success of hydraulic fracturing activities in recent periods has led to increased supplies of natural gas in North America which has driven down prices. As a result, operations have begun to shift more to liquid plays such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford shale regions. The increased supplies of fossil fuels in North America resulting from these new exploration and production technologies, as well as a curtailment in demand as a result of economic conditions and energy saving and alternative energy initiatives, have led some organizations to forecast that North America could eventually become a net exporter of oil and natural gas. The success of these activities has also led to a heightened focus by government regulators which could impede the use of these new technologies or increase their cost in the future.
As a result of tighter regulations for the industry and an increased focus on safety, the Company has experienced increased demand, as described above, in its drilling aftermarket business to service and, in many cases, re-certify existing BOP stacks back to original OEM specifications. The Company believes this trend by operators to use OEMs to service their equipment will continue in the near future.
The market beyond North America continues to be of greater importance to Cameron, accounting for approximately 61% of Camerons revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, up from 55% in 2012. The desire to expand oil and gas resources and transmission capacity in developed and developing countries, for both economic and political reasons, continues to be a major factor affecting market demand. Production and service facilities in North and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and West Africa provide the Company with the ability to serve the global marketplace.
Based upon the Companys broad portfolio of products, Cameron has a significant presence in the offshore oil and gas drilling, production and infrastructure market. The Company provides BOPs, drilling and production risers, subsea production systems, oil and gas separation equipment, chokes, valves and compression equipment to the offshore market. In fact, six of the Companys divisions participate in this market. Approximately 44% of the Companys 2013 revenue was derived from the deepwater market.
Cameron is also a significant participant, through its OneSubsea venture with Schlumberger, in serving the subsea systems projects market.This market is significantly different from the Companys other markets since subsea systems projects are significantly larger in scope and complexity, in terms of both technical and logistical requirements. Subsea projects (i) typically involve long lead times, (ii) typically are larger in financial scope, (iii) typically require substantial engineering resources to meet the technical requirements of the project and (iv) often involve the application of existing technology to new environments and in some cases, new technology. The Companys OneSubsea business received orders of nearly $3.7 billion during 2013.Total backlog for OneSubsea at December 31, 2013 was almost $4.4 billion, of which approximately $3.0 billion was for subsea systems projects.To the extent the Company experiences unplanned difficulties in meeting the technical and/or delivery requirements of the projects or has difficulty fully integrating the businesses contributed by Schlumberger to OneSubsea into its operations, the Companys earnings or liquidity could be negatively impacted. For additional information, see the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Cameron International Corporation incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
8 Table of Contents The creation of OneSubsea in 2013 allows the Company to bring together Schlumbergers expertise in subsea processing and platform integration with Camerons capabilities in subsea equipment to provide customers with the ability to greatly increase their subsea reservoir recovery rates.
Also, see Part I, Item 1A for a discussion of other risk factors, some of which are market related, that could affect the Companys financial condition and future results.
New Product Development For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company incurred research and product development costs, including costs incurred on projects designed to enhance or add to its existing product offerings, totaling approximately $83.1 million, $62.7 million and $60.6 million, respectively. DPS accounted for 73%, 67% and 59% of each respective years total costs.
During 2012, Cameron funded university research along with research at a private spin-off business named NanoMech resulting in the creation of TriboTuff  lubricant, a macro-molecular nano-manufactured solution which reduces mechanical friction to near zero improving the performance of machinery and critical oilfield components.
Cameron is also funding university research in both the United States and Brazil in developing advanced materials that dampen vibration that could be caused by ocean currents in subsea environments. Cameron's researchers are working with a variety of technical partners around the world in developing elastomer seals that perform better in low temperature, high pressure environments.
During 2010, Cameron received an order from an oil and gas operator for the design, test and manufacture of the worlds first 13 25,000-psi BOP stack for use in a high-pressure application in the Gulf of Mexico. This new BOP was delivered to the customer in late 2011.
Additionally, after introducing the worlds first 18 20,000-psi BOP stack in 2009, Cameron received the first order for such a unit from a major offshore drilling contractor during 2010. This new offering provides the characteristics of reduced height and weight found in the EVO  BOP that was introduced in 2007 as a compact, lighter version of Camerons traditional subsea BOP. Also during 2008, the Company introduced the Sea Pressure Accumulator  (SPA), a complement to the EVO BOP, which uses seawater pressure instead of traditional nitrogen-charged accumulator bottles to power the BOP rams. In 2012, Cameron developed a derivative system of SPA called Sea Pressure Reduction Assembly (SPRA), which reduces hydrostatic seawater effects on the EVO BOP operating system. This, in turn, makes more efficient use of existing accumulator capacity.
In 2012, Cameron Drilling Systems, along with Valves & Measurements Caldon business, cooperatively worked to complete the full qualification of an ultrasonic position sensor to precisely measure BOP piston position.
Camerons Drilling Systems business also continues to focus on developing new technology for blowout preventers involving additional cavities and more shearing power for greater system redundancy.
Camerons Surface Systems division has in its rental fleet its FT-90 frac tree, an ultra-compact design that reduces the overall frac stack height, which improves efficiency and safety. It has also developed a Mono Line Frac Fluid Delivery System which eliminates a significant number of frac iron connections resulting in a reduced footprint and other safety benefits. In addition, Cameron is developing a line of tree mounted ball catchers targeted at the North and South America unconventional resource markets.
During 2011 and 2012, Surface Systems also manufactured the first 25,000 psi, 450F rated production tree, which has now been installed. The tree and wellhead system are suitable for a range of extreme production applications. The first full bore (18-3/4) 15,000 psi double metal seal wellhead was installed on an offshore platform in the North Sea. In 2012, Cameron also began delivering high spec wedge gate valves, starting with the 9 inch, 10,000 psi size. These valves are used on critical wellheads and allow the integrity of the gate seal to be checked internally, independent of the well bore. Another product innovation in 2012 was the development and validation of a complete 18-3/4 15,000-psi dual metal-to-metal full bore wellhead system.
9 Table of Contents OneSubsea is currently focused on several areas of new technology development including processing, controls, optimization and high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) applications. As an example, in 2013, OneSubsea received an award for its first modern HPHT vertical monobore tree for use in the North Sea following several years of design work and qualification testing. Also in 2013, OneSubsea completed the design and qualification testing for its first wet gas compression system for use in the North Sea and delivered its first high pressure, high power multiphase pump for a deepwater project in the Gulf of Mexico.
Custom Process Systems continues to improve its CO 2 membrane technology. A new CO 2 membrane product was released in 2012 with capabilities to handle higher natural gas pressures and lower CO 2 concentrations, which will be primarily marketed for on-shore gas processing applications. This technology is a replacement for older amine acid gas removal systems, but has a significant lower operating cost, modular construction and a smaller footprint.
In 2011, CPS began offering Bilectric  HF, an improved desalting technology which combines our established Bilectric desalting product with the performance enhancements achieved by our Dual Frequency  power units. This hybrid of two established technologies will provide producers and refiners with improved desalting and dehydration performance on difficult oils.
Utilizing the Companys knowledge of high-speed turbomachinery and fluid dynamics, Cameron engineers volunteered their time in 2012 and 2013 to work with surgeons at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, Texas to develop a new heart pump to potentially become the worlds first pulseless artificial heart.
Competition Cameron competes in all areas of its operations with a number of other companies, some of which have financial and other resources comparable to or greater than those of Cameron.
Cameron has a leading position in the petroleum production equipment markets. In these markets, Cameron competes principally with Aker Solutions, Balon Corporation, Circor International, Inc., Dover Corporation, Dril-Quip, Inc., Emerson Process Management, FlowServ Corp., FMC Technologies, Inc., GE Oil & Gas Group, Master Flo (a Stream-Flo Industries Ltd. company), National Oilwell Varco Inc., PBV-USA, Inc. (a Zy-Tech Global Industries company), Petrovalve (a Flotek Industries, Inc. company), Pibiviese, Robbins & Myers Fluid Management Group, SPX Corporations Flow Technology Segment, Tyco International Ltd. and the Artificial Lift Systems business of Weatherford, Ltd.
The principal competitive factors in the petroleum production equipment markets are technology, quality, service and price. Cameron believes several factors give it a strong competitive position in these markets. Most significant are Camerons broad product offering, its worldwide presence and reputation, its service and repair capabilities, its expertise in high-pressure technology and its experience in alliance and partnership arrangements with customers and other suppliers.
Although Cameron reached an agreement in January 2014 to sell its Reciprocating Compression business, and intends to evaluate strategic alternatives during 2014 for its Centrifugal Compression business, the Company has historically had an established position in the compression equipment markets. In these markets, Cameron has competed principally with Ariel Corporation, Atlas-Copco AB, Dresser-Rand, FS-Elliott Company LLC, GE Oil and Gas Group, Hoerbiger Group, Ingersoll-Road, MAN Turbo, Samsung Techwin and Siemens. The principal competitive factors in the compression equipment markets have been engineering and design capabilities, product performance, reliability, quality, service and price. Cameron has maintained a competent engineering staff and skilled technical and service representatives.
10 Table of Contents Manufacturing Cameron has manufacturing facilities worldwide that conduct a broad variety of processes, including machining, fabrication, assembly and testing, using a variety of forged and cast alloyed steels and stainless steel as the primary raw materials. Cameron has, at various times, rationalized plants and products, closed various manufacturing facilities, moved product lines to achieve economies of scale, and upgraded other facilities.The Company has also recently constructed or begun construction on new facilities, mainly in certain locations outside of North America, in order to meet current and expected future demand, particularly with regard to its drilling, surface and subsea product offerings.This is an ongoing process as the Company seeks ways to improve delivery performance and reduce costs.Cameron maintains advanced manufacturing, quality assurance and testing equipment geared to the specific products that it manufactures and uses process automation in its manufacturing operations.Manufacturing facilities typically utilize computer-aided, numeric-controlled tools and manufacturing techniques that concentrate the equipment necessary to produce similar products in one area of the plant in a configuration commonly known as a manufacturing cell.One operator in a manufacturing cell can monitor and operate several machines, as well as assemble and test products made by such machines, thereby improving operating efficiency and product quality.
Camerons test capabilities are critical to its overall processes. The Company has the capability to test most equipment at rated operating conditions, measuring all operating parameters, efficiency and emissions. All process compressors for air separation and all plant air compressors are given a mechanical and aerodynamic test in a dedicated test center prior to shipment.
All of Camerons Asian, European and Latin American manufacturing plants are ISO certified and API licensed, and most of the U.S. plants are ISO certified. ISO is an internationally recognized verification system for quality management.
Backlog Camerons backlog was approximately $11.5 billion at December 31, 2013 (approximately 46% of which is expected to be shipped during 2014), as compared to $8.6 billion at December 31, 2012, and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2011.Backlog consists of customer orders for which a purchase order or contract has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property As part of its ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, Cameron has a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions involving new products and product improvements. Cameron owns 490 unexpired United States patents and 1,294 unexpired foreign patents. During 2013, 93 new U.S. and 68 new foreign patent applications were filed.
Although, in the aggregate, these patents are of considerable importance to the manufacturing of many of its products, Cameron does not consider any single patent or group of patents to be material to its business as a whole.
Trademarks are also of considerable importance to the marketing of Camerons products. Cameron considers the following trade names to be material to its business as a whole: CAMERON, COOPER-BESSEMER, AJAX, WILLIS, W-K-M, NATCO and LeTourneau. Other important trademarks used by Cameron are included under Markets and Products above. Cameron has registered trademarks in countries where such registration is deemed important. Cameron has the right to use the trademark Joy on aftermarket parts until November 2027.
Cameron also relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. Cameron routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, partners and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to Camerons trade secrets.
Employees As of December 31, 2013, Cameron had over 29,000 employees, of which nearly 20% were represented by labor unions.
During 2013, the Company entered into new labor agreements with more than 2,500 employees, primarily in Brazil, Romania, the United Kingdom and Norway.

The table below shows the number of significant operating manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and aftermarket facilities and sales and administrative offices by business segment and geographic area at December 31, 2013. DPS and V&M share space in certain facilities and, thus, are being reported together.
Americas Asia/Pacific and Middle East Europe/Africa/ Caspian/Russia Total DPS and V&M Number of locations 158 43 43 244 Square footage : Owned 6,456,046 18,729 3,949,298 10,424,073 Leased 3,436,301 4,151,531 1,356,114 8,943,946 PCS Number of locations 52 10 4 66 Square footage : Owned 1,421,639   1,421,639 Leased 1,220,899 485,554 58,850 1,765,303 Corporate Number of locations 4 1 2 7 Square footage : Owned     Leased 409,989 19,098 13,149 442,236 Total Number of locations 214 54 49 317 Square footage : Owned 7,877,685 18,729 3,949,298 11,845,712 Leased 5,067,189 4,656,183 1,428,113 11,151,485 The Companys operations in the Americas are mainly located in North and South America.

Cameron believes its facilities are suitable for their present and intended purposes and are adequate for the Companys current and anticipated level of operations.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to a number of contingencies, including litigation, tax contingencies and environmental matters.
Litigation The Company also has been and continues to be named as a defendant in a number of multi-defendant, multi-plaintiff tort lawsuits. At December 31, 2013, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a liability of approximately $14.8 million for such cases. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that the potential exposure from these suits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
14 Table of Contents Tax and Other Contingencies The Company has legal entities in over 50 countries. As a result, the Company is subject to various tax filing requirements in these countries. The Company prepares its tax filings in a manner which it believes is consistent with such filing requirements. However, some of the tax laws and regulations to which the Company is subject require interpretation and/or judgment. Although the Company believes the tax liabilities for periods ending on or before the balance sheet date have been adequately provided for in the financial statements, to the extent a taxing authority believes the Company has not prepared its tax filings in accordance with the authoritys interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, the Company could be exposed to additional taxes.
The Company has been assessed customs duties and penalties by the government of Brazil totaling almost $50.0 million at December 31, 2013, including interest accrued at local country rates, following a customs audit for the years 2003-2010. The Company filed an administrative appeal and believes a majority of this assessment will ultimately be proven to be incorrect because of numerous errors in the assessment, and because the government has not provided appropriate supporting documentation for the assessment. As a result, the Company currently expects no material adverse impact on its results of operations or cash flows as a result of the ultimate resolution of this matter. No amounts have been accrued for this assessment as of December 31, 2013 as no loss is currently considered probable.
Environmental Matters The Company is currently identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to two sites designated for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state laws. One of these sites is Osborne, Pennsylvania (a landfill into which a predecessor of the PCS operation in Grove City, Pennsylvania deposited waste), where remediation was completed in 2011 and remaining costs relate to ongoing ground water monitoring. The other is believed to be a de minimis exposure. The Company is also engaged in site cleanup under the Voluntary Cleanup Plan of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality at former manufacturing locations in Houston and Missouri City, Texas. Additionally, the Company has discontinued operations at a number of other sites which had been active for many years and which may have yet undiscovered contamination. The Company does not believe, based upon information currently available, that there are any material environmental liabilities existing at these locations. At December 31, 2013, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $3.2 million for these environmental matters.
In 2001, the Company discovered that contaminated underground water from the former manufacturing site in Houston referenced above had migrated under an adjacent residential area. Pursuant to applicable state regulations, the Company notified the affected homeowners. Concerns over the impact on property values of the underground water contamination and its public disclosure led to a number of claims by homeowners. The Company has settled these claims, primarily as a result of the settlement of a class action lawsuit, and is obligated to reimburse approximately 190 homeowners for any diminution in value of their property due to contamination concerns at the time of the propertys sale. Test results of monitoring wells on the southeastern border of the plume indicate that the plume is moving in a new direction, likely as a result of a ground water drainage system completed as part of an interstate highway improvement project. As a result, the Company notified 39 additional homeowners, and may provide notice to additional homeowners, whose property is adjacent to the class area that their property may be affected. The Company is reviewing whether additional remedial measures are appropriate. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that any potential exposure from existing agreements as well as any possible new claims that may be filed with respect to this underground water contamination will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a liability of approximately $7.1 million for these matters as of December 31, 2013.
The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, passed by the United States Congress and signed into law in August 2012, requires companies to report certain prohibited activities or conduct that were knowingly engaged in by the company or any of its affiliates involving Iran or other parties named therein. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company had no such activities or conduct to report.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys Sarbanes-Oxley Disclosure Committee and the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2013.
In conducting managements evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting, the businesses contributed by Schlumberger in connection with the formation of OneSubsea and Douglas Chero, acquired in 2013, were excluded. Excluding goodwill, these operations accounted for less than 15% of total and net assets as of December 31, 2013 and less than 5% of the Companys consolidated revenues and income before income taxes for the year then ended.
Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
